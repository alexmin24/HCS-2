{"title": "Back in the Driver's Seat: Duke Relishes Pizza, Victory | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>MANCHESTER, N.H.--Hundreds of jubilant staffers and voters piled into a renovated ware-house here to congratulate Gov. Michael S. Dukakis on his overwhelming victory yesterday--the largest margin in the history of the nation's first primary.</span></p> <p><span>Chewing on pizza and hot dogs with all the fixings and with a recording of Neil Diamond's \"America\" playing in the background, supporters listened to the governor thank New Hampshire for giving him a strong and much-needed victory.</span></p> <p><span>In the past week, Dukakis staffers intensified their campaigning and media blitz in an effort to quell fears that the governor was slipping in popularity following his third place showing in the Iowa caucuses.</span></p> <p><span>The neighboring governor faced heavy pressure for a good showing in New Hampshire yesterday, where he was expected to do well because of his vocal opposition to the Seabrook nuclear power plant and his frequent appearances on Massachusetts news broadcasts seen in the state.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis's victory was widely seen to be a triumph of organization on par with the extraordinary organizing drive that catapaulted Republican helpful Pat Robertson to victory in Iowa.</span></p> <p><span>The Dukakis campaign, which all camps described as impeccably well-organized, claimed to have made 250,000 calls to test the preferences of New Hampshire's 145,000 voters. The Dukakis canvassers set out in teams, each armed with a high-lighted section of the Manchester city map and a set of computer cards identifying voters by everything from their ratings on a five point scale to special interests or activities.</span></p> <p><span>The win is certain to set the pace for Dukakis march South this week, where he will join the six other Democratic contenders in a contest which is predicted to be close.</span></p> <p><span>While political experts predicted a win in New Hampshire, they stressed that the victory needed to be extremely solid in order for him to be a viable candidate in the Democratic race. Yesterday's results gave Dukakis 36 percent of the vote with 93 percent of the precincts reporting, a significant margin over the second place winner Gephardt with 20 percent and Simon with 17 percent.</span></p> <p><span>\"Last week, in lowa, our message started to shine through,\" Dukakis said last night. \"We won a bronze. Tonight our message came through loud and clear. We went for the gold, and we won it,\" the governor said as his wife Kitty placed a gold medal around his neck.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's a message tonight that goes far beyond New Hampshire and New England--a message that speaks to all Americans,\" Dukakis said.</span></p> <p><span>Though Dukakis was successful in most regions in the state, his victory was not complete. The governor lost in Manchester to Gephardt, a surprising defeat for Dukakis, whose appeal is directed at urban areas.</span></p> <p><span>\"He lost in an industrial area that he should have won because they repesent the people that his message stands for,\" said Bernard Weisman, a volunteer from Massachusetts who spent yesterday campaigning for the governor.</span></p> <p><span>\"You have to carry the large cities--those small towns don't count as much,\" Weisman said, refferring to Dukakis's sweeping victory in most of New Hampshire's smaller towns.</span></p> <p><span>However, Dukakis downplayed Gephardt's Manchester victory. \"Have you been reading the Manchester Union-Leader? Well I think that explains it,\" he said referring to the conservative newspaper, which has traditionally attacked liberals of Dukakis's stripe. \"I thought we did very well considering that.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although some pundits said Dukakis needed 50 percent of the vote to be a serious contender, the governor's huge margin of victory yeasterday will lend significant credibilty to his campaign.</span></p> <p><span>In upcoming weeks, the governor will need to build strength in the South, where he faces tough competition from Sen. Albert Gore '69 and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who have solid support in the region, and from Gephardt, whose Iowa victory and second place finish in New Hampshire will continue to fuel his momentum.</span></p> <p><span>Simon's campaign had been counting on a second place finish here in order to prevent the race from becoming a Dukakis-Gephardt showdown. When asked if Simon's third place finish will force the Illinois senator out of the race, Dukakis said, \"No, I don't, but I think it would be very difficult for him now.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Sound and Fury, Signifying Nothing | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>L</b>IKE most Americans, I tuned in last week to watch Vice President George Bush and Governor Michael S. Dukakis square off in the first of three presidential debates. Although I enjoyed watching Bush feebly defend his demagogic attacks on Dukakis' patriotism, I left highly skeptical of the value of these quadrennial exercises for the American voter.</span></p> <p><span>Granted, for the candidates these debates are a highly effective, inexpensive way for them to hammer out their major themes and to paint their opponents as soft on crime, disingenuous or unpatriotic in the public eye. But does the highly rigid structure of these debates really help the American voter make a more informed choice over which candidates would make the better president? Maybe, but I doubt it.</span></p> <p><span>After all, with candidates given only a minute to sum up their positions on such complex issues as arms control, the budget deficit, or the Middle East, the debates make simplistic slogans like \"no new taxes,\" abortion is murder,\" and \"I won't touch Social Security,\" seem acceptable. No candidate who actually hopes to win will dare say that he will raise taxes to bring down the budget deficit, or purposely bring up any other issue of substance. Despite professing sympathy to the needs of all Americans, candidates often seem to adopt the condescending attitude that by speaking in vague generalities, they'll con the living daylights out of them.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, under the current set-up neither the panelists nor the other candidate can stop his opponent in midstream and point out that what he just said was factually incorrect. As a result, Bush was able to duck a tough question asking which weapons systems he opposed by naming a few which the Pentagon has already scrapped. Theoretically, Dukakis could have done so on his own time, but it would have taken 10-15 seconds off the minute he had to tell us how he would make health care and housing affordable to all.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>OO often, it seems, the substance of what the candidates are saying gets ignored, while the one-liners, makeup, tone, self-assurance and gaffes of each of the candidates inevitably determine the outcome. In other words, the one with the best sound bites \"wins.\"</span></p> <p><span>Historians agree that John F. Kennedy \"won\" his 1960 debate with Richard Nixon not on substantive issues, but because Nixon showed up on national television looking pale and nervous. The 1976 debate between Ford and Carter is remembered, not for its arguments over the state of the economy or the proper U.S. role in world affairs, but rather for Ford's strange assertion that Poland was not under Soviet domination. A mere reassuring phrase from candidate Reagan, \"there you go again,\" was enough to stave off an issue-oriented Carter attack in 1980.</span></p> <p><span>At the end of all these debates, reporters inevitably swarm around the spokesmen for both campaigns to hear them say what they're paid to say--that their man won. The need for reporters and camera crews to convey the obviously highly partisan opinions of these campaign strategists to millions of Americans is dubious.</span></p> <p><span>In the end, for all its harping on both candidates for negative campaigning and failing to address the pressing issues of the day, the media this year merely helped contribute to the superficial nature of the process by mocking Bush's goofiness and Dukakis' attempts to smile in articles, editorials, and news reports analyzing the debate.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>F course, it's easy to criticize the existing system of presidential debates without proposing any remedies. One idea that has been suggested, and which seems to make a lot more sense, is to give two or three political allies for each candidate a chance to grill the opposition.</span></p> <p><span>Under such a system, Jesse Jackson could nail Bush on the Reagan Administration's attempts to gut the Voting Rights Act and to reduce federal grants for low-income students. Sam Nunn or Al Gore could specifically pinpoint wasteful defense systems and force Bush to explain how he would guard against another procurement mess in the Pentagon.</span></p> <p><span>On the Republican side, Jack Kemp could ask Dukakis what he would do as president if, with aid to the contras cut off, the Sandinistas suddenly renege on their promises to abide by the Arias Plan, cracking down on all internal opposition. Bob Dole could demand that Dukakis explain what exactly \"good jobs at good wages\" means and how he would achieve such a goal without unleashing inflation.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>T the very least, the candidates should be allowed to question each other and be given more time to state their positions, so that they don't feel compelled to speak in vague truisms the way they do even now.</span></p> <p><span>While elitists on both sides would probably argue that such an arrangement would bore the supposedly simpleminded American voter--a justification they have used before to limit the number of debates--the chances are that these voters would appreciate not being patronized. More likely than not, these same voters care enough about the plight of America's farmers and its homeless, the drug problem, the AIDS crisis and our ability to compete in the international marketplace to sit up and pay attention.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Dukakis, Bush Win N.H. Primary Battles; Gephardt Beats Simon for Second Place | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>CONCORD, N.H.--Vice President George Bush sped past Sen. Bob Dole (R.-Kan.) in New Hampshire's Republican presidential primary yesterday, while Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis won the Democratic contest handily.</span></p> <p><span>Bush rebounded from a third-place finish in last week's Iowa caucuses, winning 38 percent of the GOP vote to Dole's 29 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Rep. Jack Kemp (R.-N.Y.) narrowly defeated Pete du Pont and Pat Robertson in the competition for third place, emerging as a conservative alternative to the front-runners. But the group was clumped far behind Bush and Dole.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis won 36 percent of the vote and said his showing would \"give us a very, very strong boost\" going into the delegate-rich Southern primaries ahead. The distant but hotly contested second place went to Rep. Richard Gephardt (D.-Mo.), 20 percent, with Sen. Paul Simon (D.-III.) at 17 percent.</span></p> <p><span>\"I love New Hampshire,\" the Missouri congressman said. But Simon, a narrow second-place to Gephardt in Iowa, conceded nothing.</span></p> <p><span>A triumphant Dukakis told his supporters, \"Ten months ago we launched a campaign for the future of America, a campaign for good jobs and real opportunity for every citizen...a campaign to get our fiscal house in order.\"</span></p> <p><span>In a hint that his southern campaign will concentrate on urban areas, Dukakis mentioned Miami, Atlanta, Norfolk and Selma in his speech. The governor insists, however, that he will campaign in all parts of the South.</span></p> <p><span>The speech proposed unity and optimism, avoiding specifics and political details.</span></p> <p><span>Boston-based political consultant Michael Goldman said the governor's victory left him strongly positioned for a run in the South. He said Gephardt is nearly out of money and Simon is all but out of the race. Goldman said the crowded field actually helped the governor by preventing any one candidate from garnering an anti-Dukakis vote.</span></p> <p><span>Goldman said Dukakis plans to spend nearly $4 million in the South, more even than Sen. Albert Gore (D.-Ten.), who has planned a $1 million media campaign.</span></p> <p><span>The effort earned Dukakis a bronze medal in Iowa, he said, and in next-door New Hamshire, \"We went for the gold and we won it.\"</span></p> <p><span>CBS, reporting on the basis of interviews with voters leaving their polling places, said President Reagan's popularity in the Granite State helped Bush considerably. Other pollsters concurred, and said Dukakis also profited from his long tenure as governor of a neighboring state.</span></p> <p><span>With 94 percent of the precincts reporting, Dukakis was likely to receive 9 Democratic convention delegates, Gephardt 6 and Simon 3. That would raise the national totals to 44.50 for Dukakis, 39 for Gephardt, and 33 for Simon. In all, 2082 delegates are needed to win the Democratic presidential nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Jesse Jackson and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D.-Tenn.), were denied the boost they sought as the primary campaign moves to their native South, trailing with 8 percent and 7 percent of the vote. Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt had 5 percent and was a candidate for withdrawal. Long-ago front-runner Gary Hart had 4 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Gore already had commitments for 10.55 delegate votes at the convention, Jackson had 9.80 and Babbitt four.</span></p> <p><span>In the Republican race, Bush led with 11 New Hampshire delegates, Dole seven, Kemp three and du Pont two. Those results would raise their national totals to 61 for Bush, 42 for Dole, 35 for Kemp and two for du Pont. In all, 1139 delegates are needed to win the Republican presidential nomination. Empty-handed yesterday, Robertson already had won eight delegates.</span></p> <p><span>The final number of delegates was not available last night, but the latest unofficial tally of the popular vote, with 99 percent of the precincts reporting, shows the following:</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis, with 41,185 votes, received 37 percent. Gephardt, remaining at 20 percent, received 22,464 votes. Simon's 17 percent was also stable, with 19,432 votes. Jackson, at 8 percent, received 9062; Gore, 7 percent or 7698; Babbitt, 5 percent or 5334; Hart, 4549 or 4 percent, and others with 2601 votes or 2 percent.</span></p> <p><span>The comparable results for the Republicans showed Bush with 54,915 or 38 percent; Dole, 41,746 or 29 percent; Kemp, 18,367 or 13 percent; du Pont, 14,448 or 10 percent; Robertson, 13,839 or 10 percent; Haig, 522, or less than 1 percent. The remaining Republican candidates received a total of 511 votes.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Bolt from Above | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>L</b>IKE thunder from heaven, the religious right of the Republican party will make itself heard again today when they turn out to vote for Marion G. (Pat) Robertson. After his strong second-place finish in lowa last week, the former TV evangelist--who has said his faith diverted a hurricane in Virginia and claimed that he could cure the hemorrhoids of his followers--has turned topsy-turvy the GOP presidential race.</span></p> <p><span>While Bush and Dole, Kemp and Du Pont have viciously attacked each other in debates and TV commercials, the Republican hopefuls have shied away from criticizing Robertson. His strong showings in Hawaii, Michigan, and lowa have convinced the other candidates that Robertson and the white, fundamentalist nonvoters he has recruited into the Republican fold are a force to be reckoned with. This hands-off policy toward Robertson has prevented an honest evaluation of his record, and his success has nudged the other candidates farther toward the right.</span></p> <p><span>But the hopefuls must ask themselves how far they are willing to go. On close examination, Robertson's views are far beyond the prevailing currents of mainstream political thought, making Du Pont look like an FDR liberal.</span></p> <p><span>In the area of foreign affairs and economics, the founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network and the 700 Club program shows little expertise. At a debate Sunday night he claimed that the Soviets had placed 25 nuclear missiles in Cuba and in previous statements he has promised to send aid to Polish rebels and to make future wars short because \"we could have won Vietnam in a week or two.\" To solve the budget deficit, Robertson favors a \"year of jubilee\" in which all debts would be forgiven and has proposed selling the U.S. Post Office to raise revenue.</span></p> <p><span>Robertson's ridiculous policies make him unfit to hold the nation's highest office, but his personal comments make him even more so. A few years ago Robertson said that \"Christians and Jews are the only ones qualified\" to hold public office in the United States. He has written that wives should \"be willing to submit\" to husbands and said that women merely \"house babies.\" The TV evangelist has not denied he would quarantine AIDS victims; in 1980 he prophesized the end of the world two years later, and a few years ago wrote that there was a strong possibility the Antichrist walks among us even now.</span></p> <p><span>Clearly these statements do not reflect the views of a man sane enough to guide this nation at one of its most critical times. However, Robertson's three strong primary finishes show that a substantial number of conservative voters have picked up Robertson's banner--making him a dangerous factor in the Republican convention and possibly even a presidential nominee. This is a serious threat--one that would destroy many of the things America stands for--and should be treated more seriously than it is now. If New Hampshire voters fail to stop Robertson now, Americans in the rest of the primary states better not wait until a bolt from above does.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Scouting Report | Sports | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>Harvard</b></span></p> <p><span><b>Quarterback:</b> Tom was terrific even in defeat. Last week against the University of Massachusetts, Tom Yohe completed 20 of 36 passes for 312 yards, the third-best passing day in Harvard history. He is second on the team in rushing with 65 yards. He can do it all. Sometimes, as against UMass, he is forced to.</span></p> <p><span><b>Running Backs:</b> Last year, Tony Hinz did not get to play against Holy Cross because of an injury. Although it's unlikely Harvard would have won the game--the score was Holy Cross 41, Harvard 6--he certainly would have helped. This year he has 201 yards rushing (a 5.6 per-carry average) and two touchdowns.</span></p> <p><span><b>Receivers:</b> Although Harvard still mourns the graduation of All-Ivy wideout Brian Barringer, the Crimson has gotten some good play from split end Neil Phillips (five receptions for 101 yards and a touchdown) and tight end Don Gajewski (89 yards receiving and a last name most visiting radio announcers botch--it's guy-EF-skee, guys.)</span></p> <p><span><b>Offensive Line:</b> Last week, UMass proved challenging for the anonymous bunch in front of Yohe. Still, Harvard has a fine unit, led by tackle Maurice Frilot, whom Crusader Coach Mark Duffner called one of the best at his position. Duffner also cited Shawn Sensky, Tony Consigli and John Bartholomew--in other words, Duffner's concerned about Harvard's entire line.</span></p> <p><span><b>Defensive Line:</b> Harvard got mowed down convincingly by UMass last week. But don't expect Captain and defensive end Don Peterson to let this unit rest today. Along with defensive tackle Jim Bell, Peterson provides the heat opposing quarterbacks would rather avoid. If Peterson and friends can get to Wiley often, Harvard will win the game.</span></p> <p><span><b>Linebackers:</b> This duo is forced to make most of the Crimson's tackles, not a good sign. The linebackers are a second line of defense against the run, and Greg Ubert (12 tackles against UMass) and Brian Burns (10 tackles) proved capable of bringing down the Minutemen's big running backs. Ubert had trouble covering some of the UMass backs on pass plays, however.</span></p> <p><span><b>Secondary:</b> Free safety Jim Smith had 10 tackles last week against UMass. Smith should like playing the Cross. Last year he took over for injured Bryan Gescuk and intercepted Wiley twice. Look out, Jeff. Sophomore cornerback Chris Rezendes recorded his first career interception last week against the Minutemen.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Holy Cross</i></b></span></p> <p><span><b>Quarterback:</b> Last year, Jeff Wiley was the top-ranked passer in Division I-AA. This year, he's having his troubles (nine interceptions), mainly because of an inexperienced receiving corps. But Wiley is still a man to be watched. He has completed 64 of 113 passes for 806 yards with four touchdowms.</span></p> <p><span><b>Running Backs:</b> It was bad enough losing Heisman Trophy finalist Gordon Lockbaum to graduation. But early this season, the Cross lost junior fullback Willie Bradford to a knee injury. Although primarily a passing team, the Crusaders get good ground mileage out of fullback Joe Segreti (266 yards rushing in four games, a 4.8 per-carry average).</span></p> <p><span><b>Receivers:</b> Here, too, Mr. Lockbaum is missed. Instead of Flash Gordon, Wiley has had to rely on a sophomore, Mark Gallagher, and his tailback, Tim Donovan, to catch his passes. Donovan has 15 receptions. Gallagher is short (5-ft., 9-in.), but he's quick. He has 13 receptions. This year Wiley is shooting for the 10,000 career passing mark. These folks will have to help him.</span></p> <p><span><b>Offensive Line:</b> Tom Hanks would feel right at home on this unit. How big are these fellows? All-Colonial conference players Mark Stoy (right tackle) and Dennis Golden (right guard) are both over 250 pounds. Do you suppose that when the Crusaders run, they might favor the right side? Look out, a couple of tanks ahead.</span></p> <p><span><b>Defensive Line:</b> The Crusaders have not allowed a first-quarter touchdown all year. Credit must go to middle guard Gerry Trietley (6-ft., 2-in., 220-lbs.) and defensive end Tom Smith, who has made 27 tackles in four games. Yohe found the Crusaders' front five tough to deal with last year. If the Cross proves equally as ferocious, look for a Crusader blowout.</span></p> <p><span><b>Linebackers:</b> McGovern, McGovern he's their man. If he can't do it, Maruca can. Rob McGovern leads the team in tackles with 65. He gets help from two-year starter Chris Maruca. They'll be tested when Tony Hinz comes out of the Harvard backfield to catch passes.</span></p> <p><span><b>Secondary:</b> Cornerback Dave Murphy is a man to beware of. He collects interceptions the way George Bush collects American flags. He was third in the nation in interceptions last year, but has tailed off a little this year--he has just one pick-off. But if Yohe is just a little off...In addition to his intercepting prowess, Murphy has 28 tackles.</span></p>"}
{"title": "At Election Time, Profs Consider the D.C. Life | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Vice President George Bush called Harvard \"the boutique of liberal ideas\" this summer in the course attaching the \"L-word\" to his Democratic rival, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.</span></p> <p><span>The Democratic nominee graduated from the Law School in 1960, taught at the Kennedy School of Government for three years, and draws many of his top campaign advisers from the University.</span></p> <p><span>Cantabridgians, from President Bok to Kennedy School Dean Graham T. Allison '62, first actively disputed the notion that the University is a vast Democratic think tank united behind the Dukakis campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\"Maybe in the context of all the colleges in the country we are on the liberal side, but I would never say that we are more liberal than any other institution like Yale, for instance,\" Bok said in a recent interview. \"What does that mean? What are the criteria for 'liberal'? I wouldn't even know how to figure that out.\"</span></p> <p><span>And they raise another question. If Dukakis draws on a Harvard \"boutique\" for his ideas, as Bush charged, recent events have raised another question--what is the appropriate term for the many advisers within the University working for Bush in his bid for the White House?</span></p> <p><span>But, as the election enters its final weeks these quarrels become less important and the big riddle campaign watchers now ponder is which ivory-tower advisers will become Washington-bound paper pushers and which will continue to publish papers.</span></p> <p><span>In this election year, attention has focused on the Kennedy School, where Dukakis served as a lecturer between his first two terms as governor. And recently Bok and Allison have joined in the speculation about which K-School profs would join their former colleague should he win in November.</span></p> <p><span>Bok, who is himself considered a possible political appointee in a Democratic administration, says that he and Allison \"discussed whatever plans we can so we won't be left short of faculty members or have to fold or anything.\"</span></p> <p><span>Many cite the story of Dukakis' staffing decisions in 1982, when he was re-elected governor after a three-year stint at the Kennedy School, as evidence of what might happen this time around if the Democrats take the White House. Allison says that he was forced to personally negotiate a hiring freeze with Dukakis after the gubernatorial election because the former lecturer lured away so many of his K-School colleagues.</span></p> <p><span>Allison and Ford Foundation Professor of International Security Joseph S. Nye are the two most mentioned possible Dukakis appointees this election. Allison announced last summer that he would resign his post as dean, effective in the 1989-'90 academic year. Many speculated at the time that Allison was trying to free himself for a Washington job in a Dukakis administration.</span></p> <p><span>But Allison, who is mentioned as a possible national security adviser or secretary of defense, disavowed any intention to join the migration to Washington should Dukakis, a close personal friend of the dean's, win.</span></p> <p><span>Nye refuses to comment on his job prospects in a Democratic administration, but the professor, who is on leave this semester, has been a top foreign policy adviser to Dukakis. Nye, who was an undersecretary of state under President Jimmy Carter, traveled to North Carolina to brief the governor on foreign policy issues before last week's presidential debate. Observers have mentioned Nye as a candidate for top posts including Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense.</span></p> <p><span>Academic Dean Albert Carnesale, who has advised Dukakis on nuclear power issues, including the controversial evacuation plans involving the Seabrook, N.H. nuclear power plant, is also mentioned as a possible appointee, as is Lecturer in Public Policy Robert Reich, an economist with strong ties to the Democratic party.</span></p> <p><span>On the other side of the political fence, Institute of Politics Director Richard L. Thornburgh is currently on leave to serve as attorney general, and many say that the former Pennsylvania governor will be asked to stay on, should the Republicans retain control of the White House.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy School Lecturer in Public Policy Richard N. Haass has already been tapped as a foreign policy adviser to the Bush campaign, presumably with the promise of a post after a Bush victory.</span></p> <p><span>And Professor of Government Roger Porter, a Reagan White House appointee, may be asked back to Washington in the advent of a GOP triumph. This semester, Porter is teaching a popular course on the presidency that may presage his return to the capital.</span></p> <p><span>Yet the list of prospective presidential advisers extends beyond the realm of the Kennedy School. First, there are the expected names: for Dukakis, Professor of Law Susan Estrich, his campaign manager, and Professor of Law Christopher Edley, his issues director, can be expected to garner Washington titles if their candidate wins.</span></p> <p><span>And for Bush, Associate Professor of Economics Lawrence B. Lindsey, one of the vice president's top economic advisers, said this week that he might consider a move to the capital. Lindsey, who counsels Bush on a variety of taxation issues, is the head section leader for Social Analysis 10, \"Principles of Economics,\" which is one of the College's largest courses. And professors said this week that contingency plans are already in the making to replace Lindsey should Bush tap him for a Washington position.</span></p> <p><span>But as Baker Professor of Economics Martin S. Feldstein '61, another top Bush adviser, cautions, a high-profile campaign role does not mean that a scholar will necessarily be offered--or accept--a government post.</span></p> <p><span>Feldstein, despite a mention by Bush in last Sunday's presidential debate, said this week that he is \"not expecting to leave, no matter what the outcome\" of the presidential election.</span></p> <p><span>The professor, who served as the head of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, refused to elaborate on his decision not to seek a job in Washington should Bush win. But he has already taken on spring semester obligations, including advising at least one senior thesis, which make it unlikely he will depart for D.C. at least in the short run.</span></p> <p><span>And another Economics scholar, Ropes Professor of Political Economy Lawrence H. Summers, one of Dukakis' chief economics advisers, echoed Feldstein's comments, saying he too was planning to stay in Cambridge. Summers said he has accepted four or five senior theses as part of his spring semester commitments on campus.</span></p> <p><span>But even as the speculation continues, many influential campaign officials echo Bok's attitude toward a possible position in a new presidential administration: \"The thought never crossed my mind.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "A Word to the Wise, Advice to the Ailing | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>O</b>ver the last ten days, television has been consumed by \"Campaign '88\" coverage--even though the nation's viewers would prefer \"Calgary '88.\" Consequently, we have witnessed a multitude of post-primary prognoses. Some have been accurate, others interesting, but most simply repetitive. It's time the candidates distill these messages into simple terms and answer the question that must be on everyone's mind: \"Where do we go from here?\"</span></p> <p><span><b>THE DEMOCRATS</b></span></p> <p><span>Rep. Richard Gephardt: Momentum. He's got it, moving from 6 percent in New Hampshire polls three weeks ago to 20 percent in Tuesday's primary. Now, he has to be sure to hang onto it--even if that means darkening his eyebrows.</span></p> <p><span>Gephardt has spent more time in the South than any other Democratic candidate and has aquired enormous backing from his House colleagues. All of which should mean a super showing in Super Tuesday--and beyond. His potential problem: will he be able to justify his inconsistent voting record, particularly his support for 1985 Reagan tax law, or will he appear a political weathervane?</span></p> <p><span>Gov. Michael Dukakis: Massachusetts. Can a Northeast liberal sell in Birmingham, Alabama? Like Gephardt, he too has great momentum building for Super Tuesday. And unlike Gephardt he has a strong financial base. But, in the next 19 days he must capitalize on his standing in the polls. Strong showings--if not victories--in next week's Minnesota, South Dakota, and South Carolina primaries are essential.</span></p> <p><span>While the governor predicts that his message for new employment and training initiatives, better industrial relations and improved education will assure a Southern victory, his superior Southern organization and the nod from influential Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton are critical assurances.</span></p> <p><span>Sen. Paul Simon: Money. And, boy does he need it! Rivaling Gephardt for the number two spot in New Hampshire forced Simon to flood the airwaves with advertising and, in the process, empty his warchest.</span></p> <p><span>While Simon gained virtually the same number of delegates as the other two Democratic front-runners, he failed to gain the essential momentum. A few failed percentage points mean a loss of crucial fundraising opportunities--and may prophesy the beginning of the end. If Simon does not win in one of next Tuesday's Minnesota or South Dakota primaries, he will leave the presidential race, he announced yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>Rev. Jesse Jackson: Minority. His performances in Iowa and New Hampshire have proven that he has won over substantial white support. His grassroots organization of Southern voters guarantees him Super Tuesday success. Since the Democratic Party is trying to overcome the factional interests that plagued it in 1984 and will probably not opt for a Black candidate, the most he can hope for is kingmaker status at the convention and support for a future run for a senatorial or gubernatorial office.</span></p> <p><span>Sen. Albert Gore: Mystery. Gore has put very little time into either Iowa or New Hampshire and is banking on an amazing Super Tuesday sweep. No president since 1952 has won election without taking New Hampshire first, so how or why Gore plans to do the impossible remains to be seen. He will have a few more problems, namely his excessive ambition and the growing bickering between his and Rep. Gephardt's campaigns. But he certainly cannot be discounted. The Tennessee senator is one of the Democratic Party's rising stars and a likely vice presidential candidate.</span></p> <p><span>Bruce Babbitt: Maybe Next Time. The Former Arizona Governor made a fatal political flaw: telling the truth about his tax policy (Walter Mondale made the same mistake). While Babbitt's national consumption tax won him some valuable media attention, it won very few real votes. Because of this poor showing, he is spending the next two days considering the future of his campaign. But, don't forget about him; the word is out that he's already looking to '92.</span></p> <p><span>Gary Hart: Maggot. Who's he trying to fool? This guy can't really expect to win--and the voters in Iowa and New Hampshire have certainly confirmed that. He has no staff, no money, no viable strategy. But, he's got one thing that's making it all wothwhile (no, not Donna)--Federal Matching Funds. He is receiving funds from the federal government that match his present campaign funds, so at least he'll be able to pay off his massive debts. What a guy.</span></p> <p><span><b>THE REPUBLICANS</b></span></p> <p><span>Vice President George Bush: Millionaire. Bush is the favored son of the Republican Party and has all the money to prove it. Consequently, he pulled off a huge media blitz against competitor Senator Robert Dole, including a half hour live talkshow. His televised attack on Dole's votes for tax increases and support for an oil import fee signal a healthy diversion from character attacks to policy criticism. His subsequent victory in New Hampshire was essential to halting Dole's post-Iowa momentum.</span></p> <p><span>As Bush moves South he heads to a region of personal strength, where his finances and contacts with Republican leaders will guarantee success. But, he and Dole still have many more battles ahead--and much more blood to shed.</span></p> <p><span>Sen. Robert Dole: Mean. The Kansas Senator is already diving into trouble with the vice president calling him a liar in New Hampshire and viciously attacking him on the floor of the Senate last week. Now that Dole is going on the offensive, his malevolent approach may damage his image as powerfully as it did in his bid for the vice presidency on the Ford ticket in 1976. What a guy to negiotiate peace treaties-- watch out Gorbachev!</span></p> <p><span>Dole is also very strong going into the South. With the benefits of his wife Elizabeth's North Carolinian background and his popularity among farmers, Dole has a basis for muscling voter support.</span></p> <p><span>Rev. Marion (Pat) Robertson: Messiah. Although the \"hand of God\" did not pull enough levers in New Hampshire, Robertson has an incredibly strong organization in the South. He has converted -- and registered -- unprecedented numbers of new Republicans from the ranks of the Democratic party and nonvoters.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately for Robertson, as the campaign wears on, he will have to seriously address the issues and at some point, the voters will no longer accept his inflamatory and disbased statements, like those made last week about Soviet missiles in Cuba. Eventually, spiritual power alone will not be satisfactory, and he will need some real political strength.</span></p> <p><span>Rep. Jack Kemp: Multi-flex. The famous former Buffalo Bills quarterback sees himself as the only candidate flexible enough to unify the three feuding factions of the Republican Party: the Reaganites, the New Right, and the Robertson Evangelicals. Unfortunately, no one seems to appreciate his flexibility--including most voters in each faction.</span></p> <p><span>Even his third place finish in Tuesday's primary was only a minor victory. The two fourth place finishers, and du Pont, were only three percentage points behind Kemp. Consequently, the New York Congressman's days are numbered; he has little momentum, less money, and no real prospect.</span></p> <p><span>Pierre (Pete) du Pont Maniac. This guy is just wasting his time. The Republican Party has many stong candidates and he is not one of them. Need I say anymore?</span></p>"}

{"title": "Mom's Leap of Faith to Pat Robertson | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>M</b>Y mom's joined the army. Not the U.S. army. My mother just joined the \"invisible army\" of former televangelist Pat Robertson.</span></p> <p><span>By now you've probably heard of Robertson's renegade band of GOP activists. Earlier this month, they ambushed Vice President George Bush in lowa, outdistancing the national frontrunner to take second place behind Sen. Robert Dole. In Hawaii they delivered 82 percent of the vote for Robertson. Quite an accomplishment for a man who claims to have diverted hurricanes and has supported a deficitcutting measure to defy all others--declaring \"a year of jubilee,\" in which all debts would be forgiven.</span></p> <p><span>So why is mom supporting the Reverend? She defies the media's stereotypical portrayal of Robertson-backers. She is not an illiterate--she has a bachelor's degree in history from North Texas State University. She's not a political novice--she's a Republican precinct committee member and has held county-wide office. And she doesn't spend much time watching television evangelists or Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network. But, come May and the less-than-crucial Oregon primary, mom will be casting her ballot for the television broadcaster from Virginia.</span></p> <p><span>Mom thinks there's something wrong with the federal government. She thought so in 1980, when she cast her ballot for California Governor Ronald Reagan. Reagan promised to reduce the bureaucracy and cut government spending, but he didn't deliver. She worried about the national debt in 1980. Reagan vowed to balance the budget, but he ran up more debt than all of his predecessors combined.</span></p> <p><span>She hoped Reagan would cut out the graft and corruption on Capitol Hill. But Reagan's buddies--Lyn Nofziger, Michael Deaver, Edwin Meese, and a couple dozen others--have been less than ethical. She wanted honesty in government--instead she got the Iran-contra scandal. She wanted a hands-on president--instead she got one who slept through Cabinet meetings and delegated decision-making to junior staff members.</span></p> <p><span>Mom is a social conservative. She wants a return to \"traditional family values,\" and she opposes Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion-on-demand. She wants a candidate who will do more than pay lip service to the Pro-Life movement, as President Reagan has done.</span></p> <p><span>George Bush is pledging to continue the \"Reagan Revolution.\" Mom doesn't want four more years. And she doesn't think Bush is telling the truth about the Iran-contra affair.</span></p> <p><span>Dole says most Americans want an \"insider,\" a president who knows how to cut deals with Congress. Perhaps Dole is right. But mom wants a president who will confront the Washington bureaucracy and the liberals in Congress. She is not looking for a great compromiser, but a great reformer.</span></p> <p><span>Jack Kemp isn't at the top of mom's list either. Kemp doesn't seem very concerned about the deficit, and he lacks charisma, she says.</span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>OM supports Pat Robertson because he's very conservative and will make sure the GOP platform stays that way. Bush and Dole pledge to broaden the base of the Republican party. But mom fears they'll compromise Republican principles in an effort to attract moderates. Robertson is broadening the base of the party, too--but he is signing up thousands of evangelicals and born-again Christians, a move mom supports. He is also wooing thousands of conservative Southern voters, who are switching party affiliation so they can vote in the GOP primaries.</span></p> <p><span>Robertson promises to bring \"moral strength\" to the White House. He vows he'll never pander to special interests, and he boasts that he doesn't owe anybody any favors. \"Nobody has any hooks in me,\" Robertson says. This is a grassroots campaign. He has raised more money than any of the Democrats and nearly as much as George Bush. But the money hasn't come from Washington insiders, Wall Street bankers or Political Action Comittees. Simple people are sending small donations--they're the reason Robertson has an enviable campaign war chest. Mom thinks Robertson won't have to spend his entire term repaying favors. And he won't have to worry about special interests when he slashes spending and government waste.</span></p> <p><span>Mom is confident that Robertson would be a competent president. His Yale degree proves he's no intellectual slouch, she says. And while the politicians have been making deals Washington, Robertson has been running one of the nation's largest cable networks. He is no hatchet man. And mom says he's friendly, with no Dolelike dark side.</span></p> <p><span>A month ago, mom did not believe that Robertson could compete with the other Republican candidates. His second place showing in lowa convinced her that Robertson can take on the Republican presidential field--and maybe even win.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Kennedy School Sexism | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>J</b>OHN F. Kennedy was the first American president to prohibit federal agencies from practicing sex discrimination in the civil service. Prior to 1963, federal jobs could routinely be set aside for men or for women only. Since then women have risen to prominent roles in business, press, polities, and in federal, state, and local government. Women serve on important corporate boards, are elected to public office and hold high ranks in the 1988 presidential campaigns. The campaign manager for Governor Michael Dukakis is a woman.</span></p> <p><span>But at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government the late President's vision of equality in the public workplace casts barely a thin shadow over the institution dedicated to the pursuit of the value of public management. In fact, students emerging from the school's prestigious Senior Executive Fellows Program--in which government agencies pay up to $17,000 per student for management training--will conclude that women are hardly protagonists in the public debate at all.</span></p> <p><span>The near absence of women as faculty members and as subjects of case study analysis suggests that, in Harvard's eyes, women would be neither leaders nor facilitators of change. The Kennedy School has one tenured faculty member who is a woman. There were eight female students in a recent class of 50 public sector executives and three female lecturers out of more than 20 males.</span></p> <p><span>Among Harvard's famed case study analyses, the number of female protagonists can be counted on one hand. Students analyze actions by federal and state bureaucracies who routinely play out roles in public drama, ignoring any number of weighty female public figures. Carla Hills, Juanita Krepps, Anne Armstrong, Nancy Kassebaum and even Massachusetts' own Margaret Heckler have escaped Harvard's notice. One exception is Anne Gorsuch-Burford. But never mind, hers is just a sideshow in the public drama starring William Ruckleshaus.</span></p> <p><span>In conversation, Peter Zimmerman, associate dean at the Kennedy School and director of the executive training programs, affirms that, \"The frequency of our focusing on women, minorities and foreign nationals is abysmal. It is a recognized problem.\" But one must ask, for a recognized problem, where is, the will to change.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>T the Kennedy School, recurring problems such as discrimination in employment, sexual harassment and male-female power roles are brushed off as \"communications\" or \"personal\" problems. Faculty advise female students not to wage such unwinnable battles as the use of gender specific pronouns. Biases and insults go unchallenged, and workplace issues are overlooked. Positive images for women in public service are virtually ignored. Instead, images in and outside of the classroom reinforce the diminished role and expectations for women. American heroes pictured in academic halls and featured speakers are, with rare exception, men. Program staff, responsible for administrative details and running errands for faculty and students are, of course, women.</span></p> <p><span>The United States Navy recently opened up thousands of new jobs to women following an internal study which found that career enhancing assignments for both enlisted women and officers were unnecessarily limited. It found frustration among its female ranks and sexual harassment rampant throughout the service. The Navy has addressed questions that the Kennedy School should not ignore. What impact does polarization among men and women, and dead-end career opportunities, have on the productivity of an organization? How can problems be identified? What can be done to ensure a work environment which discourages hostility among employees? And how does all of this change when a woman is in charge?</span></p> <p><span>If the Kennedy School is truly committed to an expanded understanding of the value and means of public management, its message that value is appraised and perpetuated men only must change. Women and racial and ethnic minorities must be incorporated into the debate about public value, in a measure at least comparable to their achievements in the world beyond Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span>I do not advocate quotas or the establishment of a consciousness-raising department of women's studies at the Kennedy School. But women must be recruited as faculty and students there. Case studies must be researched and taught to examine positive and forceful means of eroding discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace. The successes and failures of women in public policy and management need to be examined as well as those of noteworthy men.</span></p> <p><span>These are tasks that should be undertaken seriously and soon. Otherwise the boastful claims of the Kennedy School's public management programs must bear a muted footenote: within resides a vision of public value, for men only. And as long as this continues, federal policymakers must legitimately ask if either the federal government or its executive students are getting their money's worth from Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span><i>Diana Tabler is a health care policy specialist at the Department of Defense in Washington, D.C. and was a participant in the Senior Executive Fellows Program at the Kennedy School last semester.</i></span></p>"}

His supporters recognized that anything less than a victory in Minnesota would jolt his effort to prove he could win outside the Northeast.</span></p> <p><span>Gephardt ran advertisements in South Dakota asserting that Dukakis knew nothing of agriculture, recalling Dukakis' suggestion in Iowa a year ago that farmers should turn to products such as Belgian endive and blueberries.

Roosevelt '04, who barely won the nomination, was labeled by the leading columnist of the day, \"A very nice man who would very much like to be president.\" Not only did John F. Kennedy '40 barely win the nomination, his margin of victory in the general election was so small it has been alleged that he only won because of political chicanery by Daley's Chicago political machine. And our current president was best known as a joke in a Johnny Carson monologue before he managed to scale the White House walls on his second try.</span></p> <p><span>In these political days where the seven dwarves square off against Goldilocks and the three bears, it certainly is comforting to consider that one of these candidates will actually emerge from the land of make-believe and become a real flesh and blood president. But still we yearn, it appears hopelessly, for candidates with firm chins already in place, and we spend our time shaking fists at the political gods for sending us fairy tale candidates. Being presidential has become the chief issue of the 1988 campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps Reagan, JFK and FDR are to blame for this travesty of the political process. The efforts of these three men so finely tuned modern political tools of mass communication that we've forgotten that presidents are just citizens. Now, they're just an electron-etched face placed next to a bust of Lincoln. Let's face it, we're spoiled. Candidates have to meet our mass-culture image of the presidency to be considered worthy of our vote.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T used to be that presidential aspirants boasted of their log cabin roots and displayed their ability to drink hard cider. This year one candidate appeared wind-swept on the cover of a national magazine in order to fight charges by his opponents that he was, aghast, a wimp. Another candidate makes his decision to run after a public opinion poll reveals that he most looks like the commander-in-chief.</span></p> <p><span>But before we start listening to pundits pining, \"Mario, Mario wherefore art thou Mario,\" we should be thankful that this year's presidential race may allow us to return to the days when anyone, even pimply-face youths, can dream of becoming president.</span></p> <p><span>Just take a gander at the Democratic field, which is rife with supposed nonpresidents, especially among the current leaders. Michael S. Dukakis began his career as a local attorney, then became a state legislator, then lieutenant governor, then governor, then governor again and soon...well, who knows? Jesse Jackson was a young civil rights leader in the 1960s. He didn't gain his prominence, even as the leading national Black leader, until he entered the presidential race in 1984. And let us not forget that Richard Gephardt is after all a simple congressman representing a portion of St. Louis.</span></p> <p><span>Of course those running for president, no matter how much they try to convince the voters, don't consider themselves to be regular Joes. In fact, they develop a messiah complex. How could they not? The candidates spend a year listening to their own voice listing the reasons they, and no one else, should be president. No doubt they convince themselves, if no one else. But then a president doesn't need to be a messiah; he or she just has to be a responsible human. And perhaps once we have realized that, we will start voting with our minds and not our hearts.</span></p>"}

{"title": "A Calculated Increase | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b> BANDONING its fruitless attempts to slash federal student financial aid programs, the Reagan Administration this month submitted its proposed education budget for Fiscal Year 1989. Calling for $21.2 billion in federal funding for education and for nearly $9 billion for financial aid programs, this year's budget request finally falls in line with spending levels supported by Congress.</span></p> <p><span>The Administration's proposed budget is most extraordinary when compared with last year's, which called for a 45 percent cut in financial aid. Important programs such as Pell grants and College Work-Study--both vital for low-income students--Will no longer be victim to attack by the White House.</span></p> <p><span>What's to account for such a significant departure from the Administration's highly controversial policy of attempting to slash funds for financial aid whenever it could? Education Department officials admit that one factor is their desire to gain more influence on Capitol Hill. In previous years, when Education Secretary William J. Bennett sought massive cuts in student financial aid, Congress would simply ignore his requests and gave the Reagan Administration no say. As Loye W. Miller, Bennett's press secretary, admitted, \"when you have a budget that is so unpopular that even key Republicans ignore it, then you simply don't have influence and are not a player.\"</span></p> <p><span>However, election-year politics had as much to do with the new budget request as the desire to establish credibility with Congress. Vice President Bush has lobbied hard for education increases, hoping they will translate into better showings in the polls. Republican candidates who once had to justify the administration's aid cuts can now breathe a deep sigh of relief.</span></p> <p><span>Although the new budget request is a refreshing change from the Administration's past policy, the motives are suspect. This is a crucial time in the nation's future, when education is critical for restoring America's economic health. And with progress on civil rights and fighting poverty stalled, the federal government must provide aid for all low-income and minority students to ensure them equal access to college and jobs. With so much at stake, a college education should not have to rely on the political calculations of presidential candidates.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Smoking: Policy and Politics | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last March the Cambridge City Council passed an ordinance prohibiting smoking in all public buildings, but church bingo players and area bowling teams are among a few select groups exempt from the law. At least one Harvard researcher, who is studying the social effects of the ordinance, is trying to find out why.</span></p> <p><span>Littauer Professor of Political Economy Thomas C. Schelling has quit smoking four times, and now, as director of the Kennedy School's Institute for the Study of Smoking Behavior and Policy, Schelling has been working to understand how smoking laws affect people's willingness to quit the tobacco habit, as well as learn why people start and stop smoking in the first place.</span></p> <p><span><b>Cambridge Reaction</b></span></p> <p><span>\"Before the [Cambridge] law went into effect we called up people in Cambridge, and then we called them three months after it went into effect to see how the law had affected them. What we found was that there was a significant [environmental] difference in the workplaces and in public places. Surely if you go into a barber shop or museum, smoking is restricted,\" Schelling says.</span></p> <p><span>\"We also talked to one large corporation headquarters in Cambridge. They had a hard time coming into compliance,\" says Schelling, who has been the only director of the four-year old Institute.</span></p> <p><span>\"The difficulties are that in a large corporation with different buildings it's hard to decide who enforces the law. Will it be the personnel head or the leader of health safety? And it's difficult to cope with union employees who see smoking as something that comes under collective bargaining,\" says Schelling, who also studies climate change, behavioral analysis and national security affairs.</span></p> <p><span>Schelling says he has noticed that many company employees who previously smoked only at work have now quit completely as they do not like the idea of going outdoors or into a room reserved for smokers.</span></p> <p><span>\"Also we are trying to find ways to help people who want to quit by bringing in a therapist to the company or by giving them money to go to a hypnotist or someone who can help them,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Schelling noted that the Cambridge city councilors did not plan the anti-smoking ordinance as carefully as they could have.</span></p> <p><span>\"They made an exception for church bingo and allowed the players to smoke. But they forgot about Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Wherever there is psychotherapy involved it's hard not to let people smoke,\" Schelling says.</span></p> <p><span>Cutting out smoking in bowling alleys has presented problems, as well. Cambridge \"has since had to make an exception for bowling alleys, too. Those places make their money from teams. If one member of a team smokes and can't at the alley, he might hurt the chances of his team's victory; so, they can just go across the river to Brighton. [The smoking policy] was hurting the local alleys,\" Schelling says.</span></p> <p><span>Some merchandisers are glad to see the smoking ordinance in effect. \"The existence of the ordinance is a great excuse for people who like to ban smoking. Take a jeweler, for instance. He doesn't want smoke on the jewels, but he doesn't want to ask someone to put out a cigarrette because they might leave. This way they can blame it on the city,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Since cities have begun implementing antismoking policies, the number of smokers has gone down, according to Schelling, who teaches courses at both the K-School and the College.</span></p> <p><span>\"The progress is really phenomenal,\" he says. \"It really isn't that the federal government or the states have done anything--until the past two years. But the cities have, and now half of all men who smoked have quit. And two-fifths of the women who smoked have quit, too.</span></p> <p><span>\"Essentially our research tells us [smoking] is becoming lower class behavior. Blue collar people smoke more than white collar,\" says Schelling, who received his Ph.D. in economics at Harvard in 1951.</span></p> <p><span><b>Lapsing Into Relapse</b></span></p> <p><span>\"One of the big things we study is relapse,\" Schelling says. \"Everybody's got the word that smoking is bad, and all sorts of people are trying to quit. But if you do relapse, how do you recoup your morale and do it again? That's what we want to figure out.\"</span></p> <p><span>To determine the relapse rate of quitting smokers, Schelling and his assistants, Jan L. Hitchcock, Nancy A. Rigotti and Andrea M. Berman, surveyed a sample of smokers in the Boston area.</span></p> <p><span>\"I called several hundred smokers to see if there are patterns with which people return to smoking if they have quit. Are there multiple attempts to quit? Do they just smoke on and off?\" says Hitchcock, whose special interest is studying how smoking patterns have changed thoughout history.</span></p> <p><span>\"What we found was that there is substantial variation. The person's initial motivation to quit will determine the frequency with which they relapse. There is a complexity of problems--it's a very descriptive study,\" says Hitchcock, who used original as well as previously collected data to support her work.</span></p> <p><span><b>Public Policy</b></span></p> <p><span>Schelling says that the success of Cambridge's anti-smoking policy will lead to more states passing laws governing smoking, and he is now conducting policy studies at the K-School to prepare for such a trend.</span></p> <p><span>\"I belive we have been very influential on policy,\" he says. \"A Kennedy School student did a study for the Massachusetts Commission on Health to see what to do in state areas [about smoking policy]. It went straight to [Gov. Michael S.] Dukakis, and now it has been implemented.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"We were also influential in keeping the 16 cent cigarrette tax the same and not cut back in half to eight cents,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Schelling says the Institute will continue to shape policy as long as it maintains research activities and holds conferences to make congressmen and other policy makers informed of the advances in smoking policy.</span></p> <p><span>\"We are not a lobbying group,\" though, says Hitchcock. \"We just want to show people what the options are in quitting. The general idea, except among the tobacco industry, is that smoking is bad for your health. We're trying to give people a wide range of topics.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Massachusetts House Passes Health Bill In Precedent-Setting Boost for Dukakis | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>BOSTON--The Massachusetts House, brushing aside Republican attempts to stall debate on Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' universal health care bill, gave initial approval last night to the proposal, which is the first of its kind in the nation.</span></p> <p><span>The Democratic-controlled House endorsed the measure by a 99-53 vote after rejecting an amendment that would have removed the heart of the bill--a requirement for most employers to offer health insurance to their workers by 1992.</span></p> <p><span>House Minority Leader Steven D. Pierce (R.-Hampden) introduced the amendment to drop the mandate, saying small business opposed the requirement despite a provision in the bill exempting firms with six employees or less.</span></p> <p><span>Small businesses were opposed \"not because they don't believe that health coverage is important to the people who work for them,\" Pierce said, \"but because they believe they should have the right...to work out that choice based on [their] fiscal constraints.\"</span></p> <p><span>But when House Ways and Means chairman Richard Voke (D.-Chelsea) rose to speak, the stage was set for the critical vote. \"This is the whole enchilada,\" he said. \"If you take [the mandate] out, this is it.\"</span></p> <p><span>The House's Democratic majority responded, defeating the amendment 86-66. Immediately afterward, the House tentatively endorsed the whole bill 99-53. Another vote will be needed in the House, which meets in formal session today, before the measure can move to the Senate.</span></p> <p><span>Passage in the House, which scuttled Dukakis' health care bill in the 1987 session, is the key hurdle for the measure. Late in the 1987 session the Senate passed a bill similar to the one now before the House.</span></p> <p><span>Earlier in the day, Republican State Committee Chairman Ray Shamie and Dukakis exchanged broadsides over the swift schedule the Democratic leadership had plotted for the bill's consideration.</span></p> <p><span>But House Speaker George Keverian (D.-Everett) quelled calls for postponement when he took the podium for a rare floor speech and announced, \"I want this bill to pass. I want this week to be one we remember as long as we live--one in which we faced the challenge and won.\"</span></p> <p><span>Shamie charged before the debate began that the Democratic leadership had put the bill on a fast track to help Dukakis' presidential campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\"No one knows how much this bill will cost,\" Shamie told a news conference. \"But Mike Dukakis knows it will help his presidential campaign.\"</span></p> <p><span>Republicans contend House leaders want to pass the bill in time to give Dukakis a boost for the \"Super Tuesday\" presidential caucuses and primaries in 20 states next week.</span></p> <p><span>Shamie said more time was needed to study the bill. If that time wasn't granted, the Republicans threatened to run radio ads before the November election claiming, \"The Legislature rammed the bill through so Mike Dukakis would have something to crow about in his quest for the White House.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't know that the Republican Party in this state has had a constructive idea in years, and this is another example of it,\" Dukakis fired back when asked about Shamie's comments. \"It's one of the reasons why the Republican Party in this state is in such terrible shape.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis said it was immaterial whether the bill passed before Super Tuesday. \"I have no particular interest in whether or not this bill does or doesn't make it to my desk in the next week,\" he said, adding his only concern is getting \"the best possible bill.\"</span></p> <p><span>The governor said his main concern is passing legislation that would provide health insurance protection for the 600,000 people currently without such coverage in the state.</span></p> <p><span>\"Is there any evidence that the Republican Party in this state and its leadership care about this or has an alternative?

Reagan helped changed that.</span></p> <p><span>But if Reagan extended his hand to the party's social conservatives, these party leaders say, the party's new task is to diversify itself--and George Bush is the man to do it.</span></p> <p><span>Pierre DuPont, who sought the GOP presidential nomination before bowing out this spring, said that people with opposing views can still fit in the GOP. \"There's room in this party for everyone,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>The Reagan coalition included Republicans and conservative Democrats, white ethnic voters, Hispanics--especially Cubans--and evangelicals. But for the most part, Blacks did not participate in the Reagan Revolution.

Bush has spoken to the NAACP, and sent Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.) to the Urban League's annual conference. He invited Coretta Scott King to the convention, and she sat with the vice president's wife. Benjamin Hooks, the NAACP's executive director, spoke from the GOP podium--in prime time--and Black Republicans from Maryland Senate candidate Alan Keyes '72 to former Transportation Secretary William Coleman were presented to the nation.</span></p> <p><span>The key word on Tuesday was \"inclusion.\" Keynote speaker Gov.

Kean called these tactics divisive and pledged that Republicans \"will not divide people, we will bring America together.\"</span></p> <p><span>DuPont said that \"more and more Black Americans are beginning to recognize that they receive tokenism from the Democratic party.\" DuPont even went so far as to suggest that the Rev. Jesse Jackson become a Republican. \"He's pretty good at pointing out the need. We Republicans are awfully good at providing some solutions to those needs.\"</span></p> <p><span>And the convention hall erupted when Jack Kemp said. \"If we do our job right, I predict that by 1992--the start of George Bush's second term--one-quarter of our party will consist of Black, Hispanic and Asian-Americans, who will see in our party the best hope of a better life for themselves and their families.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bush has already begun to distance himself from some of Reagan's more conservative positions, and party leaders expect him to show concern about the environment and education in a way that the party's right wing never has.</span></p> <p><span>But Bush's support for inclusion does not please all Republicans.

Or that Jesse Jackson has a half-brother who is mixed up with drug dealers, murderers and terrorists? Or that the destruction of Barbara Bush's entire wardrobe of silk lingerie while her husband was in the navy \"really got to her\"? Or that Al Gore's candidacy \"raised the possibility of a man going through a mid-life crisis while in the White House\"?</span></p> <p><span>Gail Sheehy seems to think so, and her recently-released <i>Character: America's Search for Leadership</i> proceeds from this assumption. Responding to many Americans, even certain members of the media, who believed that the press had gone too far in reporting the Gary Hart scandal of last year and had shown unmatched arrogance and overzealous tenacity in the process, Sheehy argues that understanding a candidate's character strengths and weaknesses is indispensible for understanding the candidate himself.</span></p> <p><span>Never mind a candidate's stand on the issues, Sheehy warns us. After all, she argues, the issues have become increasingly diffuse, \"too complicated to submit to clever political slogans.\" The parties have become virtually interchangeable. The candidates themselves are often big on rhetoric but thin on specifics, preferring instead to stake out popular, non-controversial positions (opposing new taxes and \"big government\" while supporting patriotism, \"good jobs at good wages\", and a \"war on drugs\").</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, Sheehy astutely but unoriginally points out, some of our most recent presidents have been victimized not by bad policies, but by dangerous \"character flaws.\" Richard Nixon's downfall was not Watergate, the argument goes, but his own feeling of paranoia that led him to order the break-ins. Likewise, Reagan's downfall was not the Iran-contra scandal in itself, but rather his inattention to detail and his willingness to delegate responsibility to zealots like Oliver North.</span></p> <p><span>In <i>Character,</i> Sheehy makes a hardly novel argument that the characters of each of these six presidential candidates and of Reagan are the result of a single event or individual that had a profound impact on the candidate's development. The devastating injuries which Bob Dole received during his service in World War II have produced his \"dark side,\" his insistence on self-reliance, and his often bitter sense of humor. Jesse Jackson's character and drive were nourished in the subculture of the segregated black South, and his insatiable quest for legitimacy and respect are the product of having been born out of wedlock and constantly being reminded of that fact in his youth. Likewise, Al Gore Jr.'s precociousness comes from his overwhelming desire to do twice as well as expected, so as not to be seen as coasting on his father's coattails.</span></p> <p><span><b>Y</b>ET Sheehy borders on the implausible when she suggests that George Bush submitted to Reagan as his father figure in the same manner as he had submitted to his authoritarian father as a youth or that Gary Hart, whom she compares to Gatsby, is unable to \"search out a middle path between Nazarene perfection and Beatty-esque amorality.\" Too often, Sheehy's ruins a well-written chapter with such pop psychology.</span></p> <p><span>Sheehy does occasionally put her thorough reporting skills to good use, producing some well-written chapters about the so-called \"character flaws\" of the candidates. Her opening chapters on Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson are incredibly damning, but she then settles down to portray Dole, Gore and Dukakis in a largely favorable light.</span></p> <p><span>Which leads one to ask what exactly Sheehy's purpose is. Is it to expose the character flaws in our candidates so as to ensure that, heaven forbid, Jackson or Bush won't make it to the White House? Is it to set forth any coherent idea as to what constitutes \"presidential\" character? Is it to explore what unique characteristics propel one individual to seek the nation's highest office, while the rest of us demur?</span></p> <p><span>Or is it more of a therapeutic plan, in effect saying to the American people, \"Our past four elected presidents and this year's crop of candidates have gone as far as they have with serious 'character flaws', so don't worry if you have any\"?</span></p> <p><span><b>U</b>NFORTUNATELY, it's none of these. For what's most troubling about <i>Character</i> is Sheehy's cynical mindset, namely the assumption that today's candidates are inherently lying, pandering and manipulative bastards, trying to con the living daylights out of those malleable voters. Therefore, this self-serving mindset continues, voters should wise up, ignore what the candidates are saying, and treat what an \"enlightened\" few in the press say about them as gospel.</span></p> <p><span>Just because today's issues may be more \"diffuse\" than in the past and can't be as easily reduced to three-word political slogans doesn't mean that we should ignore what the candidates are saying on AIDS or the budget deficit and focus exclusively on Jackson's apparent meglomania, Dole's \"darkness\" or Dukakis' stubborness. If Sheehy really wants someone with a \"flawless character\" like Ozzie Nelson or Ward Cleaver to run for president (which is the impression she gives), why doesn't she just say so?</span></p> <p><span>So the next time you hear Tom Brokaw or David Brinkley accusing the candidates of being shallow and vague on the issues and of not providing realistic solutions to the deficit, think about Gail Sheehy and the premium (or lack thereof) she seems to put on important policy questions.</span></p>"}

Politicians talk of equality for all Americans, whether they be white, Black, yellow, red or brown. It's a type of political rhetoric politicians love to use.

It would have created a stir if Bush was referring to the entire Hispanic community, and if he showed a desire to offend Hispanics.

Bush, of course, didn't say this. Yet that is exactly what many of Democratic opponents wish the incident with his three grandchildren would become.</span></p> <p><span>The Democrats would have a field day: \"George Bush, the man who thinks his Mexican-American children are illegal aliens. Is this the type of family man you want in the White House? Vote Dukakis '88.\"</span></p> <p><span>But if it would be crass for the Democrats to blow Bush's comment out of proportion by labeling it as an offensive one, it would be simply responsible for them to criticize Bush's own awkward attempts to lure Hispanic voters to the Republican party.</span></p> <p><span>They could point to the fact that Bush will use his son Jeb's family, who are all bilingual, to attract the Hispanic vote. Bush has created a liasion between himself and the nation's Hispanics, through his grandchildren and his daughter-in-law. He could not talk to them directly since he doesn't know Spanish, so he will use other members of his family to relay his message.</span></p> <p><span>George Bush cannot identify with the Hispanic vote, no matter how hard he tries. He once told Hispanic Republicans in Texas that he regretted not learning to speak Spanish. Why didn't he ever make an effort to do so when he was a congressman from Texas, where a large number of Hispanics live?</span></p> <p><span>The vice president also thinks that his promise to appoint a Hispanic to his cabinet will attract Hispanic voters. But it's a question of dessert before the dinner. Bush must still address why Hispanics still suffer from poverty and unemployment in a nation that according to President Reagan, prospers from low unemployment and lower interest rates.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>USH certainly doesn't come from a background to which Hispanics can relate. But all of a sudden, Bush sees the need to attract the Hispanic voter. He can't do it on his background. He probably can't do it on the past eight years of the Reagan Administration. So he turns to Jeb and his wife and the kids.</span></p> <p><span>But Jeb and his wife and kids are not running for president. It is Bush himself who must say that he sincerely relates to the problems of the Hispanic community in the United States.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis, on the other hand, can identify with Hispanics just on the sole reason that he spoke Spanish, and very fluent Spanish, at the Democratic Convention. Dukakis can go out and directly talk to Hispanic voters without anyone having to translate for him. He can talk about his background as the son of an immigrant family and Hispanics will relate to him more than Bush.</span></p> <p><span>What Hispanics see in Dukakis is what Bush lacks: sincerity. Dukakis has made a symbolic attempt at the Convention to speak to Hispanics in their native tongue that will most likely result in Hispanics voting Democratic in November.</span></p> <p><span>Bush will need more than Jeb and his wife and kids to attract the Hispanic vote. He will have to prove to the Hispanic community that he will help improve its overall situation in American society. But if he continues to be as awkward as he was in describing his own grandchildren, the nation's Hispanics will keep talking in Spanish while George stumbles along in English.</span></p>"}

Kerry (D-Mass.), is taking another shot at the senior senator from Massachusetts, and Malone maintains Kennedy can be beaten.</span></p> <p><span>\"Forty percent of the people in Massachusetts will always vote for Senator Kennedy, there's another 40 percent that will never vote for him,\" Malomne says. \"That leaves 20 percent to work with in the middle, and I'm getting a great response.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"[Kennedy's] almost taking this election for granted,\" Malone said. \"Even Tip O'Neill says you can't take voters for granted--you have to ask them for your support.\"</span></p> <p><span>And if that means visiting every grange hall and veterans group in the Commonwealth, Malone says he is up to the challenge. \"There's an opportunity to make a difference every day,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Malone is convinced that Kennedy's visibility and high name recognition is beneficial to the Republican's own campaign. \"The fact that Ted Kennedy's image is so set in people's minds allows me to talk more about Joe Malone than having to educate and inform them about Ted Kennedy,\" Malone says. \"I don't have to spend a half-a-million dollars to let the voters of Massachusetts know that Ted Kennedy is an ultraliberal--they know it already.\"</span></p> <p><span>If Malone is right, Kennedy has won re-election in the past not because people share his ideology, but because they share a \"cultural bond to the Democratic party.\" This time, Malone says voters will back him because, \"I'm the first generation candidate, I'm the one from Waltham, I'm the one who understands the concerns of working men and women. Ted Kennedy's out of touch with those people.\"</span></p> <p><span>With a son of Brookline, Massachusetts running for president, turnout on election day should be high. But Malone says he can win even if Bush loses.</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't see there being any great coattail effect that Mike Dukakis is going to provide for Ted Kennedy,\" Malone says, noting that a Republican was elected governor of Massachusetts in 1960, with John F. Kennedy '40 heading the Democratic ticket.</span></p> <p><span>\"And Jack Kennedy was a heck of a lot more popular than Mike Dukakis is,\" Malone adds.</span></p> <p><span>Malone says he has already raised $200,000, and predicts he'll raise and spend at least $1 million by election day. He expects Kennedy to spend as much as twice that amount.</span></p> <p><span>Malone says Kennedy raised a lot of money, hoping to frighten away any competition, because he is uncomfortable \"working crowds, standing at factory gates and asking people for their support.

{"title": "The Surprising Choice | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HIS was supposed to have been the week Vice President George Bush stepped out from President Reagan's shadow and got his chance to \"define\" himself to the millions of voters who still honestly don't know what he stands for.</span></p> <p><span>Yet all the selection of Sen. Dan Quayle (R-Indiana) as his running mate does is to highlight the vice president's glaring weaknesses as a candidate. The pick was a foolish one that has Democrats celebrating and many Republicans muttering under their breath in disgust.</span></p> <p><span>Quayle's limited assets, in no particular order, seem to be his youth and good looks, as well as his conservative credentials. Those few party officials who honestly support the choice say that Quayle has shorn up conservative support for the vice president and are boldly predicting that he will reduce the so-called \"gender gap\", bring in the Baby Boom vote for the Republicans, and give Bush a much-needed boost in the Midwest.</span></p> <p><span>Yet the only one of these predictions that is likely to be true is the first one, and ensuring conservative support for the ticket should have been the least of Bush's worries in picking his running mate.</span></p> <p><span>The second assumption (namely, that women will now vote for Bush because he's got a handsome running mate), which was clearly involved in the decision since Bush trails so badly among women voters, is not only incredibly insulting to women, but doesn't make logical sense. After all, by that logic, Geraldine Ferraro (or Meryl Streep) would have closed the gap among male voters for Walter Mondale in 1984 And it's not like Quayle has a popular record to go along with his pretty face: he's staunchly opposed to the ERA, comparable worth and parental leave.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE idea that Quayle is suddenly going to deliver the youth vote to Bush is unlikely as well. The so-called Baby Boom generation is an incredibly diverse one which, like most other generations, does not vote as a monolithic bloc. None of this year's likely Baby Boomer presidential candidates (Gary Hart or Joe Biden) went anywhere, as voters were quick to recognize that, like Quayle, these two candidates were all style and very little substance.</span></p> <p><span>Geographically, the pick makes no sense. Quayle will help Bush win in the Midwest? He's barely known outside of Indiana. Bob Dole, on account of his popularity and his record of service to that region, would have been a far better pick to shore up Bush's lagging support in the farm states. Moreover, Quayle doesn't bring Bush a crucial state and is unlikely to help him in the South. And his opposition to the plant closing notification is unlikely to endear him to the heavily industrial states of that region of the country as well.</span></p> <p><span>As a symbol, Quayle merely reinforces the public perception of the Republican Party (and of Bush himself) as the party of the well-to-do. As an heir to a nationwide publishing network whose net worth is estimated at $200 million, Quayle certainly isn't likely to help Bush convince blue-collar workers and Reagan Democrats that the ticket represents the concerns of the working men and women of this country.</span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>OREOVER, as much as Bush's supporters may try to deny this, Quayle is no match for his Democratic counter-part, Lloyd Bentsen, in intelligence, leadership, experience or qualifications for the presidency. He is widely considered by congressional colleagues on both sides of the aisle as a lightweight, a nice guy with a pretty face but with virtually no substantive achievements in his 12 years in Congress. During a dinner for top Republican officials earlier this week, the main topic of conversation was who would be Bush's pick as a running mate. When Quayle's name was mentioned, many in the group could barely conceal their amusement.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, if emerging reports that Quayle's wealthy family may have helped to get him out of the Vietnam War are proven true, Quayle will soon be off the ticket, and for good reason. After all, it's awfully easy to proclaim your support for an aggressive, intervientionist foreign policy when your Dad helped buy your way out of military service.</span></p> <p><span>Praising the vice president's choice on national TV the other night, one Republican strategist said that Bush's decision reflected his desire to \"be his own man\" and not be overshadowed by a well-known running mate. Indeed, Quayle is sure to play the groveling loyal and unquestioning vice president that Bush has been all along. But while the vice president may seem wiser, more mature and more self-assured in comparison with Quayle, who seems nervous and overwhelmed by the spotlight now shining on him, Bush's judgment remains questionable.</span></p> <p><span>It certainly suggests that Bush does not have much respect for the office of vice presidency, a position he has held now for eight years, by selecting some one who has clearly not proven himself qualified to be the proverbial \"heartbeat away\" from the presidency. And it makes you wonder when Bush ignores the pleadings of seasoned political pros like James Baker and follows the advice of his media advisers that Quayle, if not the most competent, would make the most telegenic running mate.</span></p> <p><span>It's already clear that the selection of Quayle was a poorly-thought-out, desperate move by a candidate who realizes he's in serious trouble. By selecting a lightweight who is clearly not ready for the rigors of a national campaign, Bush has lost a crucial opportunity to convince American voters to support his candidacy. He has implicitly insulted millions of American women and has added nothing but a pretty face with a paltry record to his ticket.</span></p>"}

In a sense, an entire generation of political leaders was gunned down.</span></p> <p><span>But if their heroes were murdered, the Baby Boomers themselves seem bent on commiting political suicide, and Sen. J. Danforth Quayle, Vice President George Bush's running mate in the run for the White House, is but the latest casualty.</span></p> <p><span>The 1988 election was meant to mark the coming of age of the Baby Boomers. On the Democratic side, Senators Jospeh Biden and Gary Hart both ran as candidates who could relate to the post-World War II generation, and just as JFK noted that a torch had been passed to a new generation, Hart and Biden maintained that they were now carrying a new torch.</span></p> <p><span>Political analysts noted that hardly a stump speech was offered by the Baby Boomers without an allusion to the Kennedys. But simultaneously, they questioned whether there was anything at the core of the Baby Boomers beyond some faint hope of tapping into the legacy of their fallen heroes.</span></p> <p><span>But doubts about experience and substance which plague any newcomer to national politics soon became serious questions of character. It's one thing to be young; it's quite another to be young and foolish and running for the presidency.</span></p> <p><span><b>G</b>ARY Hart became the first victim. The revelation that he had spent the night with a Florida model, Donna Rice, proved so damaging as to end Hart's campaign even though he was the clear front-runner at the time.</span></p> <p><span>The historian Alan Brinkley noted in <i>The New York Times</i> that Hart's down fall stemmed from the simple fact that he had no following, no deep-rooted constituency, in short, no claim to be running for the White House other than his own ambition.</span></p> <p><span>In the end, Gary Hart became a political ghost at a tender age. He tried to make a comeback and instead became a laughingstock and an embarrassment to his party.</span></p> <p><span>Biden was the next of the Baby Boomers to go. An \"attack video\" was released which indicated that Biden was not altogether clear what were the words and ideas of his predecessors and what were his own. The problem became fatal when it was revealed that the Delaware senator had cheated as a student at Syracuse Law School.</span></p> <p><span>Douglas Ginsburg was a Baby Boomer of sorts himself, and though not a political candidate, he would have been the first of his generation to have become a Supreme Court justice. But he too fell victim to the same pattern. It began with questions about his competence: What scholarship had he really done? How many cases had he ever argued? Had he proved himself as a legal mind worthy of the Court? Soon it mushroomed into questions about his character, with the final blow being the revelation that he smoked marijuana while a Harvard law professor.</span></p> <p><span>Dan Quayle, then, is merely the latest of the Baby Boomers who has fallen victim to the age factor. From the moment of his selection, the two reactions to youth which are inevitable came forth. He is young and exciting--it was said--vigorous and attractive, a great campaigner with amazing energy. He is a bright young star, who is charismatic and represents the future. And then there were the doubts. His name became an interrogative. Dan Quayle? Who is Dan Quayle?</span></p> <p><span>He had a limited record in Congress and when pressed to prove his credentials he was forced to list summer internships he held while still a student. On his first day on the stump as a vice presidential candidate. Quayle seemed overwhelmed, jumpy, amateurish.</span></p> <p><span><b>Y</b>OUTH is by definition a Janus-faced attribute, and he would likely have not suffered greatly had it been that he was only young. But in no time at all, questions about his substance as a political figure turned into questions about his personal character, and the combination is politically life-threatening.</span></p> <p><span>First there is the matter of his weekend in Florida with lobbyist Paula Parkinson, who claims to have had affairs with several Republican lawmarkers. All evidence indicates that Quayle did nothing improper. The same is not clear in regard to his military record. Rather than going to Vietnam in 1969, Quayle signed up with the Indiana National Guard. Recent reports suggest that he used his family's influence to have his name bumped up on the list so that the Guard would take him and he would not have to see combat duty.</span></p> <p><span>What is troubling is that for men of such young ages, who have had so little time to accomplish much of anything, they all seem to have found plenty of time to become entangled in personally embarrassing episodes. It is not fair to expect that someone who is not yet a half-century old will have a long and distinguished record of public service. And by and large the public is charitable on that score.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>NEXPERIENCE in the young is forgiven in much the same way that past transgressions are often overlooked in the old. In a long life, the likelihood of making a misstatement, having a bad idea or suffering a lapse of judgement is high. If blemishes are discovered, we check to see if they have been corrected and, so long as there is a long list of counter-balancing accomplishments, we forgive.</span></p> <p><span>The recent challenges to George Bush's war record are perhaps the best example of this phenomenon. It was suggested that Bush had exaggerated his heroic exploits in World War II, but it was forgiven in part because the event in question occurred more than 40 years ago, and in part because Bush was in the navy, did fly several combat missions and has over his long tenure of public service proved himself to be, if nothing else, honest.</span></p> <p><span>A younger candidate does not have such benefits.</span></p> <p><span>But so far the Baby Boom generation's leading lights have not been able to understand the bargain the public makes with age. They exaggerate their own accompishments, as Quayle has done in suggessting that he is unrivalled in his knowledge of national defense policy or Hart did in proclaiming himself a candidate with ideas. And they are vindictive and defensive when questioned about past improprieties, not understanding that a short resume requires a clean character.</span></p>"}

Noting its reluctance to create new laws, rights or privileges, the court said the issue was a policy question best left to the legislature.</span></p> <p><span>The case before the court had its beginnings in 1985, when the Dukakis administration abruptly removed two youngsters--then aged 3 and 22 months--from Babets and Jean, a homosexual couple living in Boston.</span></p> <p><span>After a study, the Department of Social Services promulgated new rules laying out a system of priorities for placing foster children that gave lowest priority to gay individuals who lacked experience as parents.

Gen. Augusto Pinochet has ruled since 1973.

Fifteen years later, Pinochet still rules and maintains \"order\" in Chile.

But that fact alone is enough to convince the Reagan Administration that this Central American nation about the size of Arkansas threatens the security of the United States. It is this threat that makes Reagan push for more contra aid. Yet at the same time, he calls peace the final goal in Central America.</span></p> <p><span>Never mind that the United States did not initiate the peace talks of the five Central American nations. That honor went to the Oscar Arias-Sanchez and the Costa Rican government. Instead, the Reagan Administration believes that peace can be achieved only through the funding of more weapons. The peace it really looks for is an end to Ortega.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>F the United States had a choice to replace Ortega with either a right-wing dictator who would restore \"order\" back to Nicaragua or a newly-developed democratic system, it would likely choose the dictator. It did so in El Salvador.</span></p> <p><span>Another contradiction arises in the current case of Mexico. Where was the United States when the elections in Mexico resulted in charges of fraud by the losing party? Will the U.S. allow the PRI, which has ruled Mexico for nearly six decades, to ignore the charges? So much for the democratic process that supposedly favors the periodic change of political parties.</span></p> <p><span>So much for democracy in all of Latin America.</span></p> <p><span>One-party rule in Mexico or one-man rule in Chile benefits the United States more than an open, democratic system because the U.S. would rather have order in Mexico City and Santiago than chaos in both cities.</span></p> <p><span>Such a policy will never change, as long as the United States sees Latin America as a group of nations unable to achieve any semblance of government without some form of American intervention.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HY should the United States be concerned with democracy in Latin America? Maybe because the United States views itself as the world's defender of democracy. Maybe because the United States is the symbol of democracy that many Latin American nations long to be. But when it comes to Latin America, the United States does not defend democracy, it distorts it for its own interests.</span></p> <p><span>What then can Latin American nations do? Imposing a anti-drug policy might keep U.S. support alive, both diplomatically and financially. Yet the time has come for Latin American nations to control their own destiny, especially in terms of achieveing democracy.

The school has moved sharply to the left in the past 40 years, however. Schlafly says Harvard's professors are now out of step with the nation. \"There are so many liberals.

Schlafly says Americans don't want to endorse what she calls the \"hidden agenda\" of ERA activists. If passed, the law will be used to mandate \"taxpayer-funded abortions and gay rights,\" she said.</span></p> <p><span>She is, to say the least, a member of the Republican party's right-wing, a wing which has already suggested that it doesn't plan to stay quiet during this week's GOP convention.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>RIGINALLY a supporter of Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.), Schlafly is now a staunch Bush-backer. \"Liberal Democrats are for higher taxes so federal bureaucrats can decide what we do and spend our money. Under George Bush's philosophy, we'll clearly get to spend more of our own money,\" she said.</span></p> <p><span>For years, Schlafly has battled the liberals--even Republican liberals. In the 1960s, Schlafly was an outspoken critic of Rockefeller Republicans and the Eastern Establishment which once dominated the party. Schlafly was one of the women the press dubbed \"little old ladies in tennis shoes\" who helped guide Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater to the Republican nomination in 1964.</span></p> <p><span>After Goldwater's landslide loss to Lyndon Johnson, Schlafly looked to another conservative to help solve \"the mess in Washington.\" And after seven-and-a-half years at the helm, Reagan hasn't disappointed this homemaker. \"I'm terribly pleased with Reagan. I think he's the greatest thing of this century,\" Schlafly said.</span></p> <p><span>She credits Reagan with restoring the country's economy and its self-respect. Reagan \"gave this country a new confidence....He believed in American and in our future and he conveyed that to the American people.\"</span></p> <p><span>Having slain the ERA, Schlafly is now taking on new dragons. She heads the Eagle Forum, a conservative women's political group with 80,000 members and she's working on \"about a dozen political issues right now, including the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and educational issues.</span></p> <p><span>She'll also be working to keep Gov. Michael S. Dukakis out of the White House. Noting Dukakis' one-time support for prison furlough programs, Schlafly scoffs at the notion that the Duke can win by stressing competence and playing down ideology. \"If he wants to fight on competence, I think he's going to come out the loser on that,\" she predicts.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>OME Bush supporters are worried about the \"gender gap,\" which shows women favoring Dukakis by a wider margin than men. Schlafly stresses that the Democrats have a gender gap of their own. \"George Bush appeals to men,\" she maintains. The Texan stands for economic freedom and low taxes and will guarantee economic prosperity, Schlafly says.</span></p> <p><span>Bush currently trails Dukakis by up to 18 points in some national polls, a fact that frightens some Republican strategists. To add excitement to the campaign and to woo women voters, some Republicans are suggesting that Bush pick women as his running mate: perhaps former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Kansas Senator Nancy Kassebaum or former United Nations Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick.</span></p> <p><span>Schlafly isn't rooting for a female running mate in '88--she wants to see Kemp on the ticket instead. \"I don't see one woman who would add significantly to the vote total, and I think Jack Kemp would add significantly,\" she said.</span></p> <p><span>A loyal Catholic and a mother of six, Schlafly is an outspoken critic of <i>Roe vs. Wade,</i> the Supreme Court decision which threw out all anti-abortion laws and mandated abortion-on-demand. But, unlike New Hampshire Senator Gordon Humphrey, she isn't bothered that some prominent pro-choice Republicans are being given high-profile speaking slots at the convention. \"I'm very tolerant. It's okay with me if people who are for abortion support George Bush: it's not going to affect George Bush's positions [on abortion], however,\" Schlafly said.</span></p> <p><span>Schlafly knows what she is talking about, for she is a homemaker who has convinced many to change their positions.</span></p>"}

Stone which boasted of the company's influence inside the administration and listed more than a dozen contacts in Bush's office.</span></p> <p><span>The firm received $800,000 in 1985 and 1986 from the Bahamian government. The Bahamian prime minister, Lynden O.

In a Dukakis White House, there will be no back doors for foreign lobbyists.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis referred to other campaign aides who reportedly have been sympathetic to Nazis and Nazi organizations, including Jerome Brentar, who resigned as co-chairman of a Bush campaign organization for ethnic groups when it was disclosed that he once defended convicted Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think it says a great deal about that campaign,\" Dukakis said. \"It says a great deal about the judgment of Mr. Bush.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis also twitted Bush Business president of the Senate for never proposing that senators recite the Pledge of Allegiance as part of their legislative business.</span></p> <p><span>That comment, and his reference to pledging allegiance to only one flag, was the nominee's response to Bush's frequent criticism of Dukakis for vetoing a state bill aimed at requiring public school teachers to lead their classes in reciting the pledge. Dukakis says he was advised that the bill was unconstitutional.</span></p> <p><span>Bentsen toured the Los Angeles Country Sheriff's \"Operation Safe Streets\" program in the Carson area, a major site of violent gang activities, and took the occasion to blast Bush's role in the administration's anti-drug campaign.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Sticker Campaign Seen As Long Shot | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Cambridge political lore is rich with stories about former Speaker of the House Thomas P. \"Tip\" O'Neill, and one of the favorites describes the elderly woman who didn't vote on election day. When O'Neill asked her why, she told him, \"People like to be asked, dear.\"</span></p> <p><span>Legislative aides and local politicians have been passing on that advice to Rep. Saundra Graham (D-Cambridge) since last Thursday night. That was when she lost her primary race to relative unknown Alvin P. Thompson by 49 votes.</span></p> <p><span>Graham blamed low turnouts, her own low-key campaigning, and newspaper coverage of drug charges against two of her sons.</span></p> <p><span>Graham announced she would run a \"sticker campaign\" against Thompson in the November general election, when he--for lack of a Republican opponent--will be the only one on the ballot for the 28th Middlesex District House seat. Graham plans to ask supporters to put stickers bearing her name and address on the write-in blanks inside their computer ballots' paper envelopes.</span></p> <p><span>Aides to two state senators who recently ran sticker campaigns said Graham will have to appeal to unusually dedicated voters to win. Not only must voters decide which name to pick, but they must remember the name, bring stickers with them into the voting booths, and put the stickers in the right place on their ballots.</span></p> <p><span>Frank Borges, chief of staff to Sen. Salvatore Albano (D-Somerville), who beat incumbent Vincent J. Piro with a sticker campaign in 1984, thinks Graham has a chance of victory if she works hard.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think it's possible, yes, but I think it's going to take a campaign that doesn't think it's going to win if it prints up 100,000 stickers,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Danny Johnson, chief of staff to Sen. Royal Bolling, Sr. (D-Boston), who lost a sticker campaign Thursday, said, \"Never say never.\" But he added that, like Bolling, Graham has \"not enough time\" to publicize her campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Both agreed that Graham must recruit many volunteers to talk voters into the extra effort of using the stickers.</span></p> <p><span>\"You're going to really have to love a person to go out and do that,\" Johnson said of the district's voters.</span></p> <p><span>As for the candidate's pitch, Borges said, \"You have to say, `I know my name's not on the ballot, but I want you to put it there.' And most people will say, `What? Are you crazy?'\"</span></p> <p><span>At best, said Johnson, the tactic is uncertain. \"You sit around biting your nails,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Graham, who nearly lost her City Council re-election campaign last November, is up against more than voters' ignorance, said Borges.</span></p> <p><span>\"She has to give them a reason to vote for her,\" as well as an argument against Thompson, he said. Thompson, a school department truant officer who formerly served as assistant to the city manager for community relations, campaigned against Graham's attendance record and the fact that she held two public offices at once.</span></p> <p><span>Asked this weekend whether the near-loss last November made her nervous, Graham noted that most liberal voters favored Councillor David E. Sullivan because they thought he was the most threatened of the incumbents they supported. In addition, she said, \"I do have a bloc of solid support that follows me, no matter what.\"</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, Thompson said Graham's plans were her business, but added that none of the presidential nominees ran on stickers against Michael Dukakis, nor would Dukakis wage a sticker campaign against George Bush if he lost in November.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson said the sticker effort for Bolling--who ran such a campaign because he failed to turn in his nomination papers on time--faced several problems: different parts of the district used several different kinds of ballots with different procedures for write-in voting; some voting machines had write-in slots too high for handicapped or elderly voters to reach; and, as in Graham's district, the turnout set record lows at around 15 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Borges said Albano's 1984 campaign risked $25,000 in borrowed money and two months of work for a sticker campaign. Albano opted for a sticker effort in the general election, because he had placed second in a three-way primary--only 163 votes behind the leader, Piro--and because Piro was about to face trial on corruption charges.</span></p> <p><span>The risky undertaking worked--thanks to 75 to 100 nightly volunteers and saturation tactics using the stickers. Albano won by about 2000 votes, not counting around 1000 ballots that the Piro campaign challenged because the stickers were in the wrong place.</span></p> <p><span>Borges said the campaign printed four times as many stickers as probable voters, then delivered them in four ways--once by mail, once in leaflets, once via volunteer on every district doorstep, and once outside the polling places on election day.</span></p> <p><span>\"There are some success stories,\" said Borges, who now advises other candidates on sticker campaigns. But, he added, they are few and far between.</span></p> <p><span>Graham's district includes Adams, Dunster, Leverett and Mather Houses, the freshman Union dorms and Peabody Terrace.</span></p>"}
{"title": "A Paranoid Pledge | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>T is unfortunate and unsettling to hear the vice president of the United States taunting his opponent for vetoing a bill which would require public school teachers to lead their students in the pledge. It is almost comical to see these two candidates falling all over themselves in an effort to salute the flag and place hand upon heart.</span></p> <p><span>But what lies behind the pledge flap is something quite important, something which cannot simply be covered over and tucked away as a trivial low point in Campaign '88.</span></p> <p><span>When John F. Kennedy '40 ran for the White House in 1960, a campaign to which the current candidate from Massachusetts is fond of referring, he was the first Catholic to stand a serious chance of becoming president. It <i>was</i> an issue that he was Catholic. Not because it should have been, or because it was strategically advantageous for his opponents to make it one, but because this nation's history of anti-Catholic sentiment mandated that it be one.</span></p> <p><span>Hatred and fear of others is part of this country. The story of America, if one is willing to accept the myth which may or may not have a grounding in reality, is the story of the triumph of inclusion over prejudice. So Kennedy had no choice but to confront those who feared his Catholicism as he did in West Virginia.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HIS context is vital to understanding the current pledge flap. George Bush--or more likely his advisor, Roger Ailes--is not simply capitalizing on a cheap means of portraying Dukakis as a flaming liberal. He is tugging on the strings of xenophobia which run from coast to coast.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy was the first Catholic; Dukakis is the first ethnic candidate, the first child of immigrants of the late 19th century to attempt to push the parameters of the American dream. Those immigrants experienced prejudice, learning that a last name which sounded foreign brought them abuse more often than a welcoming gesture. But they also, by and large, found that America was open to them, and for the most part they became guardians of the rights of others to become Americans. In short, they were optimists.</span></p> <p><span>The Democratic nominee achieved his zenith in the polls precisely as he was stressing his immigrant story as the motivating force in his life. By taking pride in his immigrant roots, Dukakis appeared as an energetic optimist--as opposed to previous Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>He also found a means of reaching out to other neglected groups. After entering to the strains of Neil Diamond's <i>Coming to America,</i> Dukakis told the convention that whether one came in a slave galley or an immigrant ship, we are all in the same boat together.</span></p> <p><span>But the flip side of the optimism of the immigrants' story is the paranoia that the mass of Americans' harbor toward those who are different. As quickly as they can be stirred by the story of the son of Greek immigrants, they can be frightened when reminded that he is, after all, not named Smith, Jones or even Bush.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>Y raising the specter of the pledge, Bush is not so much demanding that Dukakis prove his loyalty to the flag as he is requiring that Dukakis hide his immigrant roots.</span></p> <p><span>The novelist Philip Roth, who is one of the great chroniclers of what happened to many of those immigrants, observed recently that, by raising the issue of the pledge, Bush \"manages to insinuate that there is something that remains unnaturalized in a man called Dukakis, an ineradicable alienness\" which makes him something other.</span></p> <p><span>You will notice that in recent weeks Dukakis has not mentioned his father too often (the first Greek ever to go to Harvard Medical School), or the pride he takes in his ancestors' homeland, or his favorite Greek expressions.</span></p> <p><span>Before, Dukakis could emphasize his immigrant roots as a way of communicating his message; now, he must begin to hide them so that he may prove his Americanness. The change in his political rhetoric amounts to the equivalent of a name change--from Dukakis to say, Douglas.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis' recent silence has been criticized as a reluctance to fight back. But the very nature of Bush's attack is designed to induce silence. To challenge one's Americanness is to point out one's differences from the mainstream.</span></p> <p><span>The accused quite naturally begins to keep low, talk softly, try not to call much attention to himself. And if the accused does decide to speak out, he affects an odd imitation of his accuser's voice. He begins to love the flag all the more, he may even ride around in a United States Army tank in front of television cameras.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's constant harping on the pledge reminds us that there are still some Americans who, simply by an accident of birth, have great power over others.</span></p> <p><span>The pledge issue is not trivial. It is not fluff. It is about the great gulf which still separates the dream from reality. Such gulfs do not simply pass away over time, they remain deep until they are filled. This year, either the gulf will remain, or as in 1960, a new bridge will be erected.</span></p>"}

Michael Dukakis does not know the difference between being on top of a ticket and leading a party.</span></p> <p><span>The Dukakis of February (the Michael Dukakis of the \"Seven Dwarfs\" primary campaign) is the same as the Michael Dukakis of September. His themes are the same. He is still touting the Massachusetts Miracle. He is still praising competence as opposed to Ronald Reagan's cursed gift: charisma.</span></p> <p><span>He is still offering nothing concrete. No plans. No dreams. Elect me and my competence, he says, and you won't be sorry.</span></p> <p><span>All that has changed about Dukakis is his title. At the beginning of the campaign, he was Michael Dukakis, Democratic candidate. Now he is Michael Dukakis, Democratic nominee.</span></p> <p><span>For a man intent on avoiding the tag \"the next Jimmy Carter,\" Dukakis is acting a great deal like him.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>n 1976, Carter ran in the primaries much as Dukakis did in 1988. Carter set out to avoid any specific plans, hoping that by displeasing no one, he would please everyone.</span></p> <p><span>He had one theme, that of the \"Washington outsider,\" a Christian peanut farmer capable of cleaning up the mess in Washington. He used this theme much as Dukakis is using the Massachusetts Miracle.</span></p> <p><span>He was effective because Washington was a mess. It did need cleaning up. Watergate stunk like a New York subway.</span></p> <p><span>In 1988, there is no great mess. Charisma does not stink. The odors left by Iran-Contra, Pentagon scandals and other Reagan-era problems are mild--sour milk, not rubbish.</span></p> <p><span>Carter could afford to be vague. Dukakis cannot.</span></p> <p><span>In the 1988 election, as in the 1976 election, what is most missing is enthusiasm. How excited can a person get about a debate over the \"Pledge of Allegiance\"?</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis, by bantering with George Bush about this and other soporific issues, is putting his followers asleep. He is leaving them nothing to cheer about, no reason to say, \"I am going to get up on election day and vote for Dukakis because of what he will do about this...\"</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>NE salient example of Dukakis' shortcomings is his dealings with Blacks. He seems to believe that Blacks will vote for him because he is not George Bush. But what makes him so sure that, given his silence on issues important to Blacks (civil rights, for instance), Blacks will vote at all?</span></p> <p><span>Like Carter, Dukakis is trying not to offend. He does not want Jesse Jackson, the runner-up in the primary campaign and the nation's best-know Black politician, to alienate potential white voters and Reagan-Democrats, who might get uncomfortable if Jackson were to have too visible a presence in the Dukakis campaign.</span></p> <p><span>So instead, Dukakis is telling Jackson to go his own way, namely to Black communities. Recently, the Dukakis campaign alloted Jackson and other Black Democratic leaders $5 million of the Dukakis campaign's $50 million budget for a get-out-the-Black-vote drive. Dukakis himself seems intent on remaining out of Black communites lest some white swing voters deem him sympathetic to Black causes.</span></p> <p><span>Although a formidable campaigner, Jackson alone will not be enough to bring Black votes into the Dukakis column. Jackson, Blacks are accutely aware, is not the nominee. He will not be able to change their situations. He will not be able to push though civil rights legislation or new housing acts.</span></p> <p><span><b>D</b>UKAKIS needs to stop believing others will do for him what he needs to do. Dukakis needs to go to Black communities and tell Blacks what he will do to help them, the most obvious example of people who have not been reached by the Reagan revolution.</span></p> <p><span>He showed he was a capable speaker at the Democratic Convention. He needs to bring his speaking skills to people most wanting to heed what he has to say.</span></p> <p><span>If Dukakis maintains his vague approach and still wins--not inconceivable, considering Bush's propensity for shooting himself in the behind--he may well suffer from the same symptoms Carter faced as president.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>OT having stirred people as a campaigner, Carter never won their loyalty. When things did not go right for him as president, people did not back him up, did not say, \"I will stand by Carter because of the risk he took in the campaign by saying what he would do for me.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis is hoping he can win because he is better than Bush: more competent and untainted by the last eight years. But Dukakis has to show what he will do, not what he is. He has to take a chance, bringing the party somewhere--to Black communities, for instance--not plopping it onto the middle of a fence and hoping people will come to it.</span></p>"}

Cambridge State Representative Saundra Graham deserved to lose last week's Democratic primary. She ran a lousy, practically invisible campaign against a relative political unknown and lost by 49 votes. She may yet salvage her political career, but not without a long, hard lesson in the ABCs of politics.</span></p> <p><span>Graham, a Cambridge political giant who holds both State House and City Council seats, has been an outspoken advocate of more money for public housing, day care and education--all important grass-roots \"people's issues.\" But Graham forgot the most basic political rule of them all--respecting and staying in close touch with her constituency.</span></p> <p><span>Shortly after hearing the election results, Graham admitted she had run a lackluster campaign by spending very little on publicity and failing to name a campaign manager. Yet the blame falls elsewhere: \"I blame it on a lot of things,\" Graham told the Crimson last week. \"I blame it on people's apathy. I blame it on the stories in the newspaper about my children. I blame it on what's been happening in Cambridge...\"</span></p> <p><span>Graham has no one but herself to blame. She should have learned her lesson last November. In a hotly-contested City Council election, she barely beat another political newcomer, Jonathan Myers, for a seat she has held since 1976. Instead of recognizing that her political base is fading, Graham blames her near-loss in that election on the complexities of the Cambridge proportional representation system, which encouraged liberal voters to support another progressive incumbent, David E. Sullivan, whom most people felt was facing a more serious challenge.</span></p> <p><span>Next week Graham will officially launch a \"sticker campaign\" against Alvin Thompson, the victor in last week's primary. This will require voters to affix stickers bearing Graham's name and address to their ballots, a tactic that requires much greater effort on the part of her campaign organization than a traditional contest would have.</span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>ER campaign will be a longshot effort by a candidate who was too lazy to seek the help of her constituency. Now, Graham's campaign has begun to assemble a paid staff and hopes to raise $1000 per day to help win back her disaffected constituency.</span></p> <p><span>Graham's supporters like to think of her as a champion of the underdog, and consider her a leader in the Legislature on crucial issues. They make an effective case that the politically unknown Thompson--a truant officer with the Cambridge School Department--would be far less influential as a legislator because of his pro-landlord position on rent control. As one Graham campaign aide put it, \"losing Saundra Graham would be a tragedy for Cambridge.\"</span></p> <p><span>Despite her record, Graham will have a difficult time trying to convince voters that she is still the effective, responsible, caring elected official her reputation makes her out to be. Her primary non-campaign was a display of arrogance, and it has not gone unpunished.</span></p> <p><span>An example she might look to for encouragement is that of her frequent political ally, Governor Michael S. Dukakis, whose arrogance and overconfidence cost him the 1978 Democratic gubernatorial primary. Four years later, having learned a lesson in humility, Dukakis returned to the State House and revived a dormant political career.</span></p> <p><span>But there is a significant difference.

With sugar. With caffeine. For real Americans.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis's advisers can rely on the old \"Coke adds life,\" campaign to add even more zest to their already boisterous candidate. As one insider notes, \"Thank God Coke adds life and not eyebrow hair.\"</span></p> <p><span>The ad campaign will be simple, elegant with a pithy slogan: \"Duke. Coke. A slant rhyme. A straight arrow.\"</span></p> <p><span>Luckily, campaign chairman John Sasso is back to run the attack against the Bush strategy.

{"title": "The Issues of the Day | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>G</b>IVE Garry Trudeau credit. At least when he complains that there have been few memorable discussions generated by this year's presidential election--a theme close to his heart in recent weeks--he can point to his own record of sharp political commentary. Few other prominent critics of the campaign between Gov. Michael Dukakis and Vice President George Bush have offered a thumb-nail sketch of their own publicly held political convictions, let alone a four-panel cartoon.</span></p> <p><span>For example, Len Downie, currently the Managing Editor of <i>The Washington Post</i> and a highly respected member of the journalistic community says he has not voted in a single political election since taking over his job. In an interview with a Washington magazine, he even said that he would prefer that none of his campaign reporters voted.</span></p> <p><span>Downie explained that such restraints on his personal convictions stem from a deep sense of fair play: How could an editor fulfill his high calling of accurately portraying the election news, knowing he favored one of the candidates being covered?</span></p> <p><span>Although one could imagine a host of issues that might sway Downie, for both personal and professional reasons--such as which candidate will appoint a Supreme Court that is less restrictive of press freedoms, or who is more likely to raise taxes--the Managing Editor will not be lured so easily. With the bad rap special interest groups have received in recent years, one can understand his reticence.</span></p> <p><span>But the <i>Washington Post</i> as a news entity cannot be a special interest or even the product of a more objective new gathering system; it is the product of an effectively one-newspaper town and has the unfortunate responsibility of offending nobody.</span></p> <p><span>Likewise, network news shows have confused their trend of becoming more and more predictable with the vaunted state of being objective. NBC News, for one, has launched a new slogan that claims it is the network that is \"first and fair.\" But all of this seems to be a sign that our institutions have become too powerful to have a stake in politics.</span></p> <p><span>Eisenhower's famed military-industrial complex--by which he meant a network of manufacturing giants beyond the control of any one president--is rapidly gaining hyphens. Make it the military-industrial-journalistic-higher education complex.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>BOUT that last hyphenated addition, take the case of President Bok. Earlier in the year, he was part of an influential panel of higher education leaders which released a report criticizing the quality of campaign debate about education. The report offered a host of problems that need the attention of candidates for high office.</span></p> <p><span>By now both campaigns have announced their education proposals. Dukakis's plan, which would allow students to pay back student loans over their lifetime as a small percentage of salary, is designed for middle-class students, who as a group most rely on borrowing. Bush has announced a more modest proposal, which would create special tax-free savings bonds for future family education, yet exclude families with a combined salary of more than $200,000.</span></p> <p><span>Odds are, with the campaign less than two months away, these are as detailed a treatment we can expect on the issues raised by Bok and the report. Throw into the equation the fact that the University has persistently complained about the Reagan Administration's policy of placing restrictions on government research, and it is clear that even fair Harvard's president might have a favorite in this election.</span></p> <p><span>Yet President, Bok in an interview last week, announced that he is standing by his position of not making endorsements in the presidential election.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HAT does it mean when important leaders of our society withdraw from the political debate? Can it be that they see themselves as the modern-day equivalents of mythology's Paris--believing that a wrong choice on their part could launch a thousand ships? What a thought. Either these leaders are right about their importance in society--which would be frightening enough--or, more disturbingly, they could be trying to guide our national institutions toward some ideal where values like Veritas and objectivity dwarf the petty concerns of partisan politics.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, this feeling is hardly a new one at Harvard. Criticizing University policy has always been considered a little bit like correcting a rabbi on liturgy during services--sacriligious, audacious and irrelevant. If Bok and the Corporation did not believe they were somehow above the fray political convictions, why would Harvard fail to divest of its South African holdings, after faculty dissent, 10 years of campus protest and a general consensus on the question? Ignoring such ephemeral considerations may be well and good for the University, which one sage aptly described as being here forever, as opposed to the student body which is remade from scratch in perfect, four-year cycles.</span></p> <p><span>But what is disturbing is that, the Harvard community aside, the American polity needs a diversity of opinion to make the best choice for the president. Taxpayers pay for federally financed elections to hold all else constant in relation to political argument.</span></p> <p><span>Bok is in an unparalleled position to explain the difference between the two candidates. Yet our institutions are becoming so large and all-powerful--through the growth of private universities and the decline of two-paper towns--that Bok may rightly conclude that Harvard's interests are so diverse that no one candidate can be better than another. We can all hope for the day when Harvard, the <i>Washington Post</i> and other national institutions recognize their duty to speak to the issues of the day.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Compassionate Comparisons | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE Republican Party's image of cold-heartedness and disdain for the poor, especially inner-city Blacks, has always disturbed me. So when I went to the Republican National Convention this August expecting to be turned off (and planning to vote for Gov. Michael Dukakis), I was pleasantly surprised to find that the words \"Republican\" and \"caring\" are not necessarily mutually exclusive.</span></p> <p><span>The key to this discovery was listening to a former presidential candidate, ex-Delaware Governor Pierre (Pete) DuPont. Although I am a registered Independent, I volunteered at the New Orleans convention, and there became acquainted with DuPont's positions by reading about him and listening to him speak.</span></p> <p><span>At first, it wasn't easy for me to take DuPont seriously. It didn't seem that a rich heir named Pierre, with tortoise-rim glasses and preppy clothes, would ooze with compassion for the poor. After all, this was a man who, during the Republican primaries, trumpeted a public school voucher system--a way to move the most motivated students to better schools, leaving the more academically needy students behind and spurring a further decline in the quality of inner-city education.</span></p> <p><span>Despite his voucher system and the remainder of his conservative agenda, DuPont made suprising overtures to another former candidate during the convention. He allied himself with Rev. Jesse Jackson. He even proposed that Republican economic policies are better suited to achieving Jackson's economic goals than Democratic policies.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>T a convention youth forum, DuPont suggested that during the campaign Jackson had spoken \"eloquently\" about the problems of the poor, especially the Black poor. He sent Jackson a telegram, praising him for his message, agreeing that a severe problem exists for this country's poor and suggesting that the subject deserves prompt attention.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, I immediately assumed that DuPont was being the quintessential opportunist. After all, any Republican would love to break the Democratic Party's grip on the poor and Black votes. Why not jump on the Jackson bandwagon and ride for all it's worth?</span></p> <p><span>Yet it was clear that DuPont strongly believed that Republican economic policies promoting economic growth, prosperity and smaller bureaucracy can aid the inner-city poor. Unlike most conservative Republicans, he was willing to acknowledge the urgency of the concerns that form the base of Jackson's platform. If he was not committed to solving these problems, why would he go out on a limb to invite comparisons and cooperation with the most liberal of liberals, while appealing to the most conservative of audiences?</span></p> <p><span>It would have been equally as opportunistic for DuPont to lambast Jackson with the usual rhetoric--calling him a leftist liberal, soft on communism and high on taxes. And he could have called Jackson a proponent of massive government handouts to redistribute the nation's wealth. He would have received quite a bit of applause from his eagerbeaver conservative audience.</span></p> <p><span>But DuPont chose the other route and forced me to realize that the choice between Democrat and Republican does not have to be a choice between economic emancipation and economic slavery. At least some Republicans endorse a pro-business, hands-off economic policy, not because they want to make the rich richer, but because they really believe this policy will achieve a commonly desired end--helping all Americans achieve a decent standard of living.</span></p> <p><span>DuPont was willing to ally himself with Jackson because he wanted to emphasize this common concern. And that step showed that at least some leading Republicans care enough to acknowledge the problems of inner-city poverty and to dedicate themselves to finding workable solutions. This will probably be enough to make me vote for Vice President George Bush.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Best Defense for Dukakis is a Good Offense | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>RAILING, or at best dead-even with George Bush in the polls, Mike Dukakis finds himself going into this Sunday night's television debate at the most critical point of his public career.</span></p> <p><span>It is hard to believe that just two months ago Dukakis was a full seventeen points ahead of Bush in the polls; politicos, effectively writing off Bush, were already contemplating who was going to get which position in the Dukakis Administration.</span></p> <p><span>What happened to the Dukakis lead? The answer to that question reveals the problems that have been plaguing the Dukakis campaign over the last month. It is a metamorphosized George Bush, or better yet, the revamped campaign philosophy coming out of the Bush camp. The strategy could have come right out of a Vince Lombardi playbook: offense, offense, offense. Keep your opponent on the defensive even when he thinks he's attacking.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's handlers very effectively moved the campaign onto more comfortable ground. By equating Dukakis with Carter and Mondale they are suddenly running against the type of candidate history shows they can defeat.</span></p> <p><span>Bush has portrayed Dukakis as a paradigmatic \"America-bashing\" ACLU liberal who isn't proud of his flag, wants to make America weak militarily and wants to raise taxes. Bush has even trumped Dukakis' strongest cards--competent management and the Massachusetts Miracle--by throwing mouthfuls of statistics at the public implying that the Bay State is not half the utopia its Governor and would-be-President would have us believe. Bush supporters point to polls showing the two candidates running neck and neck.</span></p> <p><span>Although many of Bush's attacks have been heavier on show than substance, they have served their political purposes. First of all, they have salvaged Bush's once-written-off candidacy, and put him in front of Dukakis in the polls.</span></p> <p><span>But even more importantly, the Bush strategy is forcing Dukakis to respond and react rather than put forth his own initiatives. In this way, Bush has pushed Dukakis onto political low ground and kept him there by tying him to an allegation too dangerous to be left unanswered: same candidate, new face.</span></p> <p><span>In questioning Dukakis' patriotism, Bush has attacked both Dukakis' immigrant background and liberal philosophy. The first was a key component of Dukakis' populist \"American Dream\" theme which was originally so appealing to minority, underprivileged, and middle class voters. \"Hey, this guy is one of us,\" they started to say. That is, until Bush began to suggest that Dukakis was not \"one of us\" precisely because he was too tied to his immigrant roots, as well as too tied to a liberal-academic ideology outside the political mainstream. Result? Dukakis has been much quieter on his immigrant background and ACLU membership.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, much of what Dukakis has been doing lately on the campaign trail has been an attempt to counter the I'm-more-of-a-populist attacks Bush has levelled against him. This includes everything from trying to list all the other states that have prison furlough systems (\"I'm <i>not</i> outside the American political mainstream\") to riding around in an M-1 tank.</span></p> <p><span>Clearly, Dukakis cannot win a Reagan-Carter or Reagan-Mondale rematch. But this does not need to be the essence of the election. Dukakis can salvage his campaign by launching a \"populist counter-attack;\" Bush is more vulnerable to this than is at first evident.</span></p> <p><span><b>D</b>UKAKIS would do well to connect Bush's \"chameleon-like\" political nature with his ties to the Far Right. The gist of a Dukakis line of attack here would be that Bush is, if not a member, then a marionette of this reactionary fringe group, just as Bush has tried to link Dukakis to the radical left.</span></p> <p><span>How was it that Bush, who was once in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment and pro-choice on abortion, changed his spots overnight when he became Reagan's running mate?</span></p> <p><span>While this tack may consolidate Bush's conservative following, it should help bring the undecided and wavering moderates/independents--who may not be extremely liberal, but who do not identify with the Far Right either--into the Dukakis camp. This strategy, which failed Mondale in '84, is viable now due to the shift in popular opinion concerning the Far Right in light of the televangelist and Iran-Contragate scandals which have tarnished their image.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, Dukakis can seize the initiative on the defense issue by noting the hypocrisy in Bush's positions. Although Bush is fond of using the Midgetman and MX missles in his speeches, it would be somewhat awkward for him to explain why \"his\" Administration dumped the Midgetman in Congress as \"too expensive,\" or why it scrapped Carter's plans to deploy the MX in the Southwest without offering an alternative, giving it a quiet death.</span></p> <p><span>In short, Dukakis, must start arraigning Bush. As someone challenging a fairly popular status quo, the burden of proof is on him to show us the \"Why?\" behind the imperative, \"Change.\" He cannot do this if he is constantly on the defensive. Put George Bush on the stand; seize the \"populist initiative.\" This has to be Dukakis' gameplan through November or else he will lose as surely as Mondale did in '84 and Carter did in '80. Sunday night's debate will be Dukakis' best chance to get back on the offensive.</span></p>"}

Kennedy '40, the founders decreed that Harvard's School of Public Administration would be training an elite new corps of public servants to serve the nation.</span></p> <p><span>In practice, that meant the Kennedy School soon acquired a reputation for turning out a new breed of technobureaucrats with advanced degrees and progressive, but pragmatic, ideas about the role of government. The federal government, that is.</span></p> <p><span>But in the course of the new \"internationalization\" drive, the Kennedy school has been shying away from the active national political role it has cultivated over the past 25 years--and in the process, publicly severing the ties which bind it to Democractic candidate Dukakis.</span></p> <p><span>Aggressive non-partisanship in this most political of election years is a difficult task for a school of government, but Kennedy School professors and administrators, schooled in the art of public relations, seem to be trying their hardest to dispel rumors that the Duke has his own think-tank on the Charles.</span></p> <p><span>One apocryphal story has it that when professors planning to move to Washington for the Dukakis Administration line up for the ride, the Greyhound bus they expected will be replaced by a jeep, and a small one at that.</span></p> <p><span>So why now, in an election year that pits former Kennedy School lecturer Dukakis against Vice President George Bush, has the focus suddenly turned outward?</span></p> <p><span>After all, Dukakis came to the Kennedy School after his shocking defeat in the 1978 gubernatorial race and re-emerged four years later as an invigorated and victorious politician. And when he returned to the State House he brought with him so many Kennedy School colleagues that Allison was forced to personally negotiate a hiring freeze with the governor.</span></p> <p><span>Something has obviously changed since then. It's not that the number of Kennedy School scholars advising Dukakis has decreased, but that the governor has somehow fallen out of official favor.</span></p> <p><span>In general, professors at the school of government love to talk to the press, love to see the phrase \"Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government\" in print. Some say that when people at the Kennedy School are bored, they count the number of references to the school inserted into the Congressional Record. But if someone wants to write about the school's links to Dukakis, they try to downplay the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>YNICS would say that the school's high-profile scholars and administrators have given up on the Dukakis campaign. When queried now about the Massachusetts governor, school officials invariably respond by saying that President Reagan brought in more Kennedy School professors than any of his Democratic predecessors.</span></p> <p><span>But, as all good students of politics know, it's not the numbers which matter but the public's perception of the numbers. And it seems now as though the Kennedy School, in its attempt to divert attention from the political successes of one of its former lecturers, has adopted a \"new direction\" that is nothing but a cloak with which to disguise the fact.</span></p> <p><span>If the Kennedy School of Government plans to become an international center, then call it a school of diplomacy or of foreign relations. Otherwise, observers should ask: Why all the fuss?</span></p>"}

Her response was simple and profound: \"How can this be?\"</span></p> <p><span>How, indeed, in the wealthiest nation on earth, can a hospital withhold treatment from a child, prolonging his pain and suffering? Because he, like 37 million other Americans, has no health insurance.</span></p> <p><span>I explained to my incredulous German friend that the United States is the only industrial nation, save South Africa, that doesn't guarantee medical treatment as a right of citizenship. In the nation that produces medical wonders such as the artificial heart, nearly 60 million people have either inadequate medical coverage, or no coverage at all.</span></p> <p><span>Incidents like the one in the Humana emergency room are not rare, despite federal regulations. This year, a Miami resident, Edwina Hayes, suffered with a bullet in her back for 13 hours as she shuttled from one South Florida Hospital to another before an emergency room finally admitted her.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T needn't be that way. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who spearheaded the effort to bring universal health insurance to Massachusetts, has just unveiled a plan to extend medical coverage to the rest of the country.</span></p> <p><span>Under Dukakis' program, employers would be required to provide a basic insurance package to workers, and to pay a portion, perhaps 80 percent, of the annual premium. The coverage would pay for hospital stays, clinical visits, tests and diagnostic services, prenatal and pediatric care, and mental health care. Dukakis' plan would also provide tax breaks to assist small businesses in establishing insurance plans.</span></p> <p><span>Vice President George Bush, who stood by as the Reagan administration attempted again and again to slash health benefits, reacted predictably. \"It's socialized medicine,\" said Bush, \"plain and simple.\"</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps it is, George, and not a day too soon. At least, the Democrats believe that medical care should not be a luxury on par with pearls and furs. A child's smashed nose ought to be treated, whether he's a poor Appalachian boy or an Andover blue-blood.</span></p> <p><span>In essence, Democrats believe that the relief of pain is a basic right--necessary for life and the pursuit of happiness.</span></p> <p><span>Bush called Dukakis' plan \"a prescription for financial disaster.\" Yet, the U.S. treasury would suffer no net loss from the plan. Savings on medicare payments would compensate for lost revenue from the tax breaks to small businesses. The total cost to business is estimated at $27 billion, only $10 billion more than they currently pay.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, Canada, Sweden and Germany, for instance, offer high quality univeral medical care, and spend a smaller percentage of their gross national product on health than does the United States.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>O cost is not the issue. The issue is whether Americans will collectively bear the burden of treating illness, just as we share the burden of defense and police protection. Or will we simply tell the sick and injured of the working class, \"tough luck.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bush's stance is not suprising. As Vice President, in 1985 he cast the deciding vote in favor of increasing out of pocket expenses for elderly medicare recipients. With his patrician upbringing, Bush doesn't seem to understand middle-class dilemmas such as, \"Should I go to the doctor about that hacking cough, or should I buy shoes for my children?\"</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis' plan will eliminate the need for such decisions. To borrow from Jesse Jackson, it places public health above private wealth.</span></p> <p><span>For weeks, pundits have advised Dukakis to push forth a few bold, new proposals in order to \"define himself.\" No other issue better defines the stark choice we have before us in November--the choice between compassion and callousness.</span></p>"}

{"title": "A Case of Too Many Cases? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When Lisa J. Schkolnick '88 took her grievance against the male-only admissions policy of a final club to the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination last fall, she was only one of many who asked the agency to investigate discrimination.</span></p> <p><span>More than 3000 other people turned to the quasi-judical body last year to seek redress against a variety of organizations for unfair employment, housing and public accommodations practices. The commission has power akin to that of a lower court, it can award damages and order an organization to change its practices.</span></p> <p><span>Created in 1946 as the Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC), the commission was expected to fill the gap left by the demise of a similar federal program in the aftermath of World War II. Previously--in 1943--the state had approved the Massachusetts Committee on Racial and Religious Understanding in response to racerelated violence around the country.</span></p> <p><span>\"This committee was the direct ancestor of the MCAD,\" writes Leon H. Mayhew in his 1968 study of the commission. \"Its function was to carry out investigations and to sponsor and assist educational programs designed to combat discrimination.\"</span></p> <p><span>When, in 1950, Massachusetts outlawed segregation and discrimination in public housing, it gave the FEPC power over this area, renaming it the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination. Since that time, both the state and the federal government have expanded their antidiscrimination laws, so MCAD's responsibilities have steadily grown.</span></p> <p><span>Today, MCAD deals with discrimination in many areas--housing, employment, public accommodations--and in many forms--sex, race color, religion, ethnicity, age, marital status and ancestry, among them.</span></p> <p><span>In 1956, the state passed a law guaranteeing that \"students, otherwise qualified, be admitted to educational institutions without regard to race, color, religion, creed or national origin,\" adding universities and secondary schools--including Harvard--to MCAD's domain.</span></p> <p><span>MCAD's most recent change of domain came in 1984 when the body was given responsibility for protecting the handicapped. Complaints from the handicapped, who were previously not protected by a state body, have made up 18 percent of all cases since that time, says MCAD's Deputy Director of Administration Terrence P. Morris.</span></p> <p><span>Seventy percent of the agency's cases involve allegations of employment discrimination, and 20 percent involve housing. Public accommodations complaints, including charges of discrimination against groups of people by social organizations--like the nine final clubs--restaurants and even airlines, account for much of the rest.</span></p> <p><span>Public accommodations cases had become less common in recent years, but Commissioner Kathleen M. Allen says, \"it has started to increase again because issues of sex and race are pertinent again.\" Allen says the publicity surrounding recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions against single sex clubs has put this type of complaint back in the public eye. Most complainants file claims of gender or racial discrimination.</span></p> <p><span>Many complaints are referred to the state body by other groups. When last fall Schkolnick decided to take the Fly Club to task for its men-only admissions policy, she took her grievance to the Cambridge Human Rights Commission. But that group lacked the resources to see the case through, so it referred Schkolnick to MCAD. Civil rights organizations, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights also deal with MCAD.</span></p> <p><span>\"We refer cases to them often--sometimes everyday,\" says a spokesman for the Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, the local branch of the American Civil Liberties Union. He said cases were often given to the commission \"because they've got a large staff, and we've only have two lawyers.\"</span></p> <p><span>The agency's caseload has been steadily increasing since its creation and has expanded rapidly in the past few years.</span></p> <p><span>In fiscal year 1988, 3172 complaints were filed, almost double the number the commission annually dealt with a decade ago. The current figure is also more than 11 times MCAD's annual caseload during the 1940s and 1950s.</span></p> <p><span>The caseload continues to increase, and Morris says that if the proposed Sexual Preference Bill--prohibiting discrimination based on sexual preference--is passed by the state, it \"would increase our caseload skyhigh.\"</span></p> <p><span>But the agency may be growing so fast that it cannot deal with cases effectively. Several years ago, the average case took 400 days, and MCAD changed its procedures to bring the waiting period down to 244 days. However, in fiscal year 1988, the average case duration--from filing to completion--had climbed back up to 288 days.</span></p> <p><span>Massachusetts pays only 53 full-time MCAD employees spread out in four offices across the state. And federal and private sources fund less than a dozen more.</span></p> <p><span>Budget cuts of more than $300,000 made this year will only exacerbate the manpower shortage. The commission receives the majority of its money from the state, although the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) also contribute to the budget.</span></p> <p><span>Even though Morris says he expects federal funds to increase slightly this year because of an increased caseload, it still will not compensate for the fact that last year's $1,940,000 budget had been reduced to $1,578,00.</span></p> <p><span>According to Morris, staff members will not be laid off as a result of the cut, but, with less money around, the commission may be less able to push cases to a timely end.</span></p> <p><span>Last year the commission received $252,000 dollars from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and another $100,000 from other sources.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, the EEOC pays $400 per employment complaint that it receives and automatically passes along to MCAD for processing. EEOC's annual contribution is based on the previous year's caseload, and the federal agency conducts reviews during the year to see if the funds are adequate, says Renee Devine, communications director for EEOC in Washington.</span></p> <p><span>However, those funds might run short. Devine says Congress has \"earmarked\" $20 million for the EEOC to distribute to state and local agencies, a cap which the agency may exceed.</span></p> <p><span>Such a shortfall could mean that MCAD would get less money to deal with more cases, in which case, Devine says, the federal body might take over some case processing.</span></p> <p><span>Although the budget cuts and increasing caseload have placed additional burdens on MCAD, the agency has improved in some areas. Al Owens, director of the Boston branch of the NAACP says that since 1986, the commission has dealt with complaints more thoroughly. MCAD officials themselves say that the agency has grown more aggressive under Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' administration.</span></p> <p><span>\"The past two [NAACP] presidents cited [MCAD's] process as being not too careful or too slow,\" says Owens, but he adds that lately there have been few problems. He says the two groups now have \"a good working relationship,\" adding that NAACP refers nearly 100 cases to the agency each year. He says he believes hearings are now held more often than in the past, and settlements are more frequent.</span></p> <p><span>\"That means someone is looking [out] more on behalf of the people being discriminated against,\" Owens says. And he adds he is pleased that MCAD hired two people who were referred to the commission by the NAACP's job placement program.</span></p> <p><span>And last month, another change took place that may speed up MCAD's processes--the agency automated the filing of complaints. MCAD staff members now feed a complaint directly into computers in the intake room, instead of typing up forms. The new system cuts down on processing time, making it easier for an investigator to check the status of a case or keep track of new information. \"It could save up to three weeks in clearing cases out of here,\" Morris says.</span></p> <p><span>\"We're trying to scratch our way into the 20th century,\" Allen says, adding that the computer allows cases to be simultaneously filed with the state and federal government, if they share jurisdiction.</span></p> <p><span>And if the increasingly conservative U.S. Supreme Court restricts civil rights law as some liberals fear, that might also alter MCAD's caseload. If federal laws are struck down, it is possible that more state residents would turn to MCAD for protection under Massachusetts laws.</span></p>"}

No one can deny that Vice President George Bush and Gov. Michael Dukakis are diametrically opposed on almost any topic of immediate or long-range consequence, from abortion to Star Wars.</span></p> <p><span>But, as the campaign plods wearily on, it seems as though the issues have become caricatures of themselves, grossly expanding to support the view of Dukakis as the quintessential impractical liberal or Bush as the rational conservative. What seems to matter more is appearance--which candidate can bring more laughs, which can hold his own in verbal battles, which loves his wife more than the other.</span></p> <p><span>The issues have lost ground in the campaign because there are few ideological battles left. People who hold an opinion on either side of any of the most gripping controversies in a campaign, like abortion, the death penalty or aid to the contras, are firm in their ideology--and thus in their presidential choice. Most people simply won't vote for a leader who disagrees with their stand on an issue basic to their view of the world.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, paradoxically enough, the policy differences between the two candidates are so clear-cut that they have been rendered less relevant.</span></p> <p><span>If voters have made up their mind on heartfelt issues, they are unlikely to shift away from the candidate that takes their side, no matter how much more eloquently the opposition is presented.</span></p> <p><span>In a TV spot this summer about the campaign, one woman said, \"I'm just going to vote for Dukakis because of his stand on abortion, but I really don't see much difference between the two.\"</span></p> <p><span>Voters who are not set in their convictions about basic issues are fair game for the current campaign strategies. Those people are left to base their decision on more superfluous factors, and unfortunately, these factors have become the focus in the current contest.</span></p> <p><span>What won points for Bush and Dukakis in Sunday's debate was probably not their hard core stands on matters of ideological import. The people who are affected by those stands effectively cast their votes long ago. The candidates' ability to banter and cast stones was what won them any of the votes still up for grab.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis' Joe Isuzu crack probably pulled in more kudos than his defense of government-supported housing programs. Bush's comment that Dukakis' reply was \"about as clear as Boston Harbor\" probably garnered him more votes than his plug for the MX Missile. It's no wonder, really. Everyone loves someone who can make him laugh. And since Dukakis has long been criticized for his lack of passion, he could only stand to gain from demonstrating an ability to quip and snicker.</span></p> <p><span>This turns the campaign into a farce. The candidates, bowled over by the weight of their own differences, trade barbs like children. The public, having already passed judgement on the issues, sucks up rumors of flag-burning and psychological trouble, and eagerly awaits the next low-hitting punch from one candidate to the other.</span></p> <p><span>Uncertain voters will be impressed by the barbs, the laughs and the cutting retorts or maybe by which candidate is better able to keep his cool.

{"title": "Bright as the STARS | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b>FTER a month of campaigning complacently on such vague themes as \"good jobs at good wages,\" Michael S. Dukakis earlier this month unveilied a specific and comprehensive plan designed to help lower-and middle-income students pay for a college education.</span></p> <p><span>The Student Tuition and Repayment System (STARS) that Dukakis proposes would give low-interest loans to any student who needs them. Banks would provide the loans, with the federal government guaranteeing them and serving as their collector. Students would pay into a loan fund over their lifetime by having a small percentage of their annual salaries withheld.</span></p> <p><span>The Dukakis loan proposal comes at a critical time. College costs have fast outpaced the growth of family incomes since 1980, and the Reagan Administration has been reluctant to make up the gap. Even with adjustments for inflation, federal student aid has fallen by 6 percent during this period and has been increasingly concentrated in the form of loans rather than grants, forcing more middle-income students and families to take on oppressive debt burdens. As a result, default rates have skyrocketed to record levels.</span></p> <p><span>The proposed program has several advantages over the existing Stafford Student Loans, as the former Guaranteed Student Loan program is now called. Since repayments are directly taken from one's earnings, like Social Security deductions or income tax withholding, default is rendered virtually impossible.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>INCE students who take higher-income jobs end up subsidizing those who have lower-paying ones, Bush campaign officials were quick to charge that this program is inherently unfair. Yet such deeply entrenched federal programs as Social Security and the federal income tax operate on this same principle, namely that those who can afford to pay more should do so to ensure the solvency of the program.</span></p> <p><span>Even for all the vice president's talk about his desire to be the education president, his only major education proposal--tax breaks for parents who buy savings bonds to finance their children's college education--is far more modest than the Dukakis plan. The STARS program, higher education officials agree, is much more likely to address the growing middle-class squeeze which occurs when students cannot afford rising tuition costs, but fail to qualify for federal grants. Combined with Dukakis's pledge to increase federal grants for lowincome students, the STARS program represents a welcome relief to students fearful of rising tuitions and the scarcity of federal grants.</span></p> <p><span>Too often in the past, presidential candidates have tried to sway voters by proclaiming their support for education and then have failed to provide any leadership on such important issues as accelerating tuitions, the middle class squeeze, and the disturbing shift from grants to loans by the federal government during the last seven years. Though the final details of the STARS program still have to be fully worked out, the concept is a sound one: that access to a college education should not be determined by one's financial status.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Lying Down on the Job | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I'</b>VE finally figured out what's gone wrong with the presidential campaign. It's not that the two nominees are usually aiming straight for each other's jugular. We've come to expect that every four years. No, what's wrong with this campaign is that the fine art of lying has died a quiet death.</span></p> <p><span>Take Gary Hart, for example. Obviously, he lacked training in the finer art of lying. He forgot the cardinal rule: never get caught. And if you do get caught, you might as well try the truth. Look at the campaign of 1884, which instead of focusing on the issues, degenerated into one of personal abuse and vilification (sound familiar?). The Republican party led by James G. Blaine coined the catchy phrase, \"Ma, ma, where's my pa?\" to needle Grover Cleveland about his illegitimate child. But Cleveland admitted his responsibility and look where that got him. \"Gone to the White House, ha, ha, ha!\"</span></p> <p><span>Another essential rule about lying is that the timing has to be perfect, a subtlety to which vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle is not attuned. When someone asks you about your decision to use family connections in joining the National Guard during the Vietnam War, the right lie is not: \"I did not know in 1969 that I would be in this room today.\"</span></p> <p><span>Everyone knows that hindsight is always more perceptive than foresight, but perception, among other words, seems to be absent from Quayle's vocabulary. Of course, everyone regrets one past act or another, but it just isn't wise to answer a question about integrity and personal ethics with a comment about your early ambitions.</span></p> <p><span><b>L</b>YING, and lying well, is especially important in such advanced times as our own, when television cameras and microphones can pick up every gesture, every word, every nuance and display them to millions of titillated viewers. Recently, my employer said to me, \"You'll find in the law profession, you don't always say what you believe.\" This was a lawyer speaking, one of those people who are supposed to fight for truth, justice, and the American way (actually, scratch the last term; after listening to all the campaign rhetoric, I'm not sure just what that phrase means anymore).</span></p> <p><span>Politics is, and must be, deceptive. Even though George Bush may think of his grandchildren as \"the little brown ones,\" it's not necessary to proclaim that loudly to the President and the rest of the American public. Tact, which is merely a milder form of lying, is essential in politics, and it's time Bush learned that lesson.</span></p> <p><span>Bush should also learn that there are some situations where brazen lies and intentional deceptions won't work. I'm referring to Barbara Bush. Does anyone really believe Barbara Bush is out there in the ghettos, teaching youngsters how to read? Does anyone really think that George walks around the vicepresidential living room, slapping Barbara on the butt after a tremendous meal? Bush's familial affections just don't match up to Dukakis' loving relationship with his wife.

{"title": "Bush: Gimme Shelters | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>Y</b>OU can tell when it's autumn because the wind starts to get a little bit colder, and there's a lot of talk about elections, especially in the year of a presidential campaign. What autumn also means is that the growing numbers of homeless people in this country are soon going to have to figure out where the warmest doorways or heating vents are so that they'll have somewhere to sleep if the shelters are too full.</span></p> <p><span>As anyone who lives in Cambridge and walks around Harvard Square knows, the plight of homeless people is a continuing problem. It has grown to such an extent that it merited a full set of questions to the presidential candidates in their televised debate Sunday night. Regardless of whose sound bites were better or whose memorized one-liner was catchier, Dukakis clearly showed that he was taking the homeless issue seriously. Such concern would be a welcome change after what Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) once called \"a seven-year assault on federal housing policies by the Reagan Administration\"--policies which are in large measure responsible for the huge numbers of displaced persons walking our streets.</span></p> <p><span>Vice President George Bush's response to the question posed Sunday night showed just how insensitive he would be to the problems of homeless people. The only bit of substance in his answer to the problem was his support for fully funding the McKinney Act, a proposal that would create more shelters for the homeless, even making some out of unnecessary Army bases.</span></p> <p><span>What Bush totally avoided was the fact that his Administration helped cause the problem of homelessness by cutting funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development earmarked for providing low-income housing. Bush pointed out proudly that his Administration was responsible for low interest rates, but those low interest rates were used to regentrify our cities' neighborhoods.</span></p> <p><span>Regentrification is the process by which developers came into areas that had normally been inhabited by low-income renters and began erecting high priced condos. People living on welfare cannot afford condominiums. The more high-rent places you build without building new low-rent homes, the more people you force to live on the street. The U.S. Conference of Mayors found that by 1985, the homeless population was growing by 25 percent a year, and homeless families were the fastest growing group in that population.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>ND what did the Reagan Administration do about this problem? In their budget for fiscal year 1988, the Reagan Administration took 5 percent out of HUD's budget, commited no funds for any new construction of public housing and only reluctantly spared a program which would enable local goverments to help landlords rehabilitate low-income rental units. At the same time, the Administration, for the seventh year in a row, tried to fully drop the Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) program, which aims at encouraging private development of low-income housing in distressed areas. Each year the Congress, Democratic House and Republican Senate alike, stopped the Administration.</span></p> <p><span>The same attitude characterized the Administration's latest budget proposal. There were a couple differences, though, since it is an election year. Even though he continued to oppose the UDAG program, Reagan, with Bush by his side, allowed for the building of new government-subsidized rental units. The Administration had always forcefully opposed such building before.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis pointed out that Bush was in part responsible for the homeless problem by reducing the federal government's commitment to affordable housing and stated clearly that until you build housing that people can afford, they are going to have to live on the street. The commitment has to be reaffirmed, and Dukakis has stated that he will do exactly that.</span></p> <p><span>For Bush to think that shelters would in any way alleviate the situation borders on callousness. No Family or individual trying to live in a temporary shelter each night, without any guarantee that there will always be room for them, will be able to feel any of the self-esteem or just plain security that allow people to live normal lives. When you have to worry each and every day about where your children will sleep that night, or where food will come from, you can't focus attention on getting a steady job or getting your children to school, and you can't break out of the poverty cycle that helped make you homeless in the first place. A shelter is not a home, even though George Bush can't seem to tell the difference.</span></p> <p><span>Bush may indeed be \"haunted\" by the plight of the homeless, and there may be \"a thousand points of light\" to help care for those without homes. But what there is most assuredly not is a commitment from his Administration to guaranteeing that the objects of charity might one day be able to support themselves.</span></p>"}

Hundreds of Jackson supporters gathered yesterday to discuss \"Building the Rainbow After Atlanta.\"</span></p> <p><span>Some Jackson supporters are already sporting \"Jackson 1992\" buttons, and they made it clear that their leader will be around next time to challenge the conscience of the party.

Wright has been accused of giving jobs to his friends and sending a lot of business in the general direction of his home state--many of the same accusations that were leveled at Texan and former President Lyndon B. Johnson.</span></p> <p><span>In Texas, where depressed oil prices have brought on some bad times, voters probably don't care what outsiders have to say about Wright.

He has only engaged in some good old-fashioned pork-barrelling.</span></p> <p><span>On the other hand, Meese is a member of the Reagan-Bush administration. How can Bush, a vice-president who claims to be a hands on leader, be ignorant of the attorney general's actions? Bush should be held accountable for Meese's actions right along with Reagan.</span></p> <p><span>This could end up hurting Bush not too far into the future. As Bush makes his second run for President, he is expecting Texas to send its dozen or so electoral votes his way. But he may not be as successful at rounding up those votes for himself as he was for Reagan.</span></p> <p><span>Texas cannot be discounted by either party.

But Bush, banking on his manufactured nativity, assumes that he will win the largest state in the South without any problem.</span></p> <p><span>Bush cannot assume Texas is a notch in his belt simply because he proclaims himself a native son. This kind of \"Southern Strategy\" won't work in the face of Dukakis' strong Hispanic and Black support--33 percent of the state's population is Black and Hispanic. Questions about his involvement in the Iran-contra scandal and his knowledge about Meese's ethical transgressions will plague him to defeat.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>ND if Dukakis chose a native Texan, say Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, as his running mate, Texas would almost certainly vote Democrat. Bentsen, born and bred in Texas, would portray Bush as the true prep-school Northerner he really is. With another choice, Texans would quickly turn from the part-time Texan with three homes around the United States. Besides, Bush just put down the state's hero.</span></p> <p><span>Bush will have to present legitimate reasons for Texans to vote for him, something he lacks. His only campaign slogan in the past was that Texas was his home state, and he can't count on that if he keeps insulting the only person who cares enough to actually help the state.</span></p> <p><span>Bush is not the real Texan he proposes to be.

The Reagan Administration also showed extreme insensitivity when it supported tax breaks for racially discriminatory organizations like Bob Jones University. And his Supreme Court appointees are already working to roll back past rulings which aided minorities.</span></p> <p><span>Earlier this year, the President vetoed the Civil Rights Restoration Act, which bars institutions which receive federal assistance from discriminating on the basis of sex, race, age, or physical handicap. Fortunately, on March 22, Congress soundly overturned the Reagan veto.</span></p> <p><span>There was once a large wing of the Republican party which proudly embraced civil rights measures.

Since 1980, however, the party has done little to further this cause.</span></p> <p><span>With Reagan at the helm, many other influential Republicans are afraid to stand up for civil rights. Republican Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole has a civil rights record so solid that it won praise from Coretta Scott King.

When he loses to Mike Dukakis, he's going to marvel about why less than 5 percent of Black voters publicly supported him.</span></p> <p><span>A strong economy, the Republican party's strongest political asset, will do nothing to win the votes of Blacks, who have been left by the wayside of the \"robust\" American economy. While March unemployment was only 5.5 percent nationally, Black unemployment was a staggering 12.8 percent. Minorities are more likely to be poor--nearly half of all Black children live beneath the poverty level.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N this country where \"All men are created equal,\" not a single governor is Black.

{"title": "Duke Clinches Nomination Behind Primary Victories | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Governor Michael S. Dukakis moved to the brink of victory in the Democratic presidential race last night, winning in New Jersey and waiting for California to seal his triumph in a coast-to-coast finale to the primary season. George Bush said he would stress \"prosperity and peace\" in his fight to hold the White House for the Republicans.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis was defeating the Rev. Jesse Jackson by a margin of 67 percent to 29 percent in New Jersey's primary, and was winning New Mexico by almost as large a margin. He was favored to complete a four-state sweep with victories in Montana and California.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis began the night needing roughly 150 delegates to achieve a mathematical lock on the nomination. He was certain to top the magic 2081 goal when the votes were counted in California.</span></p> <p><span>Bush, who has lost ground in the polls since wrapping up the Republican nomination more than a month ago, won the New Jersey and New Mexico primaries unopposed--and had no active competition in the other two states, either. He said the political momentum would swing his way once his campaign brought the issues of peace and prosperity into focus for the voters.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Democrats are out there tearing down the administration, me, and in many areas things that I think make this country click,\" he said in an NBC interview.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson offered no rebuttal to the claims of victory from the Dukakis camp, andalready was turning his attention to the nextphase of a remarkable campaign. Talk of the vicepresidential nomination, convention platformissues and changes in party rules affecting futurecampaigns was in the air even before the pollingplaces opened to voters on the final primary dayof the year.</span></p> <p><span>In New Jersey, with returns from 48 percent ofthe precincts counted, Dukakis had 198.233 or 67percent. Jackson had 85,307, or 29 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Republican returns lagged far behind. With 6percent counted, Bush had 14,898 votes for 94percent.</span></p> <p><span>In New Mexico, with returns from 21 percent ofthe precincts, it was Dukakis 23,014, or 62percent, to Jackson's 9298 or 25 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Bush had 78 percent of the vote in hisuncontested race. That translated to 13,403 from20 percent of the precincts.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's primary victories were as secure ascould be. But because his campaign was nearingfederal spending limits, he mounted only ashoestring effort in New Jersey and California,possibly placing himself at a disadvantage in twoimportant battleground states in the fallcampaign.</span></p> <p><span>Advisers predicted the vice president wouldbegin sharpening his attacks on Dukakis as soon asthe Democratic nominating war was officiallysettled, perhaps beginning at the Texas GOPConvention on Thursday and a party unity event inDenver on Friday.</span></p> <p><span>Bush sounded like he was more than ready,telling NBC in an interview, \"the differences areenormous\" between himself and Dukakis. \"It will belike the McGovern-Nixon race in '72 in terms ofthe breadth of differences on these issues,\" hesaid. Nixon won that race in a landslide.</span></p> <p><span>The vice president said he also would besetting out differences on a variety of issueswith the Reagan administration, saying, \"I do haveto spell out my own identity...\"</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis was looking beyond the primaries, aswell. He arranged to pick up endorsements todayfrom former rivals Rep. Richard Gephardt ofMissori and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, and saidhe hoped Jackson would also work for the ticket.And he was expected to meet with aides this weekfor discussions on selecting a running mate andplanning the nominating convention.</span></p> <p><span>Even as his faint hopes of stopping Dukakis'nomination were being snuffed out, Jackson was atwork on the next phase of his campaign. He said hehad earned \"the option\" of a vice presidentialoffer, vowed a floor fight at the convention ifDukakis doesn't toughen his position against SouthAfrica and pressed for changes in delegate rules.</span></p> <p><span>But with a Bush-Dukakis general electioncampaign already taking shape, the final round ofprimaries seemed a mere formality. The onlysuspense centered around how quickly theMassachusetts governor would amass the remainingdelegates needed to clinch his first ballotnomination at the party convention next month.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis went into the final primaries with 1927delegates, 154 short of the total required toclinch the nomination.

{"title": "City Year: Banking on Young People | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Now that the campaigns are about over and working for Dukakis or Bush seems about as interesting as listening to them, are the only high-energy careers left for Harvard graduates in investment banking, consulting, or making superconductors? Does entering public service mean doing social work that relies on dwindling federal funds or being an anonymous bureaucrat in the Department of Inefficiency?</span></p> <p><span>No, says Mitch N. Berman '88, who this summer will join Law School graduates Alan A. Khazei '83 and Michael H. Brown '84 at one of the most creative public service initiatives in Boston--City Year, a non-profit venture which uses college-age volunteers in public service projects.</span></p> <p><span>Founded by Khazei and Brown, this \"urban Peace Corps\" program will get into full gear in a few weeks. Although it was developed from an idea to a reality just this year, City Year has drawn together a working group which includes recent graduates and students of Harvard College, Law, Business and Kennedy Schools. Equally critical to making the City Year experiment fly is its impressive and expanding group of advisors and sponsors, which includes former U.S. Senator Paul Tsongas, Radcliffe President Matina S. Horner and the Bank of Boston.</span></p> <p><span>Ironically, the model for this fresh venture is a quarter century old. Just like the original Peace Corps, founded by John F. Kennedy '40 in 1962, City Year will ask young people to take on the challenge of aiding needy communities. City Year participants are not, however, going to Nepal or rural villages in Kenya. These 17 to 20 year-olds from Greater Boston will be serving their own backyard, assisting local social service agencies and non-profit groups in places like Roxbury, Dorchester and Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span>City Year advisor and Kennedy School Fellow Winthrop Knowlton '53 calls it \"the most exciting public service initiative any of us have seen in our lifetimes.\"</span></p> <p><span>For many of its 50 participants, including Harvard sophomore Chris K. Murphy '90, City Year is a chance to try something different. Although many of his friends are spending their summer as interns in law and business offices, Murphy says he believes there will be plenty of chances to do that after graduation.</span></p> <p><span>Murphy will be working with the Boston Food Bank and the Adopt-a-Nursing-Home Program. \"Harvard is an intense forum for liberal discussion, but City Year is finally a chance to turn words into action while we're here,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>This year's volunteers will work all summer and will receive a $500 stipend and a $1000 scholarship, provided in part by City Year's corporate sponsors, which include the Bank of Boston, Equitable Insurance and the Riley Foundation.</span></p> <p><span>Although this year's project is for the summer only, the program's founders says they hope to expand it into a full-year program beginning in 1989.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike the Peace Corps, City Year was founded in a Law School student's apartment, not the White House. The program is an independent, privately funded venture, and Khazei and Brown drew heavily on students and faculty at the Law School when creating it. Even President Bok participated, appraising and discussing a 10-page sketch of City Year which the two presented to him.</span></p> <p><span>City Year's working members see it as part of a tiny but potentially booming national youth service movement. The idea of a national youth service program has been bandied about for a long time and Brown and Khazei--roommates at the College and the Law School--both researched a national service bill while interning for members of Congress on Capital Hill. They and other proponents of national service now say that using a decentralized network of local groups like City Year might be the most practical way to realize their ideal.</span></p> <p><span>Berman, who wrote his government thesis on national service programs, has decided to make national service a career objective. Three summers ago, Berman worked with City Volunteer Corps, a New York City government program that is similar to City Year. That practical experience and his work on his thesis have convinced him that now is a most critical time for the national service movement, and he says \"City Year has the potential to be the model for other similar programs.\"</span></p> <p><span>As evidence of a need for a national public service program, City Year organizers point to what they call a crisis of values among young Americans. According to a study of college student trends from 1965 to 1985 done through University of California at Los Angeles, the values placed on money and power have skyrocketed in importance, while the \"helping\" values all plummeted in priority. As a result fewer and fewer people were entering fields like public service and education. These changing values also relate to increasing drug and alcohol abuse among those without jobs or college degrees, City Year organizers say.</span></p> <p><span>They posit that the United States needs more institutions to ease students' transitions from being irresponsible high-school kids to acting as adult citizens. City Year, Khazei says, \"is more than taking a year off; it is developed as a bridge between youth and adulthood.\"</span></p> <p><span>Khazei's vision of public service has inspired a wide variety of people to join the City Year team. The program has been able to tap a pool of recent college and professional school graduates to spur its fundraising effort. In fact, City Year was officially launched in late April at a spring benefit thrown by the Voluntary Fundraisers Association (VFA). VFA, which was founded by a group of young management consultants, teamed up with City Year to target more than 1000 people by mail, inviting them to attend a dance benefit or to contribute by mail.</span></p> <p><span>While City Year has a rare combination of committed people and original ideas, its organizers concede that they cannot make the program work without help. Knowlton warns, \"The big question is whether the private sector has the balls and the brains to get behind City Year.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Bok Leads Higher Education into Battle | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Presidential election years sometimes spark renewed activism and idealism in the electorate. Nowhere is this more true than in the offices of some of Harvard's top administrators.</span></p> <p><span>During the Reagan Administration, the once divine image of higher education has deteriorated rapidly. Consevative critics, led by Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, have attacked colleges and universities for their high costs, their poor teaching and their arrogance. The White House has followed word with deed by consistently proposing high cuts in higher education programs.</span></p> <p><span>But in the last year, President Bok has led a remarkable effort to take the initiative for educational reform away from such critics. Last July, in a speech delivered before a national conference of more than 500 educators, Bok called for a new partnership between universities, government and industry.</span></p> <p><span>Bok's speech marked a turning point in how higher education viewed its roles in society. He expressed a growing determination among universities to become involved as institutions in solving the nation's problems. Under his plan, Bok would use universities' expertise and resources to rebuild American economic competitiveness, foster equal opportunity for minorities, improve the quality of life and strengthen moral standards.</span></p> <p><span><b>Harvard Leads an Activist Charge</b></span></p> <p><span>Bok and Harvard have been instrumental in prodding the unwieldy higher education establishment into action. Sitting around at an NCAA presidents' conference several years ago, Bok became engrossed in a conversation with William C. Friday, President Emeritus of the University of North Carolina, about the roles universities could play in bettering society.</span></p> <p><span>This fall, the talks reached their timely fruition in the publication of the controversial Friday Commission report. The commission, which included 31 of the nation's foremost leaders in higher education, industry and labor, expanded on Bok's ideas. Entitled \"A Memorandum to the 41st President of the United States\", the report called on the next president to restore the close partnership that once existed between the federal government and higher education.</span></p> <p><span>The report also urged the future president to increase federal grants for student financial aid, provide incentives for research to help restore economic competitiveness and fund international studies programs.</span></p> <p><span>Friday, Bok and the commission received nationwide attention, as educators emphasized that the report marked the first time higher education had become directly involved in a presidential election. The day of the report's release, commission officials briefed presidential candidate Sen. Paul Simon (D.-Ill.), a long-time supporter of education. Friday and other members also met with Vice President George Bush a few weeks ago, while President Bok will soon discuss the report with Democratic front-runner Michael S. Dukakis.</span></p> <p><span>The report galvanized educators, who said it would put education on the forefront of every candidate's agenda. Harvard officials, especially Vice President for Government and Community Affairs John Shattuck, were instrumental in formulating, writing and publicizing the report.</span></p> <p><span>Predictably, administration officials and many editorial writers blasted it, saying that it represented nothing new from the education establishment. William Kristol, Secretary Bennett's chief of staff and a former Kennedy School professor, denounced the report as a mere \"wish list\" that sought \"more money to pay for more programs.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kristol's criticism \"misses the whole point and proves the validness of the document,\" Friday says. \"It's not a partisan document, and we did not choose sides.\"</span></p> <p><span>The purpose of the report was \"to create a more positive attitude towards what needs to be done,\" Friday says. \"We felt we were morally bound to speak out.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Spreading the Good News</b></span></p> <p><span>While education has taken a back seat in previous election years to more traditional domestic issues, voter concern about potential economic decline, equal opportunity, and the quality of life have propelled it to the forefront of every candidate's agenda this year.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think it is very real as an issue in the presidential campaign,\" Vice President for Government and Community Affairs John Shattuck says. \"There's no question that the electorate is recognizing the importance of education.\"</span></p> <p><span>Educators say that the Friday Commission's report has had a significant impact in putting education at the top of the candidates' agenda. They argue that the report has set the terms of the education debate this year, forcing the presidential candidates to come up with specifics instead of rhetoric, and putting conservative critics on the defensive.</span></p> <p><span>\"The impact [of the report] is fairly subtle and can be measured [by] to what extent it informs the policymakers\" for the Dukakis and Bush campaigns, says Robert Atwell, president of the American Council of Education. \"I have no doubt that it [the Friday report] will have an impact on [Bush's] subsequent pronouncements.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Our objective has been all along to inform the next president,\" says Charles Saunders, ACE vice president for governmental relations. \"I think the Friday Commission has helped shape the frames of reference and the parameters\" of the debate over education.</span></p> <p><span>\"Dukakis is also rethinking his positions on education,\" Saunders says. \"It's a long educational process with the candidates.\"</span></p> <p><span>Pointing to the lack of American competitiveness in international trade and the troubling decline in minority enrollment in the nation's colleges and universities, education officials say that America must now renew its committment to education.</span></p> <p><span>Higher education, they say, is the gateway to future opportunity in employment, and thus the federal government must increase expenditures on all forms of student aid to ensure equal access for all. \"Education is a metaphor for a lot of the challenges facing the country,\" Shattuck says.</span></p> <p><span>\"The need is as great as that document indicates, if not greater,\" Friday says. \"The cutbacks [in education] have been very costly for America.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"We're talking about very substantial expenditures\" that are needed for education, Friday says. \"The tragedy of it is that nobody's been saying these things before.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"We obviously have an interest in advancing that belief [that education is a national priority],\" Atwell says.</span></p> <p><span><b>Two Can Play That Game</b></span></p> <p><span>Presidential election concerns not only moved universities to action, but the Reagan administration as well. Ending seven years of bitter battles with universities on Capitol Hill, Secretary Bennett announced over the summer that the administration was abandoning its attempts to drastically reduce funding for crucial financial aid programs. The Administration then submitted a budget in February calling for major increases in education funding and most types of student aid.</span></p> <p><span>\"It took seven years, but it looks like the President has finally submitted a budget request we can live with,\" says Sen. Robert Stafford (R.-Vt.), ranking minority member of the Senate's Subcommittee on Education. The Administration's proposed budget, Stafford says in February, \"represents a major shift in policy.\"</span></p> <p><span>Education Department spokesman Loye Miller admitted that this dramatic turn-around in policy was aimed at helping Bush in the upcoming national elections. Bennett also believed his ideas were being ignored by Congress because of the its hostility toward his budget cuts, Miller says.</span></p> <p><span>Suddenly, the traditionally stormy budget process in Congress had become an unusually mild and tranquil one. The House and Senate passed budget resolutions that differed only slightly from the administration's requests.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, educators agree that the Friday report's powerful argument and its widespread acceptance by the presidential candidates has made it difficult, if not impossible, for the next president or the Congress to call for the deep cuts formerly advocated by Bennett.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's been called to the attention of all members of Congress,\" Saunders says. \"I'm sure it's helped [in the budget process].\"</span></p> <p><span>\"It's become clear to Congress that it's very important to support education programs,\" Shattuck says. The Friday Commission's report \"took the whole  approach [of calling for cuts] off the table.\"</span></p>"}

Bell contends that as long asappointments committees require their facultymembers to have had Law Review membership orclerkships with Federal justices--activities inwhich he says very few minoritiesparticipate--qualified minority professors will beexcluded from the faculty pool.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think it's going to be necessary to take onthe issue about what are our standards forhiring,\" Bell said after the protest. \"Do thestandards we've been following provide us with theLaw School we want?

{"title": "Automatic Transitions | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>O</b>N October 19, the stock market dropped more than 500 points, the largest one-day drop in Wall Street's history. The chief actors in that demise were small computers, automatically selling and buying, buying and selling, huge blocks of shares. Without any human making any particular decision, machines followed a logic of their own.</span></p> <p><span>As disengaged as people seemed to be from the crash's causes, they were equally disengaged from its consequences. This was not Black Monday all over again. It would not lead to bread lines, or people diving out of buildings. Capitalism would not come up for inspection. The ordinary person on the street was more likely to snicker than despair. Although thousands of small investors were hard hit, everyone identified losses with the young investment banker and his Gold Card.</span></p> <p><span>There was one major change, though. Computer trading would have to be severely curtailed. After all, it seemed a little odd to leave the nation's financial fortune in the hands, or memory banks, of desktop computers.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE crash was just one of many seemingly major, even cataclysmic, events which tugged at the fundamental structure of this country, and yet seemed to come from nowhere and to lead to a similarly indiscernible destination. We became, or perhaps continued to be, a nation of spectators. Like the stockbroker on The Street who watched a video display terminal handle millions of dollars, we passively watched large events pass before our eyes--perhaps commenting, as often as not, forgetting each one for the next piece of information that happened to come our way.</span></p> <p><span>A frightening bumper sticker slogan was born, characteristic of an attitude arising from the stultifying pattern of major events coming from and leading to nowhere. Kurt Vonnegut's deadening commentary on Dresden in <i>Slaughterhouse Five</i> \"So it goes,\" was transposed into: \"Shit happens.\"</span></p> <p><span>Serious shit to be sure, but still it just seemed to happen, and that was the point.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE Iran-Contra affair began with a sense that the fundamental precepts of the Constitution were under attack. The government appeared to be run out of the basement of the White House, covertly and with no acountability to anyone. American history dictates that such a major betrayal of public trust would be corrected--like the Watergate impeachment proceedings. After at this is a government by, for, and of the people.</span></p> <p><span>But it seems likely now that collective redemption will be replaced by collective omission. The president says he didn't know. The people who did know say they made a point of letting no one else know. And the one man who might be able to answer just who knew what is dead.</span></p> <p><span>Although the Senate Intelligence Committee found that the administration violated the Constitution, public scrutiny instead focused on what former Sen. John Tower's commission concluded--that the problem lay in something called a management style. Process, process, process.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, charges will likely be dropped against those who sold arms to Iran for hostages and diverted the profits to Nicaraguan contras in defiance of the law. If any of the prosecution's case relies on testimony made before T V, the court has hinted it would drop the entire case. The very fact that we heard the means by which the Constitution was subverted will now ensure that those who subverted it will not be punished.</span></p> <p><span>In the meantime a presidential campaign proceeded. The march to the Democratic and Republican conventions moved along as day follows night, with just as many surprises. There were occasional moments of thrill, when it seemed for a second that something significant might just happen. Pat Robertson beat George Bush, the Vice President, in Iowa. But then Bush won in New Hampshire and everywhere else.</span></p> <p><span>Jesse Jackson won in Michigan, where he drew widespread white support and beat the establishment candidate. Then came Wisconsin--more excitement, huge crowds, and whites saying that a candidate's color did not matter as long as he had something to say. But then Dukakis won, and kept on winning. The two who had the most money, the best organizations, and the least to say, found themselves on their way to the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Democracy ceases to matter when world events cease to matter, and that's the danger in the year that passed. Does something called the stock market matter to the economy when it can swing wildly with hardly any effect in the end? Does something called politics matter, if people can be elected for surviving rather than inspiring?</span></p> <p><span>Of course it does. At times, the cloud which seemed to make what happened both incomprehensible and irrelevant gave way to light. Judge Robert Bork found that intelligence is not enough in a democracy. The Constitution is not better for being played with like a Rubik's cube. Its power lies in its simplicity, its acknowledgement of the people's right to govern themselves.</span></p> <p><span>That message was easy to lose sight of in a year when so much happened that was treated like it meant so little. But for one brief period, people cared and cut through the minutiae--a Supreme Court seat was denied to a man who had spoken out against civil rights and denounced landmark equal access legislation. But in an irony that was befitting for the year, and surely gave pleasure to the cynics who invented that bumper sticker slogan, Bork was successfully followed by a jurist who, once confirmed, cast a vote challenging the core of federal civil rights doctrine.</span></p> <p><span>And so it went.</span></p>"}

For instance, Secord has said that testimony by North would show that money from U.S. arms sales to Iran belonged to Secord's business enterprise rather than the U.S. government as the indictment charged.</span></p> <p><span>Gesell said that \"any defendant should have considerable leeway to use indirectly...and possibly directly immunized testimony while defending the charges against him.\"</span></p> <p><span>He said the right to a fair trial \"cannot be preserved if any two defendants are tried together.\"</span></p> <p><span>Walsh is barred from using the defendants' immunized congressional testimony as evidence against them even though the defendants can use it themselves.</span></p> <p><span>Outside the courthouse, Walsh declined to comment on the judge's decision except to say that \"everyone realizes that four trials are more burdensome than one but the judge feels that that's a necessary requirement to protect the constitutional rights of all four defendants.\"</span></p> <p><span>Walsh declined to say whether North of Poindexter would be tried first. Gesell gave the prosecutor until Friday to make his decision.</span></p> <p><span>Gesell said defendants at criminal trials are \"afforded the powerful weapon of cross-examination, an essential part of our adversarial system.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Cross-examination is an effective means of ensuring the truth will prevail before a jury. It's a precious constitutional right,\" the judge said.</span></p> <p><span>\"Each of the three defendants who gave immunized testimony revealed information which one or more of the defendants considers helpful to his own defense if not exonerating some aspect\" of the case, Gesell said.</span></p> <p><span>\"Each defendant has contemplated using immunized testimony of other witnesses,\" Gesell said.</span></p> <p><span>The judge said Congress had a legitimate interest in conducting the hearings but he noted that the questioning of North, Poindexter and Hakim was \"in a highly accusatory context spiked with accusation of criminal impropriety.\"</span></p> <p><span>In arguments before the decision, Michael R. Bromwich, a lawyer for Walsh, said that publicity, while extensive, has often favored the defendants.</span></p> <p><span>He said \"Colonel North is on the lecture circuit and receives $20,000 a lecture. He certainly doesn't carry a stigma that would be prejudicial in this case.\"</span></p> <p><span>Any evidence of pre-trial prejudice, he said, should be tested \"against real people who step into the jury box.\"</span></p> <p><span>And he added, \"We don't think any political considerations ought to enter into fixing a trial date.\"</span></p> <p><span>Beckler argued that the Iran-Contra affair will play a major role in the presidential campaign, especially as questions are raised about Vice President George Bush's role.</span></p> <p><span>\"It would be a travesty to have this case proceed under that glare and spotlight,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>North, Poindexter, and two businessmen--Richard Secord and Albert Hakim--are charged in a 23-count indictment with conspiring to illegally divert profits from sale of arms to Iran to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Other counts involve obstruction of presidential and congressional investigations of the Iran-Contra affair, and theft of U.S. government property.</span></p> <p><span>Beckler said the Iran-Contra case, unlike Watergate, saw the public exposed to massive amounts of information from Congress and the Reagan administration that would not be admissible at trial.</span></p> <p><span>Gesell assured Beckler, \"If these men are convicted, they're not going to be convicted by pre-trial publicity. That can be assured.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "A Big Turn to Government on a Small Scale | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When Richmond, Virginia City Manager Robert Bogg came to the Kennedy School of Government for an executive training program in state and local government in 1980, he was a little disappointed in the program's emphasis.</span></p> <p><span>\"I felt that there were some good case studies of local government, but most of the focus was on state and federal issues,\" Bogg says. \"I felt there should have been more of a focus on local concerns.\"</span></p> <p><span>Until recently that sentiment was common among K-School students who wanted to work in state or local governments, according to several professors and former students. Since its inception more than 50 years ago, the Kennedy School has consistently emphasized national and international issues.</span></p> <p><span>Although the K-School still boasts many of the big-name scholars in international relations, the focus of the school's programs has shifted to include the less-glamorous fields of state and local government policy. With the announcement of a $15 million grant for the creation of the Taubman Center for State and Local Government, that shift has been firmly cemented into the Kennedy School's curriculum.</span></p> <p><span>When the Graduate School of Public Administration was renamed in honor of President John F. Kennedy '40 more than 25 years ago, its mission was defined as producing a new cadre of elite, well-trained public servants. For most of the past two decades that mandate had been translated at the Kennedy School to an emphasis on training federal civil servants.</span></p> <p><span>But by 1979, the school started to look into state and local issues, and then-defeated Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis was called in to head the fledgling program. Professors say that the program was a step in the direction of making state and local issues an integral part of the school's curriculum, but that they remained less important than national policy questions.</span></p> <p><span>Today, however, the Kennedy School's focus and its faculty--have changed. A number of K-School officials say that many of the best students are becoming interested in state and local government because there is more creativity in those areas. And many more faculty members are doing research into state and local policy questions.</span></p> <p><span>\"For a number of years, the Kennedy School has been doing more work in the area of state and local government,\" K-School Press Director Steven Singer says. \"There's a feeling among students and the faculty that most of the creativity in government comes at this level.\"</span></p> <p><span>To provide for the increase in student and faculty interest, philanthropist A. Alfred Taubman last month donated $15 million for the creation of the Taubman Center for State and Local Government, which will serve as the focus for the school's state and local programs.</span></p> <p><span>Professor of Urban Planning and Design Alan A. Altshuler was lured from his post as Dean of New York University's Graduate School of Public Administration to lead the new Taubman Center. The new director says that the center's creation indicates that the Kennedy School is committed to making the study of state and local government a full-fledged part of the school's overall program.</span></p> <p><span>And his colleagues say that Altshuler--who is regarded by many as one of the top political scientists specializing in local areas--is a symbol of that commitment.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's a real coup for us and a great fit for the center,\" said Professor Jose A. Gomez-Ibanez '70, who chaired the search committee which brought Altshuler to Harvard. \"We looked at an enormous number of people, but we didn't extend an offer to anyone but Professor Altshuler. It was one of those searches in which you comb the world.\"</span></p> <p><span>Altshuler has published widely, focusing his work on urban planning and transportation issues, but also touching on industrial policy. In addition, he has experience in the public sector, Altshuler served as Massachusetts Secretary of Transportation from 1971 to 1975.</span></p> <p><span>Colleagues say Altshuler's experience as a state official and as the chairman of MIT's Political Science Department will help the new center as it irons out organizational details.</span></p> <p><span>\"He's an articulate spokesperson for the mission of public service,\" said Dennis Smith, the NYU associate dean who helped bring Altshuler to New York. \"We were seeking a dean at a time when bashing public servants was a popular sport.\"</span></p> <p><span>In recent years, public service has become more and more popular, K-School officials say, and much of that interest has been directed towards the state and local levels. Twenty-three percent of Kennedy School graduates surveyed between 1981 and 1984 took their first job in state or local government.</span></p> <p><span>Many associated with the school attribute those numbers to the Reagan Administration's policy of reducing federal involvement in local affairs.</span></p> <p><span>\"Basically Washington shut down,\" says New York City Deputy Commissioner of Income Maintenance E. Allen Kraus, who received a Master's in City and Regional Planning from the K-School in 1978. \"Reagan came in and a lot of things changed. The job market shifted a lot and the fiscal condition of cities like New York and Boston improved. The K-School has to follow the market.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kraus, who says he tries to hire Kennedy School graduates because they are well qualified for public service jobs, lauds the increased interest in local public service among K-School alumni.</span></p> <p><span>\"It used to be so hard to come to Cambridge to recruit people from Harvard to work for the Department of Sanitation,\" Kraus says. \"Morgan Stanley would be in one office and the New York City Department of Sanitation would be in the other. It was a hard sell.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Teaching and Training</b></span></p> <p><span>The Kennedy School runs a number of programs for state and local public servants, including executive training seminars for newly-elected mayors and senior agency officials. Graduates of those programs say that they provide students with sufficient training to handle the tasks facing state and local government.</span></p> <p><span>\"You need quick problem-solving ability and you have to be what I call, `witty with numbers,'\" Kraus says. \"The basic skills that the Kennedy school teaches--statistics, applied economics and policy analysis--are very helpful.\"</span></p> <p><span>Amy Singer, a 1986 graduate of the school's mid-career Master's in Public Administration program and the acting assistant secretary of the Massachusetts Criminal Justice department, says that the K-School helped her prepare for work in state government, even though her courses didn't focus directly on state issues.</span></p> <p><span>\"Budgeting and dealing with the press are things that all government officials should know how to do, whether they be on the local, state or federal level,\" says Singer. \"The classes were very practical. I don't think I was well-equipped to deal with budgeting or with the legislature in Massachusetts or the press before I went to the Kennedy School. It gave me more confidence.\"</span></p> <p><span>Other graduates cite the ties to the school and the contacts they made while at Harvard as the most important part of their education.</span></p> <p><span>\"The benefits extended far beyond my time at the Kennedy School,\" Bogg says. \"It's given me an opportunity to interact with experts around the country to ask for advice. The contacts were very important.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Research</b></span></p> <p><span>But officials say that research, rather than teaching, will be the greatest area of impact at the Taubman Center. Several existing research programs will be incorporated into the new center, including the Ford Foundation Innovations program, which gives grants for outstanding state and local programs, and the Joint Center for Housing Studies.</span></p> <p><span>Altshuler says that the Taubman Center will be involved in two types of research--structural research on the organization and management of states and local governments and substantive research on the problems those governments face every day. He added that real world practitioners will be included in the substantive research.</span></p> <p><span>Graduates say they agree that current government officials should be integrated into the center's research to get feedback on problem-solving strategies for state and local policy issues.</span></p> <p><span>\"Some of the focus should be on specific urban problems,\" says Bogg, citing Black-on-Black crime as one of two major issues facing many urban communities. \"The other issue is growth--how growth in surrounding areas detracts from growth within urban centers.\"</span></p> <p><span>Gomez-Ibanez says the center's additional resources will allow him to continue his research on growth management in central cities and suburbs, noting that almost all the planning in Boston suburbs is under local supervision. Because this planning creates tension between neighboring areas, he says he is trying to find a strategy that \"promotes orderly development.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Social Programs</b></span></p> <p><span>But while Bogg acknowledges the need to study growth management, he says he hopes that the center will examine social and health issues important to cities.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's also very important that we learn how to deal with the ever-changing health and social issues like AIDS, teen pregnancy and literacy--as opposed to police protection and infrastructure,\" Bogg says. \"Those are important issues, but I am finding that we are getting more and more immersed in social concerns.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bogg, who was a city manager in the Midwest and California before assuming the Richmond position, says that these social problems are the ones with which he has been confronted in all of the cities where he has worked.</span></p> <p><span>\"There really is a common thread among the problems that we face in urban areas,\" Bogg says. \"I'm elated to find the funds are there for this kind of research.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "What Jesse Has to Do | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b>LTERNATELY hostile and accommodating in the past few weeks, Jesse Jackson has caused little trouble for his party. While he feigned tough stands on certain issues--namely South Africa--he promised to keep floor fights to a minimum. And while he expressed anger over not being consulted about the selection of the convention's keynote speaker, Jackson's appointment of well-respected politico Ron Brown to handle his convention strategy was widely seen as a gesture of good will towards the party.</span></p> <p><span>But while the party's mainstream is letting out an almost audible sigh of relief over Jackson's post-defeat behavior, for his part, Jackson seems to be making the least of his loss.</span></p> <p><span>His showing in the primaries and caucuses were by all accounts historic, and in real terms, impressive. Jackson fared better than Dukakis on Super Tuesday, winning a host of Southern states including Virginia. He won caucuses in states with small Black populations, such as Alaska and then, stunningly, Michigan--trouncing the Massachusetts governor by a nearly two-to-one margin there.</span></p> <p><span>For a brief time, the possibility of Jackson appearing on the ticket became a probability, and it even seemed possible that Jackson might enter the convention with the most delegates. As it is, he comes in with over 1000.</span></p> <p><span>The results of his campaign were sufficient to lead Hendrik Hertzberg to exclaim that Jackson has proved himself to be the most important Black leader in the country's history next to Martin Luther King, Jr. and Booker T. Washington.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT as each week passes, Jackson's influence seems to diminish. Both <i>The Boston Herald</i> and the <i>Globe</i> ran page one headlines telling of the way Dukakis' forces successfully trounced the Jackson delegates as the party's platform was drawn up.</span></p> <p><span>With a huge and loyal constituency, Jackson should be able to wield influence in this fall's election. But it seems ever more likely that the Jackson campaign of 1988 will go the way of the Jackson campaign of 1984--ceasing to matter after the convention. Unless he chooses to make a dramatic turn either in favor of or antagonistic to the party's all-but-certain nominee, Michael S. Dukakis, Jackson will be of no more significance in the fall election than the other five dwarves who failed to capture the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>In 1984, through the skillful negotiating tactics of Mondale's point man on the issue, Robert Beckel, the Jackson factor was effectively neutralized. The result was that Mondale got little in the way of fervent support from Jackson and his followers, but more importantly in the eyes of the Mondale campaign, he got little in the way of outright opposition. Talk of forming a third party ended up being just that.</span></p> <p><span>That pattern seems likely to repeat itself, so long as Jackson continues to follow the uncertain course he's on now. At first it seemed that he would accept his loss and merely try to contribute to the debate within the party. Then he switched, suddenly seeming to set his sights on being nominated to the vice presidency. Saying that he had no ranch, no ski-lodge, no oil company to run, Jackson let it be known that the vice presidency was hardly something he would categorically dismiss.</span></p> <p><span>But Jackson won't out right say that he wants to be vice president; he won't even say that should be asked to be vice president. All he says is that he should be seriously considered. And it now seems that he has been considered. No one, probably not even Jackson himself, thinks that he will actually be offered the job.</span></p> <p><span><b>J</b>ACKSON could choose to be a true thorn in Dukakis' side. He could issue ultimatums behind which his constituency could rally. He could lay out a sensible case for his being placed on the ticket--one that goes beyond his supporters' current contention, that since he came in second he has earned the spot, as if history backed up such an argument. He could defiantly challenge the party to open up, to acknowledge itself as the party of the left, just as the Republicans admitted they were the party of the right by nominating Reagan in 1980.</span></p> <p><span>By employing what he modestly calls Jackson action, Jackson could make himself a force in the fall election. If the Democrats failed to live up to his demands, he could take his followers on a run from the party--making the Democrats realize once and for all that Blacks no longer are Democrats first.</span></p> <p><span>Or he could do the more gracious thing, and perhaps in the end the more politically astute thing, going all out in support of Dukakis, mobilizing the hundreds of thousands of new voters he claims to have brought into the party. Jackson has long maintained that he is an important phenomenon in American politics because he has given people long locked out renewed--and in some cases, just plain new-faith in the system.</span></p> <p><span>But he has yet to demonstrate that this faith extends beyond his own fortunes. Are those willing to go to the polls to pull the lever for Jesse also willing to pull the lever for the Duke if Jesse gives them the go ahead? In 1984, the Jackson camp claims, the signal was never given because the nominee didn't deserve the support. But could it be that the real reason is that Jackson fears that he may fail to deliver the votes he says he has brought to the party?</span></p> <p><span>So far, Jackson has carefully refrained from putting himself on the line. He has proven that among Democratic candidates, virtually all Black voters prefer him. As it stands now, he regularly can be counted on to attract virtually all of the Black vote in the Democratic primaries, and to garner about 30 percent, at the most, of the total popular vote during the quest for the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Nothing shows yet that he can go beyond that figure, and until he proves that he will do something with the 30 percent support he seems to have a lock on, the party will have precious little incentive to answer to him.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Case Rowan Forgot to Make | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>he hottest story in Washington, D.C. during the past two weeks was not the Pentagon procurement scandal, but rather the controversy surrounding syndicated columnist Carl Rowan's shooting of a teenaged intruder who had been swimming in his backyard pool.</span></p> <p><span>The blatantly conservative <i>Washington Times,</i> which throughout the week had launched attacks on Democratic nominee-to-be Michael S. Dukakis in its front-page headlines and news articles, made the Rowan incident its lead story, with the obvious intent of discrediting not only a liberal, but a prominent writer for the paper it is supposed to compete with, <i>The Washington Post.</i></span></p> <p><span>In a brief respite from its efforts on behalf of the Bush campaign, the <i>Times</i> accused Rowan, who has written extensively in the past in support of such gun control measures as handgun registration, background checks on all aspiring buyers, and a \"cooling-off\" period, of being a hypocrite for keeping an unregistered handgun in his possession.</span></p> <p><span>And long-time Rowan haters, such as spokesmen for the National Rifle Association and right-wing zealot Patrick Buchanan, could not help but join the bandwagon, gloating at this apparent example of \"elitist, liberal hypocrisy,\" and label Rowan \"the Jacuzzi Bandit.\" They and others charged that Rowan has become the 1980s equivalent of the infamous \"limousine liberals\" of the 1970s, who while advocating busing as a means to integrate the public schools, quietly slipped their children off to Andover and Exeter.</span></p> <p><span>So now the NRA is preparing a massive mailing campaign with Rowan's face and his words plastered all over it. Their message, one assumes, is that if liberals like Rowan refuse to abide by the very gun control laws they advocate, the rest of us shouldn't either.</span></p> <p><span><b>R</b>ESPONDING to his critics, Rowan claimed in his weekly editorial column that there were no inconsistencies between his public statements and his private actions. In a rather incongruous justification of the episode, Rowan argued that although he supports strict gun control laws, he will continue to protect himself and his family (presumably with the same unregistered gun he used on the stoned youth) as long as society continues to tolerate widespread violent crime and drug abuse.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately for Rowan, that's the argument that the NRA has been making for years in its mailings, namely that our society cannot or will not protect average, law-abiding citizens from dangerous criminals, and that we must therefore defend ourselves, preferably, NRA gunslingers say, with our own Saturday Night Specials.</span></p> <p><span>However, if Rowan merely had reflected on his own past positions, he would have recognized that his recent action points not to the weakness of the case for gun control, but rather to its validity. For once again, the mere presence of a gun can lead not just a hot-tempered youth or a bitter spouse, but even someone as rational and intelligent as Rowan is, to pull the trigger irrationally.</span></p> <p><span>In his editorial piece, Rowan wrote that he kept the gun so that he would not be defenseless, \"naked to the druggies and crooks out there.\" Yet he ended up using it on some half-naked youth who was guilty of no more than trespassing and could have easily been dragged away, along with his female companion, by the cops.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, hindsight is always 20-20, and it's easy for talk show commentators and editorial writers to condemn Rowan when they have never been the target of death threats the way he has. Yet if the handgun had not been so readily available, what would Rowan have done? Probably called the police, which is what hindsight (and these very commentators) say he should have done in the first place.</span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>AD the gun not been there, Rowan would be the first witness for the prosecution in a misdemeanor court. Instead he now faces charges of assault with a deadly weapon and up to 10 years' imprisonment. Had he killed or permanently disabled the teenager, Rowan would obviously be facing far more serious charges, and the NRA would be a lot less enthusiastic in twisting the incident to fit its own absurd propaganda.</span></p> <p><span>Had the gun not been there, Rowan's reputation as an insightful and eloquent commentator would not be so suddenly called into question.</span></p> <p><span>Each year, thousands of lesser-known Americans learn the hard way that buying a handgun does not assure protection, but only future trouble. They buy handguns with the expressed purpose of protecting themselves, only to end up using them during family spats or lovers' quarrels with tragic, unforeseen results.</span></p> <p><span>Too often, a father cleaning his handgun accidentally fires it on his four-year-old son, or a six-year-old girl thinks the weapon is a toy and ends up killing her two-year-old brother and becoming permanently scarred by the experience. Too often, when a handgun is in the vicinity, a jilted boyfriend takes his frustration out on his ex-girlfriend, or on himself.</span></p> <p><span>Family members and friends of such victims probably regret, as Rowan should, the fact that the handgun ever was in the closet or on the bedroom table, so easy to reach at a moment's notice. Funny thing, the NRA never mentions these cases in its brochures.</span></p> <p><span>For although depressing to read and write about, such scenarios account for the vast majority of handgun-related deaths each year. Homicide figures in the District of Columbia, for example, show that the number of times a handgun has justifiably been used in self-defense during the last 15 years is no more than four. If you add the Rowan shooting, and that's a big if, it's a whopping five.</span></p> <p><span>Outside of such domestic accidents, there are plenty of other examples where handguns have not been used by law-abiding citizens acting in self-defense, but rather for far more malicious purposes which the NRA would rather not talk about. Several times this winter, Boston police were fatally shot or wounded during drug busts, or just while sitting in their squad cars.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>LL this is not to downplay the potential threat that Rowan may have faced, nor to condone the delinquency, arrogance, bad judgment, and lack of respect which the teenager showed towards the Rowan family at 2 a.m. that Tuesday night. It's just to suggest that Rowan, like the rest of us, would have been far better off without his handgun.</span></p>"}

And on, and on, and on...</span></p> <p><span>Yet, Reagan retains his popularity, despite the scandals and the crooks and the controversies.

Is it surprising that the last Republican candidate besides Bush was Pat Robertson?</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>OW, Bush is considering a number of possible running mates. Several factors--geography, ideology, personality--must be taken into account when Bush considers his potential Veep, but the overriding characteristic that Bush needs in a running mate is corruption.</span></p> <p><span>For most of his political career, Bush has been remarkably free from personal scandal. He's held high-level posts with the potential for incredible corruption--he headed the CIA. But there is no public record of impropriety for him. Even rumors of an extra-marital affair involving Bush have come to nothing. Where's the Miami Herald when you need it?</span></p> <p><span>If he keeps this up, he doesn't stand a chance of becoming president.</span></p> <p><span>Unless he takes advantage of Meese's reputation.</span></p> <p><span>Meese would be perfect as Bush's running mate. Geographically, Meese is from California while Bush is from everywhere else. Ideologically, Meese will be attractive to the hard-core right wing maniacs while Bush can appeal to moderates. Physically, Bush is skinny while Meese is a little chubby. Together they make a perfectly balanced ticket.</span></p> <p><span>And Meese can certainly provide the sleaziness to the ticket that Bush lacks. The attorney general has one of the more notable reputations for shadiness in the history of American government. And Meese got his reputation for sleaze the old fashioned way--he earned it.</span></p> <p><span>A Bush-Meese ticket would be unstoppable. Dukakis would need someone unbelievably sleazy to be his running mate to even compete with Meese.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately for the Democrats, they don't seem to have anyone sleazy enough for the job.</span></p>"}

And for some reason, I always remember how one sheep would head in one direction, and the others would follow. Eventually, following the leader led many of the animals to their deaths.</span></p> <p><span>This is the way some have pictured Blacks this year. They are said to be following the Rev. Jesse Jackson blindly, waiting on his every word. And that eventually, they too will be led to the shed to die a Republican death.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson garnered anywhere between 85 to 95 percent of the Black vote in the Democratic primaries. Political experts talk about his \"dedicated\" constituency and how they will be \"upset\" if Jackson is not offered the vice-presidency. The theory goes that if Jackson is not asked, his constituency will spend November at home, as they did the last two elections.</span></p> <p><span>They underestimate the voter who also happens to be Black. And its also looping them into one corner, as if they are a monolith, with all of the same interests at stake.</span></p> <p><span>There are some Blacks supporting George Bush. This is quite all right because Bush is standing for what they desire. And it is okay because Blacks need to exhibit more bi-partisanship anyway.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT with this bi-partisanship comes responsibility and weighing the differences between a Republican or Democrat victory. With an aging Supreme Court, whoever wins will probably be able to nominate several Supreme Court justices.</span></p> <p><span>Several liberal justices have gamely hung on for the past few years to avoid a Reagan sweep. Some Blacks now talk fatalistically of \"living through four years of Bush.\" If Jackson isn't on the ticket, they figure it would be better to teach the Democrats a lesson. But having Bush appoint the next few justices could be disastrous for the next 15 or 20 years, and the symbolic show of disgust hardly seems worth the consequences. It is dangerous when there are too many liberals or conservatives in the Court, and the ball is now in the conservatives' court.</span></p> <p><span>Blacks made a mistake seven, and then three years ago by not voting during the 1980 and 1984 Presidential elections. There appeared, at the time, to be reasons. In 1980, Blacks did not vote for Jimmy Carter because he did not come through on his promises to Blacks. This was after voting for the peanut man in 1976.</span></p> <p><span>When 1980 came around, Blacks, along with the rest of America, were fed up with Carter. While Blacks sat on their hands, the rest of America voted Carter out and Reagan into office.</span></p> <p><span>That turned out to be a major mistake on the part of most of Black America, which did not vote despite a gloomy prophecy on the part of Carter about a conservative Reagan court.</span></p> <p><span>And in 1984, there was another reason to sit at home. Apparently, the Democrats had treated Jesse Jackson poorly.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>NDIGNANT, Blacks sat out the election, and Reagan coasted.</span></p> <p><span>In both elections, there was the choice of the lesser of two evils, and Blacks allowed others to do the picking.</span></p> <p><span>The important thing is not so much that Blacks vote Republican or Democratic, but that they make sure they do not simply sit out an election. What happens when a lot of people vote? There is more speculation as to who will win. It would be much better if Blacks made both sides hustle for their votes, much in the way that politicians must now seek out the Hispanic vote.</span></p> <p><span>In Dallas on Wednesday, Bush pledged to put a Hispanic-American in his cabinet. In his highly publicized meetings with Black leaders last month, he failed to make a similar pledge.</span></p> <p><span>This could easily become a regular occurrence if Blacks continue to be one-dimensional voters. Blacks cannot throw all of their support to one side blindly. They must become more bipartisan, if not in the voting booth, then at least in theory.</span></p> <p><span>Blacks are in a similar situation to the last two elections. There is the pick between Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis, and Vice President George Bush.</span></p> <p><span>Some ask exactly what Dukakis has done for Blacks during the Massachusetts Miracle. Most answer that he has done little. And that may be true. A recent phone call to the \"Dukakis for President\" headquarters revealed that the Duke has no campaign literature pertaining to Blacks, none on his civil rights record, and nothing on what he had to say during the busing debacle in Boston during the early 1970s.</span></p> <p><span>But then there is the alternative. George Bush--and what he could <i>do to</i> Blacks. In order to satisfy his right-wing support, Bush would probably have to select a conservative Supreme Court justice. And with the possibility of several openings on an aging court, the prospect of twelve years of Reagan-Bush judicial appointments is scary.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>LACK voters have made a mistake by sitting out the last two elections. And once again, if instructed by Jesse Jackson, they may be tempted to sit at home again. But maybe the third time will be a charm. Sitting at home will leave the presidency in the hands of others. Whether or not if Jackson gives the go ahead, Blacks must vote all-out for the candidate with their interests at heart.</span></p> <p><span>And in this case, since there may not be such a candidate, vote for the one who will cause the least amount of damage.</span></p>"}

During hiseight-year term he cut state income and businesstaxes by $1 billion over three years and fired15,000 state employees. He further reducedgovernment expenditures by kicking what helabelled able-bodied adults off the welfare rollsand passing laws restricting the amount of medicalcost assistance.</span></p> <p><span>Thornburgh governed his state through one ofthe toughest economic periods in its history. Hardhit by economic recession and the decline of itssmokestack industries in coal and steel,Pennsylvania's unemployment rate reached seventhhighest in the nation when he took office.</span></p> <p><span>By encouraging national economic trends towardsservice-oriented and high technology businessesand creating job retraining programs, Thornburghis credited by his supporters with creating morethan 500,000 new jobs and reducing unemployment tothe point where Pennsylvania was at the nationalaverage. His voters seemed to approve, as theyreturned him to office by more than 100,000 votesin 1982.</span></p> <p><span>As the state constitution forbade him fromholding office a third consecutive term, theattraction of running in an election was not loston Thornburgh as 1986 approached. First he toyedwith the idea of running against incumbent ArlenSpecter (R-Pa.) for a U.S. Senate seat. Hisstatewide popularity would have made that electiona close one, but friendship with Specter and adesire to \"get out of politics for a while\" madeThornburgh change his mind, he said last summer.</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, he waited for a job that wouldallow him \"to gain a perspective on politics for awhile\" and \"keep in touch with my colleagues andthe issues of the day.

Allison '62, who has announced he will step down next year and is widely mentioned as a possible appointee in a Dukakis administration, made the transition from dean to political mogul last night. He was among the select guests of the Dukakis family seated in a VIP box located to the side of the podium. Allison and the Dukakis family and entourage, which numbered approximately 50, were joined in the box by the families of vice presidential candidate Sen. Lloyd M. Bentsen, Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk, and a rotating set of speakers, such as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54.</span></p> <p><span>But despite their VIP status, the group was not spared the effects of a cramped convention hall. When they were all assembled, 200-odd power-brokers were packed into the two-tiered box, which had seats for only 109.</span></p> <p><span>The advance people, who smoothly guide the candidates and their families through the convention, sometimes have to do more than organize. On Monday night during former President Jimmy Carter's speech, Kitty Dukakis, worn out from the excitement of the week, started nodding off to sleep. After consulting with other staff people, her advance woman made her way over to the governor's wife and gently poked her in order to ask a strategic question.</span></p> <p><span>Just politicos they're not in Atlanta, where the Democrats drew a large crowd of Hollywood luminaries to their gathering. Actors such as Judd Nelson, Rob Lowe and Linda Carter attended each session. And in a hall crowded with notables, the Hollywood stars still received an extraordinary amount of media coverage, as well as numerous requests for autographs.</span></p> <p><span>At midnight, after the convention sessions closed, most delegates and attendees were to be found at the enormous parties thrown every night by and for big names. For instance, on Monday New York Gov. Mario Cuomo threw a party for his and the Massachusetts delegates complete with Nathan's hotdogs and Steve's ice cream bars, and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young gave an elegant invitation-only party.</span></p> <p><span>Striking a very different tone than that of his stirring, though standard, public oratory in the Omni, the Rev. Jesse L.

Jackson outlined an agenda for capturing the attention of every state Democratic Party. He urged supporters to run for state party chairs, particularly in those states where Jackson took first or second in the presidential primaries.</span></p> <p><span>Noting that Illinois has not backed a Democrat for President since 1964, former presidential candidate Sen. Paul Simon predicted his home state will buck the trend and back Dukakis in 1988. \"I think we're going to win,\" he said, adding that the winning formula would be \"a combination of things: Dukakis plus George Bush.\"</span></p> <p><span>Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Col.) called on Harvard students to rally behind Dukakis in November. \"You've got to help us,\" the congresswoman told The Crimson. Schroeder said Bush is trying to convince Americans that \"Harvard is more elitist than Yale.\"</span></p> <p><span>Former Secretary of State and Maine Senator Edmund Muskie said \"only time will tell\" if the Democrats have really united behind Dukakis. \"When you use glue, you have to wait a few minutes before it hardens--we're waiting to see if it hardens,\" Muskie said.</span></p> <p><span>The former senator, responding to Bush's repeated barbs against the Dukakis-Harvard connection, had a question of his own. \"Is Harvard really as liberal as George Bush says?\" he queried, laughing.</span></p>"}

If the American people examine Bush's record of inaction, his silence on civil rights, the environment, education and the deficit from 1980 to 1987, they're liable to send him packing.</span></p> <p><span>Mike Dukakis and the Democrats also have shown that the Republicans have no monopoly on optimism.</span></p> <p><span>\"We believe there are no limits to what America can do,\" Dukakis told delegates at the convention. No longer the party of doom and gloom, the Democrats sound positive about the future. And they should: after eight years of Reagan, the Democrats appear headed for victory come November.</span></p> <p><span><b>R</b>EPUBLICANS will gather in New Orleans August 15-18 to present their case to the American people. Already trailing Dukakis badly, they desperately need to close the gap in the polls.</span></p> <p><span>The Democrats spent four days bashing Bush and it paid off. Bush is an easy target: a bumbling and boring rich boy with a penchant for looking silly. A man disliked by an amazing percentage of the American electorate, if the latest polls are to be believed. So what are the Republicans to do?</span></p> <p><span>Republicans will crow about low inflation and low unemployment. They'll claim full credit for the thaw in relations with the Soviet Union. And they'll talk a lot about the bad old days when Jimmy Carter was president and gas cost nearly a $1.50 a gallon.</span></p> <p><span>The Grand Old Party will try to wrap itself in the grand old flag. Republicans will talk a lot about patriotism and family values and \"moral strength\". They'll also pander to their special interest groups: fundamentalist christians, Right-to-Lifers and big business. Absent this year will be Ed Meese and the Teamster's union.</span></p> <p><span>They'll also pledge to never, ever raise taxes, and they'll try to blame Democrats for the deficits.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HEY can try to ridicule the Democratic nominee. But personal attacks on Dukakis could backfire. It's all right to mock Bush's rich ubringing, but political suicide to knock Dukakis' \"son of Greek immigrants\" appeal. Dukakis is a harder target for Republican barbs.</span></p> <p><span>Republicans will stress Bush's ties to the still-popular Reagan, his eight years of loyal service as vice president. They'll say America is bigger, better and stronger than it was in 1980. And, if they're smart, they'll nominate Kansas Senator Bob Dole as their vice presidential nominee.</span></p> <p><span>Trying to maintain their hold on conservative southern Democrats, Republicans may talk a lot about the Rev. Jesse Jackson, trying to frighten the millions of whites who opposed civil rights and backed Gov. George Wallace just 20 years ago. They'll keep referring to the Dukakis-Bentsen-Jackson ticket.</span></p> <p><span>The rest of the convention, the Republicans will try to paint Dukakis as an ultraliberal who is soft on crime and lacks foreign policy experience. They'll also bash Massachusetts, and they'll take a few cheap shots at Harvard liberals. And they'll use the \"L\" word a lot.</span></p> <p><span>But all of that is criticism, and the Democrats' covention, had it offered only that, would have been less than successful. If the Democrat's win this election because of that week in July, the credit will belong to the Duke's speech on Thursday night, in which he layed out a plan for the country, vague though it may be.</span></p> <p><span>Already trailing, the Republicans are running scared. Unless Bush discovers \"that vision thing\" real soon, the party's over for the Grand Old Party.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The South Rises Again | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HEY predicted that the South would rise again. Who would have thought that a liberal-easterner would have been the one to bring the South back to prominence. But it's pretty obvious that the Democrats, following Democratic presidential nominee Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' cue, went after the Southern vote. After viewing the Democratic convention, it would only make sense for the Republicans to follow the Democrats in wooing the South.</span></p> <p><span>The Southern strategy got its first start when Dukakis chose Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate. Was it a good choice? So far, it seems to have been a good move.</span></p> <p><span>The Democrats have never won the White House without winning Texas. Picking a Texan certainly enhances the Democrats chances of winning Texas and other parts of the South. Bentsen's conservative voting record should appeal to conservative white Southerners.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis has forced Bush to rethink his Southern strategy. It's bad enough that Bush has to work for the Southern vote, but now he has to campaign in Texas--a state that he thought was going to be a piece of cake. Now, Bentsen has taken a large slice out of that cake.</span></p> <p><span>While Bush hasn't come out with a real opinion on the Texan senator, it is assumed that he and the Republican party think highly of him. Bush criticized Walter Mondale for not picking Bentsen as his running mate in 1984. Bush is hoping that those words will not come back to haunt him.</span></p> <p><span>The Democratic party is hoping that history will repeat itself. In 1960, the Boston-Austin connection defeated the Republicans. They are also hoping that Bentsen can defeat Bush again. In 1970, Bentsen defeated Bush for a Senate seat.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE Democrats second plank in the Southern strategy was having Texas State Treasurer Anne Richards give the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention.</span></p> <p><span>Richards continued the attack by trying to show that Bush isn't a real Texan. Bush's voting residence is a room at the Houstonian, a hotel in Houston. This even prompted the head of the Texas delegation to call Bush a tourist.</span></p> <p><span>The Democratic Southern strategy is like a burning fire. Each time a Southerner spoke at the convention, it was like adding another log.</span></p> <p><span>The Democrats Southern attack didn't stop with Richards and Bentsen. Some prominent names included Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton and Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd. The Texas entourage included House Speaker Jim Wright, Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower, former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan and Congressman Mickey Leland. Leland and the highly respected Jordan seconded Bentsen's selection as vice president. Even the ending of the convention had a Texan taste to it. Singer Jennifer Holliday closed out the convention with the old rendition of \"America the Beautiful.\" And where is she from? You guessed it. She's from Texas.</span></p> <p><span>Are there any more influential Texans left?</span></p> <p><span>The Democrats even used Reverend Billy Graham, the most respected Southern evangical baptist in the United States. I guess they were looking to a higher source for help.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HIS Southern strategy probably did not go unnoticed by the Republicans, who have attracted conservative Democrats over the years. It's highly unlikely that they are willing to give up that support just yet.</span></p> <p><span>Bush is in a pretty good position. Since the Republican Convention is three weeks away, the vice president has some time to decide what area of the country he needs the most help in.</span></p> <p><span>It would not be surprising if Bush picked up on the Southern strategy. However, there aren't too many Southerners that Bush can choose from. But there are a couple of names that are prominent in the South: Reagan's former Chief of Staff Howard Baker and former Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole.</span></p> <p><span>Well the first thing is that he is from Tennessee. Another reason is because he is seen as a moderate. While he is a good friend of NAACP President Benjamin Hooks, it isn't for certain that he could bring in Blacks. Baker could bring in some moderate Democrats to the fold.</span></p> <p><span>The only problem with Baker is that he isn't recognized with one state or a certain constituency, and unlike Bentsen, he doesn't bring in a big state or a large constituency. Tennessee is a toss-up with or without Baker, and it doesn't have enough electoral votes to sway the election either way.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>USH'S other alternative down South is Mrs. Dole, the wife of Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.). Mrs. Dole, who is from North Carolina, could help in her homestate, South Carolina and Tennessee. She can also help Bush in the Midwest, in states such as Kansas (where she resides), Missouri and Illinois and Iowa. A third advantage of choosing Mrs. Dole is that she can bring in women voters. Especially since Dukakis didn't even consider putting a woman on the ticket.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's popularity in the South showed with convincing wins over his rivals during Super Tuesday. Bush swept every single state. Picking a Southerner will only enhance his popularity in that region.</span></p> <p><span>The Republicans will have to match the Democrats with a Southern strategy before and after the their convention next month. If the Republicans are able to maintain their popularity with the Southern voters, Dukakis would have to change his vice-presidential selection to Robert. E. Lee to have a chance.</span></p>"}

He urged Iran and Iraq to accept a year-old, U.N. cease-fire resolution immediately.</span></p> <p><span>\"The critical issue confronting this body is not the how and why of Iran Air 655,\" Bush declared. \"It is the continuing refusal of Iran to comply with Resolution 598, to negotiate an end to the war with Iraq and to cease its acts of aggression against neutral shipping in the Persian Gulf.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I will not dignify with a response the charge that we deliberately destroyed Iran Air 655,\" the vice president.</span></p>"}

They describe the United States as Texas and the other 49 colonies. When Democratic nominee Gov. Michael S. Dukakis picked Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen to be his running mate, this gave Texans an option on two Texans: Vice-President George Bush or Bentsen?</span></p> <p><span>Texans should be happy--anyway it goes, we win. I'm a Texan, too, y'all. But for Black Texans, it may not be so clear cut. Will Blacks still support Dukakis and Bentsen even though the Rev. Jesse Jackson isn't on the ticket? Here's what Black Texans say:</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't like the way they treated Jackson,\" said Jennie Jarmon, a cosmetologist in Houston. \"I think he's a jack-ass for not picking Jackson. He had so much support behind me. He would have been a fine addition to the ticket.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I think Dukakis could have treated Jackson better,\" said Jane Everage, a chiropractor in Houston. \"I'm still going to support the ticket. I think Blacks will have to decide whether or not they will support the ticket without Jackson.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Dukakis should have talked to Jackson more,\" Prarie View A&amp;M student Michael Randon said. \"I think he made a bad decision by not picking Jackson. Jesse has proven that he's qualified for the position.\"</span></p> <p><span>Jackson supporters are complaining about the way Jackson found out. A reporter in the airport informed Jackson of Dukakis decision to pick Senator Bentsen as his running mate. Dukakis said that he phoned Jackson but the reverend was already on a plane going to Washington.</span></p> <p><span>Twenty years from now, some one may look back and ask: was it a lousy phone call that may have lost the election for the Democrats?</span></p> <p><span><b>J</b>ACKSON and Dukakis' friendship has been going down hill since they had dinner at the governor's home on July 4th.

I guess, in a way, it's good that Jesse wasn't on the ticket. Some racist idiot may have tried to kill him.\"</span></p> <p><span>Some Blacks are saying that Jackson deserves to be on the ticket because he finished second in the primary. In 1984 Gary Hart finished second behind Walter Mondale, but the Colorado Senator was not selected.</span></p> <p><span>There are also questions about whether or not Jackson could function as President if something tragic were to happen to Dukakis.</span></p> <p><span>\"I didn't expect Jackson to be on the ticket,\" said Doctor Frank Jones, Professor of Political Science at Texas Southern University. \"The interviews of Jackson by Brountas was a way to placate Jackson supporters. I'm just concerned that Dukakis people could have been so callous with Jackson.\" But he too adds, \"I think most Blacks will still vote Democratic.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think Blacks are smart enough to vote in November,\" Eddie Starks said. \"I don't they will sit out just because Jackson isn't on the ticket. My first choice was Jackson as vice-president, but I've heared some good things about Senator Bentsen.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>OME Texans understand the strategic move made by Dukakis, and the fact that Jackson may hurt the ticket. \"I think Dukakis made a pretty good decision,\" Rice student David Jackson said. \"He has to get the conservative Democratic vote also. Besides Jackson has too many negatives. All he would do is hurt the Democrats' chances in November.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Jesse doesn't have any experience,\" Steve Williams said. \"The guy has never help public office in his life. He doesn't know anything about balancing a budget. Jackson seems obsessed about being the vice-president. He'll probably call Bush and ask to be his running-mate.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't know enough about Bush or Dukakis yet,\" Lamar student Kim Starks said. \"I'm not going to support Jesse just because he's Black. Jesse is a preacher, not a politician. He's not qualified. It's really stupid to vote for Jesse just because he's Black. He's a joke. He's never held any type of political office. He should take his bible back to the church, not the White House.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bentsen has established some civil rights credentials early in his political career. The senator voted against the poll tax in 1949, a device used in the South too help disenfranchise Blacks by forcing citizens to pay for the right to vote.</span></p> <p><span>\"He's a fair senator,\" McElroy said. \"He's been fair to minorities in Texas. He has a long-standing civil rights record. I think he's going to be a good vice-president.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't know much about Bentsen, but I hear he's pretty good,\" Randon said. \"I think Blacks will still support the Democratic ticket.

Texas' Republican Senator Phil Gram predicted that Texans will support a Texan president instead of a Texan Vice-President any day.</span></p> <p><span>Well, Mr. Gramm I have to disagree. Bush is from several states: Massachusetts (where he was actually born), Connecticut, Maine and Texas. He's registered as a Texan. His address is a room at the Houstonian Hotel. Recently, Texan Democrats had bologna sandwiches in his hotel room, because its bologna that he is from Texas.</span></p> <p><span>\"Bentsen is a traditional Texan conservative,\" Professor Julian Davis, chair of the Public Affairs Department at Prarie View A&amp;M and a Jackson delegate. \"His positions are more in line with Republicans. He's really popular in Texas. He has made some attemps to recognize the New South.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Bentsen will help Dukakis in Texas,\" Davis said. \"I will go out on a limb and predict that Dukakis will carry Texas because of Bentsen.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm not that crazy about Jesse Jackson anyway,\" Ray Ingram said, an engineer in Houston. \"I'm going to vote for Dukakis because \"I'm a Democrat.

Dukakis went with the odds, picking a very popular senator from Texas. Jackson had an incredible campaign.

{"title": "This Isn't 1960, Duke | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>HEN Gov. Michael S. Dukakis chose Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas as his running mate last week, he harkened back to the presidential campaign of 1960 and proclaimed that the \"Boston Austin\" connection was back in the running. Dukakis, like every smart politician, is seeking to capitalize on the mythic stature that Americans accord President John F. Kennedy '40 by reminding voters of the successful Massachusetts-Texas combination that won the White House for the Democrats in 1960.</span></p> <p><span>But by resurrecting the memories of JFK and LBJ, Dukakis is living in the past while ignoring history in the making. The Rev. Jesse Jackson will not be ignored--as is becoming more and more evident with the malestrom of media coverage and the general furor surrounding his role at the convention. Dukakis, with his penchant for reclaiming the spirit of Camelot for his presidential campaign, is overlooking the historical significance of this year's Democratic race for the White House.</span></p> <p><span>This presidential campaign, unlike the one in 1960 or any other, has been marked by the exceptional showing and powerful populist appeal of Jackson, the first Black politician ever to do so well in the primaries. Jackson won over 7 million votes in the extended primary season that culminates this week at the Democratic convention in Atlanta--that showing, while not quite enough to outrun Dukakis for the nomination, is a historic one nonetheless.</span></p> <p><span>And the message that Jackson's campaign sent to millions of first-time voters and traditionally undervalued minority groups was that they, too, are entitled to a voice in the political process. It was a classic lesson in the politics of empowerment--though the main player, a preacher and civil rights activist from Chicago, was hardly your standard political figure.</span></p> <p><span>But as Jesse Jackson gained stature and popularity during the course of his campaign, Dukakis gained votes-and the money necessary to run his effort. Jackson ignited the crowds, his speeches were television magic, he kissed babies and hugged supporters. Meanwhile, Dukakis talked about economic opportunity and the Massachusetts Miracle, columnists wrote admiring pieces about his campaign money machine, and voters pulled enough levers in voting machines to put the Massachusetts governor firmly in the winner's seat.</span></p> <p><span><b>J</b>ACKSON has been the spark that ignited the Democratic race for the presidential nomination; Dukakis has been the cautious, solid candidate. And by choosing Bentsen, Dukakis once again emphasized the calculated rationality that is the hallmark of his personal style.</span></p> <p><span>The facts are that a Democratic candidate has not won the presidency without Texas in 100 years, that the party's liberal wing had their day in San Francisco in 1984 and proceeded to lose 49 states, and that as Arkansas Sen. Dale Bumpers said, \"I'd rather run against motherhood than Lloyd Bentsen in Texas.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis must cement his place as the nominee, the great hope of his party. And as he told reporters before he left for Atlanta, \"there's no room for two quarterbacks.\" Dukakis has made his decision for the second spot, and now he must unite his party and attack the main prey--Vice President George Bush.</span></p> <p><span>But this unification should not come at the expense of Jackson, whose energetic awakening of the liberal wing of the Democrats could prove to be a huge asset for the party in November.</span></p> <p><span>To Dukakis, though, the winner wins and the loser keeps quiet. Dukakis has been treating Jackson as a typical vanquished rival for the nomination, as his failure to notify Jackson before the news of Bentsen's selection makes clear. In his mind, there is no reason to make an exception.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson, vowing to \"never surrender,\" is intent on changing the governor's mind. Jackson is asking for unprecendented presence in the campaign, for a liberalized campaign platform and for an almost complete integration of his campaign staff with Dukakis'. And how Dukakis decides to act on Jackson's requests will say a lot about how Jackson is perceived by the soon-to-be Democratic nominee.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>F Jackson is to be just another beaten primary opponent, then Dukakis will likely downplay the requests, throwing the obligatory crumbs of respect to Jackson. But if Jackson is considered in light of the important role he has played--and the historic impact his campaign has had in Democratic politics--then Dukakis may take his opponent's demands more seriously.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis has many practical considerations to face as he prepares to accept the Democratic nomination, but he and his aides must tread a delicate line as they balance strategic concerns with historic ones. Icons like Kennedy don't need to be resurrected from the glory days of the Democratic past while modern-day political giants like Jackson stand ready in Atlanta to do battle for the ticket.</span></p> <p><span>There is some truth to the hackneyed wisdom that says \"in remembering our past, we neglect our future.\" Jackson has lent personal magnetism and liberal compassion to an otherwise dry Democratic race; he has the faithful following of an important political constituency and some strongly-held policy positions that would only enhance Dukakis' chances in November. Dukakis should forget about the 1960 election returns and concentrate on the ones that count four months from now.</span></p>"}

Dukakis and Vice President George Bush campaign on the need to wage an effective \"war on drugs,\" several bills are pending in Congress which would deny federal aid to colleges and students unless they are deemed drugfree.</span></p> <p><span>Support is growing in Congress for legislation which would strip federal financial aid from students convicted of using or selling illegal drugs. The House has already passed several versions of a provision that would allow the government to cut off aid to recipients of federal contracts or grants whose employees are convicted of using or selling drugs at work.</span></p> <p><span>And Democratic leaders in the House are backing another anti-drug proposal that is more specific about the conditions under which colleges and other recipients of federal funds could lose money. The bill would require employees whose work was supported by a federal grant or contract to sign a statement that they would not abuse drugs on the job and to notify their employers within five days if they were convicted of doing so.</span></p> <p><span>Higher education officials say they oppose the provisions of the pending legislation. They charge that such measures represent election-year politicking and would fail to have any substantial effect on the drug problem.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, they say that the legislation would be unenforceable since the government does not keep a comprehensive list of people who have been convicted for drug-related offenses, making it impossible for colleges to check whether a student aid applicant has a record of drug-related offenses.</span></p> <p><span>But while supporters of the legislation admit that it will not solve the drug problem by itself, they say it sends a powerful signal that drug abuse will not be tolerated.</span></p> <p><span>\"The government has got to give a signal that an individual takes a risk using drugs, and that he cannot expect thepublic to subsidize [such use],\" said an aide toRep. Thomas Coleman (R-Mo.), who hasunsuccessfully sought to insert an anti-drugstipulation into a House bill on GuaranteedStudent Loan default.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard officials said they disagree with thepending legislation, because it is not anappropriate way to combat drug abuse. \"I thinkit's misguided,\" said Director of Financial AidJames Miller. \"It is a lot of election-yearpolitics, and it's tough for a congressman tooppose\" such anti-drug legislation.</span></p> <p><span>Miller said that this was the type oflegislation that \"looks good [to voters] and wouldbe virtually unenforceable.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"It's unclear whom this is targeted to,\" saidan aide to Rep.

Bennett, who in the past has criticizedcolleges for not doing enough to combat drug abuseon campus.</span></p> <p><span>A spokesman for Bennnett said that it would bebetter to help colleges enforce their ownanti-drug policies than for the federal governmentto become involved. The Education Department iscurrently working with officials from about 20universities to establish voluntary standards theycould adopt to reduce drug abuse on campus, hesaid.</span></p> <p><span>\"We really don't think that [denying aid tostudents convicted of drug abuse is] a good idea.No proposal that has been made has at all beenable to take into account situations in whichsomeone got involved in drugs, served some time,and yet was straight as far as drugs areconcerned\" by the time he or she went to college,said Loye Miller, Bennett's press secretary.</span></p> <p><span>College officials said they also oppose theprovisions of the legislation requiring employeesto sign statements that they will not use drugs onthe job. They questioned the legality of such astipulation, saying that a pledge might poseconstitutional problems if the courts interpretedit as requiring self-incrimination.</span></p> <p><span>\"It begins to smell a little like a loyaltyoath, and that bothers me,\" Harvard's Miller said.He noted that federal law already requires allcolleges and universities to have a comprehensivedrug policy in place in order to receive federalfunds.</span></p> <p><span>But Saunders said that the ACE wouldn't objectto similar provisions that did not directly punishuniversities or departments for their employees'potential drug use.</span></p> <p><span>\"We don't see why higher education should beexempted from federal workplace provisions,\"Saunders said. \"Colleges have a reponsibility tomake it clear that drug use in the workplace won'tbe tolerated.</span></p>"}
{"title": "\"Cuba's Next to China, Right?\" | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>MAGINE not being able to answer any of the questions in the Blue category--Geography--of Trivial Pursuit. Imagine being asked to find the Pacific Ocean on a map and pointing to the English Channel instead. Imagine confusing the Soviet Union's location with Botswana.</span></p> <p><span>It may seem unlikely, but according to a recent National Geographic Society survey of nine countries, Americans ranked at the very bottom in their knowledge of geography. When asked to identify 16 spots on the map, including the United States, the Soviet Union, the Pacific Ocean and the Persian Gulf, American adults averaged 8.6 correct answers. Swedes ranked the highest, with 11.6 points.</span></p> <p><span>Geography, much to the bane of schoolchildren and delight of their teachers, has always been considered one of the staples of elementary school education. By learning about the different countries in the world, it was rationalized, children would better understand America's own diversity of heritages.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, that pedagogical approach was thrown out with mandatory school prayer and other relics of the conservative, unmissed past. And the results of changes in educational direction are glaringly obvious from the poll's findings: American adults may have scored poorly on the survey, but Americans in the 18 to 24-year-old category did even worse, placing last out of nine countries, including Mexico, Canada, Great Britain and Japan.</span></p> <p><span>As Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president of the National Geographic Society, said, \"Our adult population, especially our young adults, do not understand the world at a time in our history when we face a critical economic need to understand foreign consumers, markets, customs, foreign strengths and weaknesses.\"</span></p> <p><span>Knowledge of geography is the building block upon which students can begin to understand America's position within a larger framework of countries. It is essential for economic reasons and for political ones.</span></p> <p><span>But young Americans aren't being taught to understand the world around them; they are growing up secure in the supremacy that ignorance breeds. It's easy to accept unquestioningly the xenophobia of \"we're number one\" if you can't even locate the competition on a map. Mom, baseball and apple pie thrive on a single-minded vision of the United States, one which hardly acknowledges the vast majority of the world's population.</span></p> <p><span>Much has been written about the narrow concepts of the so-called American Dream, about the pressing need to reform America's educational system, about the ignorance of its schoolchildren. And as the National Geographic survey underscores, most of it is true.</span></p> <p><span>American schools teach fewer foreign languages than those in other countries, they teach less non-American history, they teach less science and math. And these failings in the educational system have important consequences for America's political and economic relations with other countries.</span></p> <p><span>Geographical ignorance is often accompanied by political naivete, as demonstrated by a series of more in-depth questions which the pollsters asked over 1600 Americans. The survey found that not more than half of adult Americans know that the Sandinistas and contras are fighting each other in Nicaragua; most placed the conflict in Iran, Lebanon or Afganistan. In addition, 50 percent of Americans could not name a single member of the Warsaw Pact; 10 percent erroneously placed the United States as a member of the Soviet bloc.</span></p> <p><span>If Americans cannot even make basic distinctions about the world's political makeup, then they are even less likely to have any understanding of the complex foreign policy issues which affect them.</span></p> <p><span>In Congress, senators and representatives debate the fine points of giving aid to the contras (the ones fighting in Nicaragua, that is). Meanwhile, their constituents are hard-pressed even to identify the strife-torn Latin American country on a map, never mind explain what the U.S. government's policy is toward the contras.</span></p> <p><span>It is this kind of ignorance that furthers the division between society's governing elite and the citizens it seeks to serve. When the American education system produces geographical--and political and scientific--illiterates, elected officials become much less accountable to their constituents and much more liable to take reckless foreign policy stances. While President Reagan and his administration were trading arms for hostages in Iran, most Americans were unable to locate Iran on a map.</span></p> <p><span>Things may change after the presidential election in November, and it is clear that they have to if the U.S. is not to continue handicapping the students it is supposed to educate. Both candidates, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and Vice President George Bush, have spoken out on the education issue and on the need to improve the quality of teaching that goes on in the public schools.</span></p> <p><span>Yet there is no need to return to a 1950s-style classroom in order to improve Americans' familiarity with the world outside their borders. Moral values, a la Alan Bloom and former Education Secretary William J. Bennett, are not the prescription to the country's educational woes.</span></p> <p><span>If anything, the National Geographic survey results highlight the danger of looking back at the expense of anticipating the future. As populations continue to soar in the Third World, the U.S. will represent a smaller and smaller proportion of the world's population. And economically, the Far East has already achieved unparalleled influence that will only continue to grow.</span></p> <p><span>To continue to educate Americans as though \"Made in America\" labels were the only ones in the products they buy, as though English was the primary language of the billion-plus people in the world, would be a huge disservice to the national interest.</span></p> <p><span>But it will take much more than an \"Education President\" to revitalize a system of education that produces 18-year-old high school graduates who don't know where to find the U.S.--or the Soviet Union, Japan, Canada, France, Mexico and South Africa--on a map.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Search for Czars | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>S</b>OME time ago, it became part of the conventional wisdom to suggest that the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson would make an ideal Drug Czar. It is a position which has never existed in the past, and the responsibilities of the Czar are necessarily vague.</span></p> <p><span>At first, the idea of creating the position seemed more a way of dealing with the Jackson factor than of dealing with drugs. Faced with an unpredictable and ambitious rabble-rouser, the Democrats didn't want Jackson on the ticket and weren't too excited about the prospect of having him in the cabinet. What to do? Create a positon where he could, under the auspices of the government, travel from school to school, reminding students to put \"hope in their brains\" instead of \"dope in their veins.\" It would be harmless.</span></p> <p><span>But maybe there was more than cynicism behind the idea. The drug problem--some would say hysteria--has risen to the top of the public's list of concerns, and polling shows that Americans view drugs as the number one problem facing the country. With this concern in mind, the Republicans have been thinking about naming a Drug Czar of their own.</span></p> <p><span>According to <i>New York Times</i> columnist Tom Wicker, the GOP's man for the job is none other than Major League Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth. He has made a name for himself by taking a tough stand against major leaguers who abuse illegal substances. He has gone so far as to try to require mandatory drug testing of all purveyors of the great American pastime.</span></p> <p><span>That Ueberroth and Jackson would be the two people, and so far as I know the only two people, who have been named as potential Drug Czars reveals much about how we view the drug problem in this country.</span></p> <p><span>One man represents the lower-class, largely Black citizens who see the drug problem arising from economics. The other speaks for the wealthy, largely white portion of the country whose safety is threatened by drugs and drug-related crime. But such distinctions are usuallly glossed over when the drug problem is put up for discussion. Just the other day, two prominent experts on the drug epidemic appeared on a local television show and concurred that drug use was not a political problem, but rather a \"people problem.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE Just Say No campaign of Nancy Reagan underscores the determination with which Americans, or at least some Americans, attempt to frame the drug problem as a national one, affecting all people in the same way. If a wealthy suburban teenager becomes addicted to cocaine, it is simply part of the drug problem. So too if inner-city ghetto kids end up killing each other over a crack sale. Just Saying No will do the trick.</span></p> <p><span>But in truth, these two stories of drug usage are unrelated, and the importance of drugs in either of these tragic scenarios is more than likely overblown. The wealthy, suburbanite cocaine addict more often than not is succumbing to largely psychological pressures: stress, family problems, etc. The crack dealers in the inner-city are acting largely out of sociological pressures, and more fundamentally than that, economic ones. In both cases, drugs hardly seem to be the source of either problem, they are merely an avenue of expression, dangerous though the path is.</span></p> <p><span>A story in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> many months ago chronicled an investigation by New York City police into a drug-related murder. The suspects involved were relatively young, and the detectives emphasized that the reason for the kids' involvement stemmed from the tremendous amounts of money available to those who chose to enter the drug trade.</span></p> <p><span>Locked in a world with few options, in which chances of financial success are few and far between, drug dealers in effect become role models for some in the inner city. The grand funeral that honored the death of one of the drug kingpins in the Oakland area merely points to that reality.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson speaks to this problem. He presents public policy proposals to increase the range of options that inner-city youths would have. In other words, for Jackson, the drug problem can only be solved by a national effort to revitalize major urban centers. That means better housing, education and job opportunities. In his words, \"daycare and childcare on the frontside of life, instead of welfare and jailcare on the backside of life.\"</span></p> <p><span>Now it is true that Jackson's famed \"I Am Somebody\" speech (\"my mind is a pearl; I can do anything in the world\") has proven to have a universal appeal. And his speeches at suburban high schools in which he asks those who have used drugs to admit it and come forward have been powerful.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, his son Yusef spoke to the latter aspect, when in his introduction to his father's address at the Democratic National Convention he said that too many members of his generation have chosen to spell \"relief D-R-U-G-S rather than L-O-V-E.\"</span></p> <p><span>But what Jackson omits in his discussion of the drug problem is just as revealing. He almost never mentions drug rehabilitation programs, or even the concept of rehabilitation. If anything, he's more likely to rely on something like conversion, in which the sin is confessed, forgiven and then washed away.</span></p> <p><span><b>J</b>ACKSON also omits the law and order dimension of the drug problem. For many Americans, drugs and crime are synonymous. When they say that drugs are the number one issue, it is not altogether different from the elections of the late 1960s when law and order was the chief issue of the day.</span></p> <p><span>Ueberroth speaks for all those who look on the drug problem in this context. For him, what is needed is a get-tough policy. Vice President George Bush's well-known taunting of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis for opposing the institution of the death penalty for drug kingpins highlights this attitude. As the baseball commissioner, Ueberroth has made a point of taking a tough stand against ballplayers who use drugs.</span></p> <p><span>As a country, we are inclined to downplay differences, particularly when it comes to questions of class. Historians have shown that while the movement for temperance was framed as a national moral problem, it was in many ways a class phenomenon. And the resulting temperance laws amounted to an effort by the middle class to assert its hegemony.</span></p> <p><span>The drug problem of today is similarly being treated as a general more question on which all Americans should be able to agree. But such is not the case. If the country is unanimous in crying out against the scourge of drugs, Americans see the problem differently.</span></p> <p><span>At present, the two candidates for the post of Drug Czar represent two very distinct attitudes towards the problem of drugs. The one seeing in it the results of economic violence. The other finding evidence of permissiveness gone awry and the need for a return to law and order. And in the divergence between Ueberroth and Jackson lies the chasm, be it of class, color or principle, which separates most of America today.</span></p>"}

Then you need to pick up a copy of the Presidential Biblical Scoreboard, a publication designed to help the God-fearing \"Christian majority\" defeat the forces of evil: the \"liberal minority.\"</span></p> <p><span>Just who is the liberal minority? A tiny and perverted sliver of the American electorate who support a world government, who believe Jesus Christ was a \"moral teacher, a fanatic, or a hoax,\" and who \"protect the criminal\" instead of the victims of crime. These enemies of America's traditional values include the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Education Association, Planned Parenthood and the National Organization for Women.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>IBLICAL SCOREBOARD (BS) claims to be a \"nonpartisan nonsectarian\" publication. Its executives deny that it is pro-Republican, though it seldom says anything good about the Democrats. \"Scoreboard recommends to its readers that they vote for the candidates which best represent Judeo-Christian values--those that are pro-family, pro-morality, pro-traditional values, pro-freedom, pro-biblical.\"</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately for Democrats, their standard bearers apparently oppose all of the above, plus apple pie and motherhood. Not a single Democrat receives passing marks in the latest issue.</span></p> <p><span>Oddly enough, the man who scores lowest on the Biblical Scoreboard is a Black Baptist minister, the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jackson, the only presidential hopeful to quote Jesus Christ at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. Jackson, the man who called on the nation to put principles ahead of politics, the preacher who--like Christ--challenged his fellow sisters and brothers to feed the hungry and clothe the naked.</span></p> <p><span>But Jackson draws the ire of Biblical Scoreboard because he is \"anti-military superiority,\" anti-Star Wars, and he's a liberal. Quoting an unnamed political analyst, Biblical Scoreboard says Jackson would be \"the first Marxist President of the United States.\"</span></p> <p><span>Jackson also angers the boys from Biblical Scoreboard because he's pledged to raise taxes on a group Jesus was never real fond of: the rich. This upsets Biblical Scoreboard, which says taxing the rich is \"anti-family.\"</span></p> <p><span>What sort of men get high ratings from this publication? Few score higher than Sen. Jesse Helms (R-North Carolina). Helms is the biggest opponent of civil rights in the Senate, and the strongest backer of (anti-family?) government handouts to (anti-moral?) tobacco producers, a fact Biblical Scoreboard never reveals. The magazine also doesn't mention Helms' record of opposing programs which help the poor and the sick.</span></p> <p><span>Of the presidential aspirants the white Baptist--television evangelist Pat Robertson--is tops. Robertson is right on every \"biblical, family, moral freedom issue\" save one. The preacher misses a perfect score because he favors imposing \"sin taxes\" on those who indulge in vices. Though arguably laudable, this is nonetheless an endorsement of higher taxes, something God and Biblical Scoreboard oppose.</span></p> <p><span>Biblical Scoreboard wants Christian men and women to \"represent God in the political arena.\" \"As the prophets of old confronted the kings with God's standards, we must take a stand for God through writing letters, voting, and informing others when the government makes decisions on moral issues,\" Biblical Scoreboard says.</span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>IDWAY through the publication, Biblical Scoreboard says its survey is \"not intended, nor implied, to be a statistical judgment of a person's personal moral behavior or relationship with God.\" Only an indicator, it seems, of how the candidates will \"impact families, children, and national\" morality.</span></p> <p><span>In the back of Biblical Scoreboard is an advertisement for Conservative Digest, boasting flattering cover articles on South African President P.W. Botha, America's ever-in-hot-water Attorney General Ed Meese, plus Rev. Pat Robertson and Rev. Jerry Falwell.</span></p> <p><span>Another ad boasts \"Dark Secrets of the New Age\", an \"urgent message for Christians, warning them of Satan's plan for a One-World Religion.\" Another book \"reveals the demonic forces\" behind Satanism in the United States.</span></p> <p><span>This publication might seem laughable if it were not so influential. It will be distributed to thousands of churches in the coming months and sent to pastors whose flocks number in the millions. And it will motivate many to vote against candidates who endorse \"humanistic anti-God values\" (i.e., the Democrats) and for \"candidates who support Judeo-Christian values\" (i.e., the Republicans).</span></p> <p><span>The not so subtle message: by backing George Herbert Walker Bush, that Bible-believing, God-fearing Episcopalian, \"you'll be doing your Christian duty in helping to rebuild our nation and its institutions on the God-given foundation of Biblical truths.\"</span></p>"}

But none of this disguises the fact that Dukakis' image is <b>BORING,</b> that he is thought to be the ultimate technocrat, or that his speaking style is often wooden.</span></p> <p><span>The voters would be ashamed to cast their ballot for someone running on a platform of competence. That's not what presidential elections are about--they're about what Bush once called \"that vision thing.\" Vision as in \"it's morning in America,\" as in the New Frontier, the New Deal, the Great Society.</span></p> <p><span>The nuts and bolts of governing aren't of interest to the electorate. Most of them don't know who the contras are, and even fewer care whether Congress votes to support them. Statistics show that most often the candidate who presents the most optimistic speech at his party's convention wins in November. The lesson is clear if disheartening: Smile a lot and hire good speechwriters.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis could take his cue from the Massachusetts state advertising campaign, and attempt to convince the voters that he can \"make the spirit of Massachusetts fit the spirit of America.\" Bush could remind the electorate that he is the living heir to the Reagan Revolution, and that the Republican reign will live on.</span></p> <p><span>But never, ever should either candidate get so foolish as to start talking about raising taxes or the complexities of Middle East peace negotiations. He might get caught in the Walter Mondale trap of substance over style.</span></p> <p><span>Then again, neither Bush nor Dukakis has been too caught up in substantive campaigning. They have both played the game of political generalities and vague pronouncements that form the large part of campaigns today. Dukakis insists on the need for jobs and public-private partnerships, but refuses to provide any numbers to back up his ideas. And Bush, too, falls into the trap of talking without number signs--it makes it that much easier to support everything without promising much.</span></p> <p><span>But if they aren't going to concentrate on substance, the two candidates could at least try to master the basics of style.</span></p> <p><span>The early bird in presidential campaigns catches the worm. So Dukakis and Bush should remember: All's fair in love and war and to the victor goes the spoils.</span></p>"}

Jesse Jackson has nitched a spot for himself in history. <i>New Republic</i> writer Hendrik Hertzberg has claimed that Jackson is one of the most important Black leaders in America this century, ranking him behind only Booker T. Washington and Martin Luther King, Jr.</span></p> <p><span>Caught up in the thrill of seeing the first Black politician to enjoy national success, Blacks are losing perspective on just what Jackson's success means.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of asking politicians what Blacks should expect from them in the next administration and asking them about their civil rights records, they have become almost hypnotized with the Jesse Jackson question: How is Jesse being treated? Is he being included? What is Jesse's role?</span></p> <p><span>These are limited questions during an election race. Have Blacks really compared Gov. Michael S. Dukakis to Vice President George Bush? Remember, those are the two candidates. Or are they looking for a signal from Jesse Jackson as to whom he feels is the best candidate?</span></p> <p><span>So far, sadly, it appears to be the latter. Blacks have lined themselves up behind Jackson, who is now seen as the <i>the</i> Black leader.</span></p> <p><span><b>J</b>ACKSON is acknowledged by many to be the leader of Blacks. Exhibit A is not the 1988 Democratic Convention, which was dominated by Jackson, but the 1984 convention held in San Francisco.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson's followers heckled Coretta Scott King, widow of Martin Luther King Jr., and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young for not supporting Jackson.</span></p> <p><span>That shameful act merely proved to foreshadow the stranglehold Jackson has on Blacks. There is not a Black politician willing to outright challenge Jackson these days. King's former aides have also fallen into line. Jackson has proven that not only can he get the Black vote, but that he can also direct it.</span></p> <p><span>But there could be danger in this power. Jackson is now unchallenged. With Jackson holding all of the Black vote in his hands, he is actually paralyzing it at the same time.</span></p> <p><span>Look at what has happened to the Black vote this year. It has been the subject of the Dukakis-Jackson cat-and-mouse game.</span></p> <p><span>Jesse has it, Mike wants it.</span></p> <p><span>When it turned out that Jackson would not be on the ticket, and that he could further his own interests by conceding, he then gave the signal to Blacks that it's okay to vote for the other guy.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>CCORDING to the polls, the signal was detected. A poll conducted shortly afer the convention revealed that 81 percent of Blacks said they will support Dukakis in November.</span></p> <p><span>That same poll can be seen as discouraging to soon-to-be Republican nominee George Bush and a big victory for Dukakis and Jackson. With the Black vote in the bag, the Democratic Party has a legitimate shot at knocking off the Republicans for only the second time in the last six elections.</span></p> <p><span>But what does this say about the Black voter? Instead of comparing Dukakis and Bush to each other, Blacks have been blind followers of Jesse Jackson. While many of Jackson's delegates did not agree with his anti-nuclear no-first strike proposal to the Democratic Platform, they still supported it because it was Jackson's idea. Are these people supporting Jackson or his issues?</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>ITH a lock like that, one must wonder just how hard politicians will campaign for the Black vote in the future. This year, none of the candidates made concerted efforts to garner Black votes, as they all conceded the vote to Jackson early on. And Black voters did not get much attention until Dukakis emerged as the front-runner. Even then, Dukakis by-passed Blacks and went straight to Jesse Jackson.</span></p> <p><span>This time around, politicians did not waste their time bidding for Black voters. They focused on the bi-partisan Hispanic vote instead. Black voters stand up and tell Dukakis and Bush that they have minds of their own. What Blacks must say to Dukakis is \"show us.\" Jackson has given his \"recommendation,\" now is the time for Dukakis to show why Blacks should support him.</span></p> <p><span>Otherwise, there could come a day in which the Black vote will no longer be considered worthy of campaign stops.</span></p> <p><span>That is, until there is another legitimate Black candidate to challenge Jackson. When this happens, look for Jackson supporters to accuse the newcomer of being a stoolie, or an Uncle Tom for white Democrats who want to dislodge Jackson.</span></p> <p><span>Another dilemma would occur if the first Black to challenge Jackson is a Republican. This would immediatly split the vote. General Colin Powell and former Massachusetts Senator Ed Brooke have both surfaced as possible running mates for Vice-President George Bush.</span></p> <p><span>When another Black does emerge as a Presidential player, Black people will get the chance to see just whose interests Jesse Jackson has at heart.</span></p> <p><span>Either Jackson will attempt to silence the challenger as he tried earlier this year when Detroit Mayor Coleman Young refused to endorse him in Michigan. Or he will welcome the challenger, without trying to intimidate his competitor, and be glad there is another Black playing the game.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever happens, Black people have got to realize they don't need a leader. Leaders are happy to be leaders because they are in comfortable positions. Whenever anything concerning Blacks comes up, Jesse Jackson will be the one to answer.</span></p> <p><span>Not all Blacks agree with Jackson. Yet, because Jackson is the Black leader, and so long as Blacks are content to be his followers, his opinion will be the only one that counts.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Sticking A Thorn (burgh) in the Democrats' Side | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b> few weeks ago, I jokingly suggested in a column that Vice President George Bush select Edwin Meese III as his running mate for the Republican presidential ticket. By picking the attorney general, I wrote, Bush would put the sleaze factor squarely in his column and lock up the general election.</span></p> <p><span>That column was meant to be humorous, but the idea of Bush picking an attorney general as his running mate is still a good one. It's just that the man for the job isn't Meese, it's Richard L. Thornburgh.</span></p> <p><span>The director of the Kennedy School's Institute of Politics (IOP) and the former governor of Pennsylvania was nominated last month to replace the departing Meese as the head of the Justice Department. He <i>had</i> been mentioned as a possible running mate before his nomination, but since then his name has been largely ignored when political observers discuss the GOP ticket.</span></p> <p><span>Although Thornburgh will be very busy getting confirmed as attorney general by the Senate and cleaning up the mess left in the Justice Department by Meese, this should not exclude him from consideration for vice president. The IOP director offers the Republican Party a great opportunity to highlight its differences with Gov. Michael S. Dukakis as well as get some free publicity at the expense of Democratic Party.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE Senate confirmation hearings on Thornburgh begin today and will give him a great chance to make headlines and garner praise from Republicans and Democrats alike. Already, Thornburgh has been praised by many Democratic leaders as a qualified public servant with a great reputation for personal integrity. He is expected to pass through the Senate hearings with as little trouble as a hot knife has passing through butter.</span></p> <p><span>Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54 (D-Ma.), who will chair the hearings today because of an illness to Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.), said at the time of the nomination's announcement that he had the \"greatest respect\" for Thornburgh, adding that \"the state of justice in America would be very different today if Dick Thornburgh had been attorney general for the past three and a half years instead of Ed Meese.\"</span></p> <p><span>If Thornburgh were named as the vice presidential running mate after the hearings, there is no way that Kennedy, or any of the other Democrats who will praise Thornburgh during the appointment hearings, could criticize him as incompetent or lacking integrity.</span></p> <p><span>Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) also praised Thornburgh at the time of his appointment, calling him a \"man of competence.\" Competence is the main theme of the Democratic presidential candidate's campaign. Completing the Republican ticket with a \"man of competence,\" would easily deflate the Democratic balloon.</span></p> <p><span>The effect of Bush selecting Thornburgh as his running mate, would be to nullify one of the main criticisms weighing down his campaign--the Reagan Republican sleaze factor. Today, Thornburgh will be widely praised as a man of great personal integrity by the Senate leaders, many of whom will also take the opportunity to criticize the indiscretions of Meese. In choosing Thornburgh--the antithesis of Meese--Bush can project an image of a cleaner and more honest administration.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HORNBURGH will also be praised today for being a moderate rather than an ideologue. He is a Republican in the tradition of Rockefeller and Howard Baker, two men coming from the more widely respected wing of the party. To many moderates, including moderate Democrats who voted for Reagan in 1980 and '84, the choice will appear to indicate that a Bush administration will be more in the mainstream than the Reagan administration has been.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, the loudest opposition to Thornburgh may come from some of those furthest to the right. Sen. Gordon Humphrey (R-N.H.), a staunch supporter of the pro-life movement, raised a number of questions about Thornburgh's stance on the issue of abortion.</span></p> <p><span>But while a less unforgiving position on this issue may attract moderate Democrats, even this will not split the Republicans. Even if Thornburgh's and Bush's records of support for the pro-life movement are not as strong as the records of Orrin Hatch and Henry Hyde, they are far closer to the right than the records of Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd M. Bentsen (D-Tex.) The real pro-lifers, the great majority of whom vote, will surely not turn to the Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>Geographically, the selection of Thornburgh creates a problem for the Republicans, but not a great one. It may even prove strategic. By selecting a Northeasterner, Bush can go whole hog in pretending to be a Texan which he will need to do to beat Bentsen in the Longhorn State. And with Thornburgh on the ticket, such a move won't mean sacrificing support in the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states.</span></p> <p><span>Thornburgh also can guarantee the Republicans a state with a large number of electoral votes. Pennsylvania and it's 25 votes, which went for Reagan in 1980 and '84, has to go for the Republicans in 1988 for Bush to win.</span></p> <p><span>Thornburgh served for the maximum two consecutive terms in the state from 1979 to 1987 and earned high performance ratings from just about everyone. When he left office, he still had a public approval rating of 72 percent.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE similarities between Bush and Thornburgh will also help the Republicans play up the ideological differences between Bentsen and Dukakis on the Democratic ticket. Bush has spent much of his time criticizing Dukakis as weak on crime. Thornburgh's record as a hard-nosed crime buster when he was governor of Pennsylvania and as the head of the criminal division of the Justice Department will help to show the Democrats as weak on crime.</span></p> <p><span>Bush needs to overcome the so-called convention bump that has propelled Dukakis to big leads in opinion polls following the Democrat's party in Atlanta. The Bay State Governor's lead will shrink over the next few weeks, especially after Bush has a convention of his own in to put him in the spotlight.</span></p> <p><span>What Bush needs to do to bounce back himself is select a running mate who possesses the best characteristics of the Republican party with few of its drawbacks. Thornburgh fits the description.</span></p>"}

Oregon hasn't voted for a Democrat since Lyndon Johnson beat Barry Goldwater in 1964.</span></p> <p><span>It isn't that Oregon has been moved by that Dukakis charisma. Mike's moving oratory hasn't wow-ed the Oregonians. His allusions to ethnicity and the \"Massachusetts Miracle\" haven't electrified the folks at home. People are for Dukakis because they're sick and tired of George Bush.</span></p> <p><span>Call him a fighter pilot, call him the President's right hand man--but to millions of Americans, George Herbert Walker Bush is still a wimp. The wimpfactor wasn't invented by the Democrats or by caustic cartoonists. As early as 1980, Manchester Union Leader Publisher William Loeb insisted that the Yale-bred Bush is \"an incompetent wimp.\"</span></p> <p><span>Trying to shed this wimp image, the Vice President has insulted women, shouted at journalists, and intimidated children. This is the man who got beat by Geraldine Ferraro in a 1984 debate--then bragged to his rich Republican buddies that he had \"kicked a little ass.\"</span></p> <p><span>This is the Vice President who ambushed a television anchorman live on the evening news, then bragged about it for weeks. That same month, Mr. Tough Guy struck again. Bush was speaking at an Iowa high school when he fielded a hostile question from a girl holding a \"Jack Kemp for President\" brochure. Bush seized the pamphlet and tore it to shreds.</span></p> <p><span>The night he lost a straw poll in Ames County, Iowa, Bush insisted that a lot of his supporters had been busy attending social events and \"debutante balls.\" After the debutantes had helped him win 19 percent of the turnout, Bush easily outpaced Al Haig, Pierre duPont, and Jack Kemp.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>FTER his Iowa showing, Bush called together some Republican media big-wigs to plot strategy. These media big boys determined that Dole had won Iowa because he had a good slogan. \"Bob Dole--One of Us,\" it said. Knowing a good political slogan when he sees one, Bush snapped it up. All over New England \"George Bush--One of Us\" signs sprouted up. Bush won the New Hampshire primary, and coasted into Super Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span>George Bush called on his opponents to abide by the GOP's eleventh commandment: \"Thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow Republican.\" When polls showed the VP behind Dole, however, he abandoned the commandment and came out swinging. Bob Dole was, George Bush insisted, a \"sunshine patriot.\" Dole spent two years in a military hospital recuperating from wounds received in World War II.</span></p> <p><span>George Bush has more home states than Steve's has ice cream flavors. He can't make up his mind whether he's really a son of Massachusetts (where he was born), or Texas (where he's registered to vote) or Maine (where he owns a home), Connecticut (where he attended Yale) or Washington, D.C.--where he resides when he's not attending funerals. Voters who heckled about Gary Hartpence's name-change will also be turned off by Bush's favorite-son strategy.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>N the campaign trail, Bush likes to allude to the successes of the \"Reagan-Bush\" administration. But the public will be reviewing the Reagan-Bush failures as well. George Bush can promise to be the \"education president.\" But the voters won't forget that Reagan-Bush attempted to slash education spending. He can talk about compassion, but most voters will remember who was slashing food stamp programs during the 1981 - 1983 recession. The Vice President can promise to bring integrity back to Washington, but he can't hide the fact that he stood behind Meese, Deaver, Nofziger, McFarlane, North, and Reagan's other crooked croneys.</span></p> <p><span>Ronald Reagan remains a very popular president, seven years into his term. He is popular not because of his intellectual prowess or his command of details. People like Reagan's personality and they believe he's a strong leader. Bush's personality pales next to Reagan, and he fails to convince voters that he would provide forceful leadership if elected.</span></p> <p><span>By billing himself as Reagan's right-hand man, Bush managed to capture the Republican nomination. Capturing the support of the American electorate will be a little harder.</span></p> <p><span>Between now and November, Mike Dukakis and George Bush will debate the economy, national defense, and their visions for America's future. But in the end, George Bush will lose the election because he's not \"one of us\" and he's not Ronald Reagan.</span></p> <p><span>Bush can count on the Deep South and on New Hampshire. But if Bush's message doesn't sell in traditionally Republican states--like Oregon--then Bush is in serious trouble.

{"title": "A Taxing Reality | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>F</b>ROM an oratorical standpoint, Walter Mondale gave the best speech of his life that night. The crowd at the 1984 Democratic convention in San Francisco (admittedly, a partisan audience) was hanging on his every word. Even though he was following Mario Cuomo, Jesse Jackson and Geraldine Ferraro, the lead-toungued Minnesotan was thrilling the audience.</span></p> <p><span>And then he made the worst political mistake of his life--he told the truth. Mondale told the convention and the nation, \"Mr. Reagan will raise taxes. So will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\" His resounding defeat in November, largely attributable to that pledge, reaffirmed the sad fact that honesty with the American electorate is political suicide.</span></p> <p><span>Bruce Babbitt made the same mistake in this year by candidly telling voters that he would impose a few carefully planned tax increases. Although pundits gave him kudos for his candor, the voters cudgelled him at the polls.</span></p> <p><span>The American electorate has a remarkable tendency to hear only what it wants to. And when the unwanted message comes, America's swiftness in dispatching the messenger is unmatched.</span></p> <p><span>The other candidates have learned this lesson well. George Bush unequivocally rules out a tax increase, saying that he will cure our budgetary ills with spending cuts. Mike Dukakis plans to raise revenue with a tax amnesty program and tougher enforcement. Pat Robertson has even suggested holding a \"jubilee\" every fifty years when all debts would be forgiven.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N all likelihood, every candidate secretly realizes that the 41st President will somehow have to find additional revenue. But they still disguise their intentions behind pledges to raise taxes \"only as a last resort.\" Next to Babbitt, Paul Simon came closest to the truth when he revealed that this \"last resort\" effort would probably come during his first year in office.</span></p> <p><span>Even when the candidates publicly consider tax increases, they never call them that. Instead, tax increases become \"revenue enhancers.\" Can \"negative refunds\" be far behind? Confronted with the paradox that playing it straight with the voters equals electoral disaster, Presidential aspirants have understandably chosen to hide behind euphemism and obfuscation.</span></p> <p><span>Babbitt's \"stand-up campaign\" dramatized the fact that while none of us want reduced services or higher taxes, neither do we want high deficits bequeathed to our children. Our desire for a gain-no pain cure has left us looking like a whiny child, unwilling to swallow the bitter, restorative fiscal medicine. We have entrusted the economic health of the nation to Dr. Feelgood and have demonstrated a willingness to forgive deception and punish forthrightness.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HERE is a Chinese story by Lu Hsun about a philosopher who is telling a parable to his acolyte. Three men are admiring their neighbor's newborn son. The first man complimented the boy, saying \"One day, this boy will be rich.\" The second said, \"One day, this boy will be a high official.\" The third, a bit more realistic, said \"One day, this boy will die,\" whereupon the others beat him senseless.</span></p> <p><span>The acolyte immediately recognized the dilemma. \"I don't want to lie,\" he said, \"but neither do I want to be beaten. What should I do?\" The wise old philosopher, who is now no doubt a Presidential campaign consultant, replied, \"Then you must only laugh and say, 'This boy! Ha Ha Ha! Look at this boy!'\"</span></p> <p><span>The nation has unwittingly conditioned its Presidential candidates to do the same--make only meaningless noises about the deficit. The perverse, tacit agreement between the electorate and the candidates is, \"Don't upset us, even if you have to fib a bit, and we'll vote for you.\"</span></p> <p><span>Part of the blame for this sad irony lies with President Reagan, whose administration has been a case study in the political value of shameless dissembling. His success certainly has inspired Bush, and probably the Democratic candidates as well. But the real guilt rests with us, the voters. We wanted our President to be a collective father figure, an infallible, paternal presence. We wanted to believe Daddy's promises, and to hell with those doomsayers who would disturb our comfortable fantasy.</span></p> <p><span>Eventually, the absurdity of \"no tax\" pledges, like the Emperor's nudity, will be recognized. Unfortunately, we have thus far ostracized the naively honest candidates who tried to force the realization upon us.

{"title": "Jimmy the Duke | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>S Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis another Jimmy Carter? Dukakis doesn't want voters to think so--but by running in the Carter mold, he may actually vanquish an opponent who can't separate himself from President Reagan.</span></p> <p><span>Political pundits like to compare the two governors as two technocrats, who are concerned with getting the job done. Both run not as saviors, but as competent managers. And both have built a reputation for integrity and hard work.</span></p> <p><span>But Dukakis cringes from the Carter comparisons, recalling negative polls and hostages more than policy achievements. Bush is also attuned to past polls--after all, his model, Reagan, was one of the most popular presidents. But Dukakis would be wise to avoid a game he cannot and should not want to win. Rhetoric and dubious records are what he should be running against; a substantive record like Carter's is what he should be proposing.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of composing a foreign policy based primarily on rhetoric, Carter made more tangible gains in four years than Reagan has in eight. He orchestrated the Camp David accords, normalized relations with China, and pushed the Panama Canal treaty through Congress.</span></p> <p><span>These accomplishments, like the Marshall Plan and the Cuban Missile Crisis, represent some of the few postwar foreign policy successes of the United States. Despite the continued regional difficulties, a rejection of the canal treaty, which Reagan backed, would have inflamed Latin American nationalism and anti-American sentiment even more. And General Omar Torrijos, the head of the Panamanian government, said he would have destroyed the canal if the treaty were rejected--which would have eliminated a vital strategic and economic asset. Despite the continued strife in the Middle East, at least on one front, Israel has much less to worry about. Outside of the INF treaty, what like acheivements will Reagan be remembered for?</span></p> <p><span>Critics say Carter's emphasis on human rights, which targeted oppressive regimes, paved the way for the Soviet Union to pursue its expansionary policy in the Third World. As a result, they claim, America was humiliated, as seen in the hostage crisis in Iran.</span></p> <p><span>But as weak as he may have appeared, Carter never stooped to trading arms for hostages. And he hardly ignored the abuses of our adversaries. He was quick to denounce violations of human rights in Soviet-bloc countries. Under his administration, the flow of Jewish emigration from Russia reached its highest level. He also campaigned for human rights in right-wing regimes: his Administration's diplomatic pressure spurred the release of thousands of victims of state repression in Brazil and Indonesia. Carter \"stood tall\" to all opponents of human rights, on the Left and Right, unlike the Reagan administration.</span></p> <p><span>While Carter was criticized for the hostage crisis in Iran, he did manage to get the hostages released--an achievement Reagan has yet to accomplish in Lebanon, with far fewer lives at stake.</span></p> <p><span>Republicans may whine about the \"gloom and doom\" and the rampant inflation of the Carter years. Soaring inflation and interest rates during the Carter years had less to do with national policies than with an unfavorable world financial scene caused by the energy crisis. And the drop in oil prices during the Reagan years, likewise, should not be credited to the Administration.</span></p> <p><span>The Reagan Administration has failed to reach much of the country with its economic gains, but its irresponsible fiscal policy managed to mortgage the entire country's economic strength and future. Reaganomics is not even a shining success by supply-side standards--the president has all but ignored his campaign promises to balance the budget and slash government spending. The recent period of economic growth has been tempered by the deepest recession since the Great Depression, the panic on Wall Street, the rise of the \"twin towers\" (the budget and trade deficits) and a trillion dollar jump in the national debt.</span></p> <p><span>Even the 1986 tax reform act, which Jack Kemp fans call the culmination of Reagan's campaign to \"get government off our backs,\" was an about-face from Reagan's initial tax agenda. His 1981 tax bill expanded loopholes and shelters for corporations and the rich at the expense of the poor and boosted the budget deficit. He still opposed the latest tax reforms until it became politically impossible to do so.</span></p> <p><span>As for ethics in government, Dukakis would be wise to follow Carter's lead. Carter's one ethical liability, Bert Lance, was never convicted of any crime. This administration certainly outdid his record with its influence-peddling officials, ideologues-gone-astray, and just plain crooks--from Michael Deaver, Lyn Nofziger, and Edwin Meese to Oliver North, John Poindexter, and William Casey to Anne Gorsuch, Rita Lavelle, and Raymond Donovan. Carter got Lance to resign, even after he was found innocent, while Reagan ignored rampant corruption.</span></p> <p><span>Despite his faults, Carter was clearly in charge and on top of all policy decisions. He came forth when he erred, rather than trying to shift the blame to Congress or to his subordinates. No one can say the same of Reagan. If Dukakis wants to be known as a president possessing hands-on, competent management skills, instead of one proclaiming empty miracles, Carter is America's most recent example.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Laissez-Faire Racism | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>E</b>VERYONE knows that racial intolerance has been building during the Reagan years. We can all feel it--and we can point to Forsyth Country, to Bernard Goetz, and to Howard Beach as evidence. But where are the causes of this creeping racism? Who or what is to blame for derailing the consistent progress this country made towards greater civil rights in the last 30 years.</span></p> <p><span>The Reagan Administration has made a surprisingly poor target. President Reagan has not been playing George Wallace, hurling racist slurs, and chanting \"segregation forever.\" While David Stockman's book reveals some racist attitudes at the White House, and the press worried for a while that Reagan was going to \"turn back the clock\" on civil rights, the Reagan Administration has taken a pretty low-key posture on civil rights.</span></p> <p><span>And this is exactly the problem. The Reagan Administration has not waged a loud war on civil rights. Instead it has adopted a sort of laissez-faire attitude towards racism, and allowed civil rights to fade into the background of national debate. Meanwhile it has quietly appointed scores of conservative judges to the Federal Courts and to the Supreme Court. Only now, after seven years of relative quiet on the civil rights front, are these appointments taking their toll--giving America a bitter taste of the Reagan legacy.</span></p> <p><span>On April 25, Reagan's three Supreme Court appointees--Justices Kennedy, O'Connor, and Scalia--joined Justices Rehnquist and White and voted to reconsider the right of minorities to sue private parties for racial discrimination under a post-Civil War statute, section 1981 of Title 42 of the United States Code. If the Court overturns section 1981, as it is expected to do, it will be the first time in 100 years that the Court has overturned a precedent expanding minority rights.</span></p> <p><span>At issue is the 1976 decision by the Court in Runyon v. McCrary which affirmed that section 1981 was intended to bar racial discrimination by private schools, employers, and other parties in deciding whom they will accept, hire, contract with, and do business. The statute states that all people have the same right \"to make and enforce contracts\" as \"is enjoyed by white citizens.\"</span></p> <p><span>If the decision is overturned, no Federal law would bar racial discrimination by private schools. Victims of racial discrimination by private employers would have less legal protection and weaker remedies.</span></p> <p><span>For although the Civil Rights Act of 1964 generally bars large employers from discriminating on grounds of race, sex, religion, or national origin, it does not cover employers with fewer than 15 employees, has a short statute of limitations and allows victims of discrimination only reinstatement with back pay. Under the Runyon decision, section 1981 protection was interpreted to apply to all private employers, regardless of size. And victims of discrimination have a right to punitive damages for outrageous violations.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>F the Supreme Court overturns the Runyon decision, victims of racial discrimination simply won't have the same recourse to law that they have enjoyed for the past 10 years. It's one thing for sporadic racist attacks to occur in a country where the government is devoted to the protection of minorities. It's another thing altogether for the Supreme Court, a governmental check meant to protect the rights of minorities, to be stripping away the rights of minorities to protect themselves against job discrimination. Here the Reagan Administration's true colors shine clear.</span></p> <p><span>Now we know why George Bush must be prevented from getting elected in November, but Presidential politics is not a sufficient answer. A Democratic President could insure that the Court's liberals are replaced by liberals, but he couldn't do anything about the comparatively young conservative majority on the Court. We may soon have to accept the fact that the Supreme Court will refuse to combat racism for a decade or more.</span></p> <p><span>People who are concerned about racism must combat the new tolerance for intolerance with a hard-nosed intolerance for racism in any form, and in any place.</span></p> <p><span>As Harvard students, we can start this battle at home. College students have historically been at the forefront of America's battles against racism. Black colleges in the South were centers of early civil rights activism--Jesse Jackson got his start at North Carolina A&amp;T. During the 1960s, students pointed out that universities represent the values of our culture. By changing the university, we can begin to change the rest of the world. This lesson rings true today, when we needn't look farther than the white face of virtually every single faculty member at this College to see racism in action--and inaction.</span></p> <p><span>The recent report on Minority Faculty Recruitment by the Harvard Minority Students Alliance demonstrated the Faculty of Arts and Sciences' dismal lack of any effort to recruit more minority faculty. The departments of Arts, Chemistry, and Biology--only 16 History, and Biology made 11 job searches and received 721 applications in 1986-87. Only four of these applications were from minorities, indicating that these departments make almost no effort to recruit minority applications, let alone to hire minorities.</span></p> <p><span>The minority faculty statistics for 1986-87 speak for themselves. Out of 434 positions in 10 departments--Economics, Government, Psychology, Sociology, English, History, VES, Fine Arts, Chemistry, and Biology--only 16 are filled by minority faculty. Eight of these are foreign scholars.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>TUDENT and faculty protests for better minority recruitment have spread like wildfire at campuses across the country this spring. Duke University students and faculty were able to change minority recruitment policy to require that each of the university's more than 50 departments hire at least one additional black faculty member by 1993. If the departments fail, they must show why they failed and undergo an outside review of their recruiting procedures.</span></p> <p><span>Williams College students took over the office of the Dean of the College on April 22 to demand increased minority hiring. A group of minority students at the University of Vermont won an accord with the administration that calls for adding four to 11 new minority faculty members a year for the next four years and for doubling the number of minority students within that time. Students at Penn State took over a campus building and demanded that the university comply with a court injunction to increase the number of Black students to 5 percent, but they were refuted.</span></p> <p><span>This little-noticed surge of student activism for minority recruitment is the most encouraging new blow in the fight against racism. Harvard students should take the cue and follow up on the report on Minority Recruitment with some action on minority recruitment.</span></p> <p><span>If the universities don't fight the tolerance for racial intolerance that has built up in Reagan's America, who will? At a time that the Supreme Court is already revoking the rights of minorities, we can't afford to acquiesce any further to the complacency of the Reagan years.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Trading In Opportunities | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>T'S dead in the water. For all of its merits and none of its flaws, the trade bill of 1988 will not make it past President Reagan's desk.</span></p> <p><span>After months of balancing every member's special interest, the House and Senate succeeded last week in producing an omnibus trade bill designed to rein in the ballooning $170 billion trade deficit.</span></p> <p><span>Surprisingly, most of the 1000-page bill is agreeable to Congressmen on both sides of the aisle. Republicans like it because the most blatant protectionist measures--such as the Gephardt amendment--have been diluted or jettisoned. Democrats like it because it offers relief for beleaguered industries.</span></p> <p><span>In essence, the trade bill rejects both unrestricted free trade and short-sighted protectionism, embracing \"fair-trade.\" The bill authorizes the President to retaliate against trading partners that persistently engage in unfair practices.</span></p> <p><span>But in spite of the bill's merits, President Reagan has vowed not to sign it. Sure there are some dubious provisions, such as the many pet projects of Congressmen more interested in their constituents than in an effective trade policy. Rep Beryl Anthony (D.-Ark.) inserted a provision lowering tariffs on watch parts, a move that would benefit the Timex plant in his district. Rep. Don Bonker (D.-Wash.) wants to restrict plywood imports that hurt his state's timber industry.</span></p> <p><span>But Reagan is willing to overlook these petty indulgences. His opposition to the trade bill hinges on only one provision: a requirement that companies warn employees 60 days before closing a plant.</span></p> <p><span>Forget the Reagan nonsense that requiring notification of plant closings would unnecessarily handicap American industry and endanger jobs. The provision would merely require that companies notify workers before laying off more than 500 of them, or one-third of their employees. Both West Germany and Japan have even stricter laws, and their competitiveness has not suffered.</span></p> <p><span>The plant closing measure merely places human lives above corporate profit. Never again would multi-billion dollar corporations be allowed to wreck hundreds of families at a stroke without at least giving them a few weeks to rearrange their lives.</span></p> <p><span>Admittedly, this doesn't happen often, and many companies already voluntarily provide such notices. But the plant closing provision would ensure that faceless corporations don't leave families without a chance to salvage their future.</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, the President told reporters that the notification requirement would be \"very restrictive on business and industry in America...if that item is in there, I can't sign it.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>ITH that promise, the death knell sounded for the trade bill. The Democratic leadership was unable to win the necessary two-thirds majority in the Senate to override the forthcoming Presidential veto. But whether or not another trade bill is passed, the veto could turn out to be a hidden blessing for the Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>Few issues have such visceral appeal to workers as the plant-closing provision. Mike Dukakis, with his promotion of high-tech growth and labor management cooperation, has had some trouble convincing blue-collar voters that he can represent their interests. His declaration of support for the plant closing measure should go far in reasserting the Democrats' former hold on the blue-collar vote. Dukakis' support of the plant closing measure would serve notice that he represents the party of compassion, and Bush the party of privilege.</span></p> <p><span>Once again, the Democrats have placed themselves firmly on the proper side of a polarizing debate, and they should relentlessly pursue the issue into the election.</span></p> <p><span>During their recent efforts to stampede state legislatures into enacting anti-takeover laws, businesses like USX (formerly US Steel) have piously invoked their \"attachments\" and \"responsibilities\" to communities in which they are located. After years of shamelessly packing up their businesses and moving whenever profits dictated, these businesses are attempting to portray themselves as benefactors, interested only in the good of the community.</span></p> <p><span>In response to this hypocrisy, Robert Reich, Lecturer in Public Policy at the Kennedy School, satirically proposed the \"Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is Amendment\" to such anti-takeover legislation. Under his proposal, businesses taking advantage of takeover protection would be obligated to live up to their professed responsibilities to the community by, among other things, providing 60-day notice for plant closings.</span></p> <p><span>While his amendment is fanciful, his reasoning is not. USX complains about corporate raiders \"serving only their self-interest at the expense of...the community.\" One might ask, then, what exactly motivated USX--if not self-interest at the expense of the community--to ruin hundreds of families in Gary, West Virginia, by suddenly laying off every single worker.</span></p> <p><span>The point is, convenient \"deep attachments\" aside, corporations cannot be relied on to uphold their responsibility to communities that sustain them. The 60-day notification measure simply ensures that they will.</span></p> <p><span>It will not seriously endanger fat corporate profits, but it will save families from financial disaster. Reagan cost the Republican party a wonderful opportunity to salvage its image with workers. The Democrats should play it for all it's worth.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Preaching Donkeys | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>\"M</b>OST Americans would be surprised to learn that God is a Republican,\" a bitter Walter Mondale said in 1984 after Jerry Falwell and a host of other conservative religious figures called for the re-election of Ronald Reagan.</span></p> <p><span>For eight years, Reagan has been the darling of the religious right. The 25 million member voting bloc helped him gain a majority in 1980. In his reelection more than 70 percent of white evangelical voters backed the president.</span></p> <p><span>This election, however, there is every reason to think this voting bloc is up for grabs. Evangelical territory isn't necessarily a Republican bastion--born-again Jimmy Carter carried it handily in 1976 (despite his interview with Playboy Magazine and his pro-choice, pro-ERA platform). And Michael Dukakis should carry it, too--especially if he intends to make headway in the South.</span></p> <p><span>Skeptics will wonder whether a liberal Northeasterner can make inroads with the evangelical community. They should remember that Reagan, a divorced actor who seldom attends church, took in more evangelical support than a Southern Baptist sunday school teacher. (The Southern Baptist Convention, with nearly 15 million members, is the largest evangelical group.) The main reason: Carter ignored evangelicals while Reagan actively pursued their support.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE Republicans won over the bloc by default, not a divine mandate on the issues. Evangelical voters support adding funding to the poor as well as cutting funding to abortion clinics. They are not natural allies of the Contras and the Defense department; they would be more likely to back peace in Central America and the Middle East.</span></p> <p><span>The Democratic strategists have mistakenly dismissed the group as a single-issue--anti-abortion--constituency. Instead they should be appealing to evangelicals on the issues they have in common, such as aid to children, the elderly and the poor. Winning over the bloc is much more a question of how a candidate frames the debate, than his stance on every issue; righteous positions can be taken on many fronts, even without crossing the barrier between church and state.</span></p> <p><span>And the Republicans have made it even easier for the Democrats to attract evangelicals in this election. Dukakis can capitalize on the sleaze factor. Evangelicals would welcome a President promising to bring ethics back to Washington. \"St. Dukakis,\" as his wife so fondly calls him, seems a lot cleaner than the Republican candidate, who is rumored to have had a long-term affair and has dealt with drug-dealing dictators.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>LTHOUGH abortion will be a key stumbling block to courting the religious vote, it need not be insurmountable. Evangelicals have distrusted George Bush's sincerity on the issue, since he shifted rightward to curry their support in 1980. And Reagan has done little to overturn Roe v. Wade. Even considering the Republican's pro-life platform, as one politician said, the party's concern for human life begins at conception and ends at birth; yet, evengelicals purportedly want to save and help people throughout their lives.</span></p> <p><span>The Democratic platform would appeal to many who attend conservative Christian churches each week. The Democrats have protected programs for the elderly, kept Reagan's hands off the school lunch programs, and they've protested when the Republican have gone after food stamps and other programs which benefit the poor, the elderly, and the sick.</span></p> <p><span>Although the evangelical leadership pledged their support to a president as telegenic as they were in the last two elections, this time around endorsements from the discredited, scandalized preachers will hold much less weight. Rank-and-file believers are still the type of people that the Democratic party has traditionally attracted--poor Southerners.</span></p> <p><span>The Democratic party is known for its ability to pull together diverse groups. Jesse Jackson's success is proof that party can garner much support from a populist platform and a charismatic pitch to the disenfranchised. The Democrats should find this method to be equally effective in attracting evangelicals.</span></p>"}

Dukakis's workfare policies in <i>The Boston Globe,</i> the presidential candidate was given a chance to respond at a national press conference. He said that he did not know who Wilson was.</span></p> <p><span>He should find out in hurry.</span></p> <p><span>From the cover of <i>Time</i> to Bill Moyers's reports on CBS, the problems of inner-city ghettos have moved to the forefront of public attention in the last decade. The rates of crime, out-of-wedlock births, female-headed house-holds and joblessness in the inner cities rose drastically throughout the 1970s and 1980s, to the growing concern of politicians and public policy makers.</span></p> <p><span>Discussions of the underclass in the 1970s and 1980s tended to frame the issues in individualistic terms, blaming the plight of the underclass on individual shortcomings, such as lack of motivation or bad attitudes toward work. This \"culture of poverty\" thesis achieved widespread acceptance in a country which has long believed that poverty begins at home, and became the cornerstone of the Black neoconservative critique of the welfare system. Theorists such as Kennedy School Professor Glenn Loury and Thomas Sowell denounced welfare for reinforcing the deviant behavior patterns of the inner-city poor, which is largely Black.</span></p> <p><span><i>The Truly Disdadvantaged</i> marks a significant departure from this approach because it treats lack of motivation or a bad work ethic as the consequence of basic changes in the community structure of inner-city ghettos. In place of a culture of poverty, Wilson posits social isolation--a distinction which shifts the problem from the psychological to the socio-economic realm. Instead of blaming poverty and its associated pathologies primarily on the individual, as conservatives do, or on the effects of contemporary racism, as some liberal scholars do, Wilson calls for a \"refocused liberal perspective\" which emphasizes \"the dynamic interplay between ghetto-specific cultural characteristics and social and economic opportunities.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the last 20 years, there have been drastic increases in the rates of violent crime among Blacks, the number of female-headed Black households under the poverty line, out-of-wedlock births and teenage pregnancy. Recent longitudinal studies have shown that 60 percent of all those in poverty are long-term poor who will be in poverty for spells of eight or more years; female-headed households are disproportionately represented.</span></p> <p><span>The statistics are repeated with a numbing frequency, but Wilson contends that because the underclass is overwhelmingly Black, such statistics tend to reinforce racial stereotypes, again focusing attention on individual characterisitcs instead of the deterioration of the ghetto community strucuture. His task is to break through that impediment and to show the structural basis for urban poverty.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>ILSON traces the deterioration of the inner city to basic economic changes which radically altered the occupational structure of the central cities. As big industry moved out of the cities in the 1970s, the job market in the inner city increasingly consisted of service-sector jobs which required higher levels of education. With fewer unskilled and semi-skilled jobs available, joblessness among young Black males rose sharply while labor-force participation rates declined steadily, to the point where joblessness \"has reached catastrophic proportions.\"</span></p> <p><span>As late as the 1960s, urban ghettos were communities unto themselves, featuring a vertical integration of the different segments of the Black urban population. Yet basic changes in the American economy have resulted in an exodus of the working- and middle- Blacks, Wilson argues. The ghettos of the 1980s are concentrated areas of extreme poverty isolated from mainstream social institutions.</span></p> <p><span>Because of these basic economic and demographic changes, poverty has been concentrated in the inner cities. In 1970, 16 of 77 Chicago neighborhoods were classified as poverty areas, with one of these an extreme-poverty area. By 1980, the number of poverty areas had increased to 26, the number of extreme-poverty areas to 9.</span></p> <p><span>The growth of high- and extreme-poverty areas \"epitomizes the social transformation of the inner city\" as the proportion of people suffering from long spells of joblessness in the inner city grows. This concentration has, Wilson argues, a significant impact on the individuals and families living in these areas.</span></p> <p><span>The high rates of joblessness among young Black males in the inner cities, Wilson claims, have a decisive impact on family structure and welfare dependency in the ghetto. Wilson has made a significant contribution to poverty research by creating a \"Male Marriageable Pool Index\" (MMPI). Inspired by discussions with inner-city women in Chicago, who said there simply were not that many men who could support a family, the MMPI measures the number of employed men per 100 women of the same age and race.</span></p> <p><span>Among Blacks, the MMPI has fallen severely in the last decades; it has remained steady or increased for white women since 1954. In the poor community of Oakland in Chicago, the MMPI for Blacks over 16 years of age was 70 in 1950; in 1980, there were only 19 employed Black men per 100 black women. This drastic decline in the MMPI is, Wilson argues, one of the main causes of the tendency to delay marriage and the low rate of marriage among Black women--which both contribute to the number of female-headed households and out-of-wedlock births.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE real impact of the concentration of poverty in the ghettos and the increasing social isolation of the underclass has been to create \"a social milieu significantly different from the environment that existed in these communities several decades ago.\" Increasingly, the members of the underclass live in a world radically different from mainstream society.</span></p> <p><span>But Wilson is making a fine, but important, correction to the culture of poverty thesis which also sees the ghettos as preserves of deviant behavior. For Wilson, the prevalence of single-parent households is not the result of a change in attitudes towards the traditional family, but rather the effect of economic forces which make it hard for men to support families. In his recent Godkin lecture at Harvard, Wilson noted that the latest survey research shows that the truly disadvantaged actually share mainstream attitudes towards work, family and crime.</span></p> <p><span>Social isolation aggravates the effects of highly concentrated poverty. With the absence of strong urban Black middle and working classes, individuals undergoing extended spells of poverty and joblessness can no longer look to the social institutions of their community (such as churches, schools, community groups etc.) for support or to succesful Blacks as role models. In such an environment, joblessness as a way of life tends to lose its stigma and the connection between education and good jobs disappears from sight.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE recognition of the impact of structural constraints and opportunities on the life chances of the underclass opens up a slew of public policy alternatives. Wilson states in his preface that a major goal of <i>The Truly Disadvantaged</i> is precisely to spell out some of these public policy alternatives.</span></p> <p><span>Wilson makes no bones about being a social democrat, and his policy suggestions are correspondingly nothing if not ambitious in the context of American politics. He is not afraid to claim that helping the underclass entails an overhaul of the American economy and growth in the public sector.</span></p> <p><span>Given that the underclass is over-whlemingly comprised of Blacks and Hispanics, it may at first seem suprising that Wilson opposes affirmative action. Wilson has two objections to racespecific policies. First, affirmative action programs in their different forms all tend to benefit the relatively well-off disproportianately. For inner-city Blacks without access to an appropriate job market, affirmative action is of little use. Secondly, race-specific policies are notoriously unpopular politically, especially in times when the economy suffers setbacks.</span></p> <p><span>Race-specific policies such as afirmative action or training programs are not to be abandoned, but are to be incorporated into a universal program of economic reform, designed to benefit all segments of society. Specifically, Wilson suggests a \"macroeconomic policy designed to promote both economic growth and a tight labor market\" combined with fiscal and monetary policies designed to curb inflation. A tight labor market would raise wages and aid the truly disadvantaged disproportionately, as increased labor force participation rates for both Black men and Black women would go far in stabilizing underclass family and community structure.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>S of now the truly disadvantaged are being made to play the role of Sisyphus, with public policy makers condemning them for failing to-reach the top. Until it is recognized that like in that ancient parabale, the failure lies beyond the control of the individual, a solution to the problems of the inner city will never be found.</span></p>"}

He said the latest polls show Dukakis with a slim but significant lead with 43 percent support to Jackson's 35 percent.</span></p> <p><span>The recent withdrawal of Rep. Richard Gephardt (D.-Mo.) has left a small pool of uncommitted support which both Jackson and Dukakis seem to be dividing evenly, the experts said.</span></p> <p><span>Following Jackson's stunning triumph in the Michigan caucuses, the Wisconsin primary has taken on large importance in the campaign. A Jackson victory could well propel him to the nomination, while a Dukakis triumph could stem what seems to be a growing Jackson groundswell.</span></p> <p><span>\"No one thought he was more than a blip on a screen until Michigan,\" said Boston political consultant Michael Goldman of Jackson. \"Now Democrats are getting seriously worried.\" Victory today would mean that Jackson may win the Democratic nomination but he would meet certain defeat in the general election, Goldman said.</span></p> <p><span>But since Wisconsin has a very small Black population, Jackson's main voting base, a strong showing would add credence to his claim that he is capable of drawing support from all voters.</span></p> <p><span>Burns said that Jackson and Duka- kis are campaigning in the same places and forthe same voters.</span></p> <p><span>Goldman said that the lack of competition onthe Republican side of tomorrow's primary maycomplicate things for the Democrats, andespecially for Dukakis.</span></p> <p><span>Some Republican voters are expected tocrossover and vote for Jackson under Wisconsin'sopen primary system in an attempt to undermine theDemocratic effort in November, Goldman said.

{"title": "It's Time to Take Jesse Seriously | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>E</b>VER since the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson's resounding victory in the Michigan caucuses, political pundits have been forecasting doom for the Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>On the one hand, were Jackson to be the Democratic party's nominee, conventional wisdom holds that he would be a sure loser in the general election. Even to George Bush.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, despite his remarkable success this year, poll after poll shows Jackson losing to Bush. Democrats also fear that a Jackson ticket would allow the Republicans to regain control of the Senate and make substantial gains in the House.</span></p> <p><span>On the other hand, any attempt at a \"stop Jackson\" movement, especially if it comes as a last-ditch effort at the convention, would backfire and profoundly alienate the Democratic party's most loyal constituency--the Blacks. Such an effort would weaken the eventual Democratic nominee by driving Black voters away from the polls.</span></p> <p><span>\"Either way it hurts,\" said one party elder last week, summing up the \"Jackson problem\" confronting the Democrats. \"Down one path we have to turn our backs on everything this party has purported to stand for--and on our most loyal voting bloc. Down the other, we face certain disaster in the fall.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT the Jackson rising may turn out to work for the Democratic Party instead of hobbling it. Finally Jackson will be accorded the respect he deserves as a potential nominee, and his views will no longer go unchallenged.</span></p> <p><span>For if Jackson is a legitimate, serious contender for--and possible winner of--his party's presidential nomination (which he certainly is), then he deserves the same respect accorded to all the other candidates. More importantly, his views, actions, and record should undergo the same intense scrutiny that his competitors do.</span></p> <p><span>So far, party leaders have treated him with condescension and kid gloves. The media have asked endlessly \"What does Jesse want?\" And the other Democratic candidates with the exception of Al Gore even to refuse to attack his viewpoints. All this wary treatment of the Jackson candidacy reflects a subtle form of racism saying that he must be handled with care, that he cannot win the nomination no matter how high his vote totals, and that his positions therefore are not worthy of being debated.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, as the current delegate count shows, Jackson has a very legitimate shot at winning the party's nomination. And it's about time that the media, Democratic party officials, and the other candidates start taking Jackson, his record, and his views seriously. As Rep. Thomas Downey (D.-N.Y.) pointed out, there's a racial double standard protecting Jackson, who has so far been given a \"free ride on some very controversial issues.\"</span></p> <p><span>Since the media felt it had the right to delve into Senator Joseph Biden's plagiarism in law school and to ridicule Rep. Dick Gephardt's record of flip-flops in the past decade, it has the responsibility to apply the same standards of scrutiny to Jackson.</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>IRST and foremost, on the 20th anniversary of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s death, the media should apply the spotlight to Jackson's highly controversial and debatable claim that he cradled a dying King in his arms. Coretta Scott King and other leaders of the civil rights movement still resent Jackson's actions during the days after King's death, especially his claim that the turtleneck he was wearing had the slain leader's blood on it. Does this show Jackson is an opportunistic showboat?</span></p> <p><span>More recently Jackson called Zionism a \"poisonous weed\". In 1984, he labelled New York \"hymietown\", and pledged support for Louis Farrakhan, who calls Judaism a \"gutter religion\". No other white candidate could have gotten away with such words and actions and remained in the race. Are these the views the American people want in the presidency?</span></p> <p><span>It may be racist to say that Jackson is not qualified to be President. But it is certainly not racist, just factually correct, to point out that he has never held any elective office. It is also not racist to remember that Jackson's Operation PUSH--an organization which seeks to advance minority businesses--has been the subject of government inquiries and been charged with mismanagement of federal funds. If Jackson has had such problems managing PUSH's budget, how does he plans to handle the federal budget?</span></p> <p><span>The media demanded that Sen. Paul Simon explain how his fanciful public works-balanced budget plan would work. In the same vein, the media should grill Jackson on how he would finance his ambitious spending proposals, which include hugh increases in everything from education to social security to farm subsidies.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson courageously has advocated increasing the tax rate for corporation and for the wealthiest Americans, has suggested withholding social security and Medicare benefits from the wealthy and has called for substantial and potentially destabilizing cuts in a host of weapons systems. But many economists, even Democratic economists, believe that this revenue will not be enough to pay for his domestic programs.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson regularly professes solidarity with the oppressed workers overseas. In international trade, however, he says he will reduce the United States' trade deficit by abolishing tax incentives for American companies that build plants abroad, under the assumption that they would then reinvest in America. But such a policy would actually hurt foreing workers, since most Third World countries simply cannot afford to pay their workers American-size wages. As another Democratic economist told the Times, such restrictions would end up \"destroying the only hope of the very people Jackson says he feels solidarity with.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>O his credit, Jackson has spoken more than any other candidate on the need to divest from South Africa and to wage an effective war on drugs. Yet other aspects of his foreign policy agenda remain highly suspect. Jackson says he will scrap a number of weapons systems, such as the MX, Midgetman, and Trident D-5 missiles, and two new aircraft carriers. He would also withdraw up to half of the U.S. troops stationed in Europe. Based on his support for the P L O and on his past anti-Semitic remarks, one must wonder to what extent Jackson will honor this nation's commitment to Israel, and how much he would criticize the Soviets for their treatment of Jewish refusniks.</span></p> <p><span>Certainly, Jackson is the most passionate and electrifying orator among this year's presidential candidates, no tough feat indeed. But being is a passionate speaker is not the sole qualification for President. After all, avowed segregationist George Wallace once won the Michigan caucuses by employing a populist \"send them a message\" approach, similar to the one Jackson is using. Wallace's message sure was passionate and sure did move people. But we can all give thanks that he was not elected.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson and his supporters have made the current election a referendum on racism, and have argued that a vote not cast for Jesse Jackson is a vote against civil rights, a vote against Martin Luther King's dream. But a far better test of America's progress in race relations is how the media and the political establishment treat a substantive, credible black candidate. So far, they have not lived up to that dream.</span></p>"}

Dukakis scored a convincing victory in the Wisconsin primary last night, cutting the Rev. Jesse Jackson's momentum in the Democratic presidential race and reaching for control in the struggle for the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>\"It was a great victory for us,\" Dukakis said, \"I hope it's a sign of things to come,\" he added, looking ahead to the New York and Pennsylvania primaries later this month.</span></p> <p><span>With returns in from 57 percent of Wisconsin's precincts, the Massachusetts governor had won 311,160 votes or 47 percent, Jackson had 197,795 votes or 30 percent, Gore 109,384 or 17 percent and Simon 31,389 or 5 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Bush was winning 85 percent of the vote, to 7 percent each for Robertson and recent campaign dropout Sen. Robert Dole (R.-Kan.)</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis also celebrated a narrow victory over Jackson in the Colorado caucuses, which were marked by a slow and controversial count. Together, Wisconsin and Colorado added to his slender lead in the competition for delegates to the Democratic National Convention.</span></p> <p><span>For the Democrats, Wisconsin turned out to be a surprisingly important test in their nominating wars, a gauge of the struggling Dukakis campaign and of Jackson's surprising monentum. It was a prelude, as well, to delegate-rich primaries in New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio just ahead.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis worked hard in the state to quell party leaders' fears over his ability to fend off Jackson and attract blue-collar votes, particularly after the governor's poor showings in Illinois and Michigan last month. His victory seems likely to reassure establishment leaders, many of whom fear that Jackson would sink the party if he won the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>For the same reason, the Dukakis victory is likely to stifle talk of drafting New York Gov. Mario Cuomo or another Democrat into the race.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson aimed for a win in a state where only 4 percent of the voters were Black, in a bid for dramatic new stature in the contest.</span></p> <p><span>The polls indicated that Jackson, who won the state's minuscule Black vote overwhelmingly, captured between 20 and 25 percent of the white vote as well. While this figure by far exceeded the 7 percent Jackson receivedin 1984, it was not enough to secure him amajority.</span></p> <p><span>He said yesterday, \"I feel good.

{"title": "What More Do They Want on Jesse? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE new fashionable point for political columnists to make is that Jesse Jackson hasn't been taken seriously--which in translation means that Jesse Jackson hasn't been run out of the campaign.</span></p> <p><span>These columnists won't put it that way. They actually claim to be doing Jackson a favor by demanding that he be scrutinizied \"fairly\" by both press and politicians. Running him out of the race by hammering him with attacks on his record and his personality are meant to be means of according him the highest honor of \"respect.\" After all Gary Hart and Joe Biden were worthy of respect, so why should Jackson be cut out? He's been given a free ride, the experts contend, and that is a form of racism.</span></p> <p><span>But the facts suggest that Jackson has been given plenty of scrutiny, that more damaging revelations have come out against him than practically any other candidate in the race for the Democratic nomination.</span></p> <p><span>In a long piece in Vanity Fair some months ago, Gail Sheehy recounted: Jackson's brother's shady dealings, the finagling at Operation PUSH, allegations of womanizing, his misrepresentations concerning the death of Martin Luther King, Jr., his hailing of Castro and embracing of Arafat, and his lack of any background in politics. To conclude the piece, Sheehy suggested that Jackson was too egotistical to be president.</span></p> <p><span>Other reporters have suggested that Jackson left the University of Illinois only after academic troubles and not because of the racist atmosphere Jackson claims existed. On Candidates '88, Marvin Kalb interviewed Jackson just like everyone else. So did David Frost on the Making of the President. In a Boston debate, local television reporter Andy Hiller pointedly challenged Jackson's record with regard to Jews and Israel. And early in the campaign, reporters put Jackson in the headlines for lending his face to an advertisement for a business school, forcing him to apologize and withdraw his endorsement.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>CTUALLY, Jackson has been subject to unusual levels of scrutiny. The 1984 hymietown flap only became news when a Washington Post reporter decided to print the remarks made off the record. That incident has appeared in virtually every Jackson profile piece this year, as has his association with Farrakhan.</span></p> <p><span>Now it is true that in the beginning of this year's campaign Jackson was not drawing much scrutiny, but then again he wasn't drawing much attention by anyone, period. You have to be winning to be scrutinized--unless as Joe Biden learned, another candidate has it in for you. The white candidates who supposedly have been under the gun of scrutiny so far all were doing well at the polls at the time. Gephardt's trade policy and his flip-flopping on the issues--notably abortion--came under fire only after his victory in Iowa. Gary Hart drew the spotlight of the Miami Herald because he was the front-runner. Paul Simon was quizzed on how his budget would add up only after he edged out Dukakis in Iowa.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson finished fourth in both Iowa and New Hampshire. If you remember, Jackson did not prove himself to be a strong contender until Super Tuesday, and furthermore he had already been scrutinized four years before, and scrutinized strongly. Only in the last few weeks has Jackson done well enough to merit scrutiny. And as has been the case with his white rivals, Jackson's rise in the polls has been accompanied by increased scrutiny by the press. The New York Times and The New Republic have both recently printed articles raising questions about his record and his positions. The Washington Post this past Sunday torturously went over Jackson's claim that he cradled the dead King in his arms. And Jackson's letter to Noriega has been publicized sufficiently enough perhaps to prevent him from winning Wisconsin.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T could be that columnists may not know the facts when they say that Jackson has had a free ride because he is Black. But it is more likely that the cry for Jackson to be taken seriously really amounts to a gasp of exasperation that a man who has been so heavily scrutinized, who has been the subject of so much negative publicity, continues to win.</span></p> <p><span>The reason Jackson has been able to survive scrutiny--a thought columnists seem loathe to acknowledge--is that he, unlike virtually any other Democrat now running, has a loyal and well-defined constituency. Historian Alan Brinkley noted in The New York Times at the time of the Hart scandal that his campaign was mortally wounded by the Donna Rice affair precisely because he lacked a constituency. Hart was trading on his front-runner status and nothing more. The same could be said of Joe Biden. For a candidate without a natural constituency, any damaging revelation can bring a campaign to an end.</span></p> <p><span>But Jackson, as he proved in 1984 after the hymietown incident, has sufficiently strong backing from a sufficiently large group of voters to withstand the occasional damaging story. Brinkley noted that the phenomenon of the constituent-less candidate was a relatively new and not particularly encouraging one. Jackson is throwback to an earlier political landscape, when candidates ran because people wanted them to, not just because they thought they should be president.</span></p> <p><span>So in the end, the recent argument that Jackson has been given a free ride and that such indifference to him is a subtle form of racism, may itself be racist. Ignoring the fact that Jackson's record <i>has</i> been scrutinized, the argument assumes that Jackson is only doing well because no one has made it clear how awful he is. But couldn't it be that plenty of people--and virtually all Black voters--have heard all the revelations about Jackson and all of his left wing political positions and still like him? Or does it make more sense to say that the people are ignorant and must be educated properly? After all, if some worthy journalist doesn't take it upon himself to educate them, Jesse Jackson just might be elected president.</span></p>"}

This Spaceman is running for the Presidency of the United States.</span></p> <p><span>Most people have probably never heard of Bill Lee, a former southpaw pitcher for the Boston Red Sox and later the Montreal Expos. Lee, nicknamed \"The Spaceman\" by his teammates and the local press for his eccentricity and outrageous antics, is the standard-bearer of the newly-formed American wing of the Rhinoceros Party. Running on a slogan of \"No guns, no butter--they'll both kill ya,\" Lee represents a satirical political party based in Canada. More than 100,000 of our Northern neighbors voted Rhino in 1984.</span></p> <p><span>With recent political returns in this country making it more likely that George Bush and Michael Dukakis will be the two major party candidates in the fall, America needs Bill Lee--if only for the simple reason that he has a personality. He's not a very serious candidate--he hopes to abolish the law of gravity, for instance--but he often makes too much sense to be dismissed as a simple joker.</span></p> <p><span>I got to meet Bill Lee when I was eleven years old. He was my hero even then. My father and I sat next to him in a local pub, watching him swill beer and listening to him talk about Eastern mysticism and the concept of infinity. No doubt my admiration for such an odd figure was disturbing to my parents. Lee had admitted to being a frequent user of marijuana, and to avoid penalty from the Baseball Commission for smoking it, he fabricated a story of sprinkling pot on his organic buckwheat pancakes. The THC, he claimed, would be activated in his bloodstream as he jogged to practice. Then-baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn never did figure out if he could charge Lee with anything.</span></p> <p><span><b>L</b>EE is still a frequent user of drugs. He even took some painkillers from a member of the audience, which he drank down with one of the many Corona beers he consumed during his performance. In fact, Lee's campaign platform calls for the legalization of drugs. He praised some Florida residents he had recently met who wore T-shirts with the slogan, \"Save the Bales.\"</span></p> <p><span>For George Bush, loyalty is refusing to disagree with an incompetent president--loyalty is hiding. For Bill Lee, loyalty is standing up. Shortly before being traded to Montreal in 1978, Lee went on a one-day strike when friend and teammate Bernie Carbo was sold to Cleveland for $15,000. The press and many fans criticized Lee for his walkout, but he stood firm and still defends his actions.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's a form of protesting,\" he says. \"You've got to stick up for your friends. I never held out for money. I rebel for nothing but the truth.\"</span></p> <p><span>On international relations, Lee offers a refreshingly simple perspective. \"I see the world as a planet, not a checkerboard,\" he says. \"I think we should do away with boundaries. I don't like borders. Everytime you stop, they check your trunk.\"</span></p> <p><span>To solve tension in the Middle East, Lee proposes to merge all the nations in the area and rename them either Pasrael or Isaelstein, thereby eliminating the major cause for the violence and strife now taking place.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike some of the other candiates, Lee is not a lifetime bureaucrat. The political process is far too tedious a game for Lee, who offers practical solutions. \"If someone's doing something wrong,\" he says, \"slap him upside the head and tell him he's full of shit.\" Lee, a long-time vegetarian, explains he means that literally--that some people, specifically those who eat red meat, actually are full of it.</span></p> <p><span>Lee talked a lot about prophets Tuesday night; the crowd seemed to think of him as one. He named Martin Luther King, Jr. and the character of Elias in the hit movie Platoon as meeting his definition of prophets, meaning \"someone who says something unfavorable, jeopardizing their own life.\" Lee's determined irreverance and outspokeness have never jeopardized his life, but as he admits, \"I could've pitched until I was 45 years old if I was just born without a tongue.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bill Lee is no prophet. He's just a regular guy who speaks his mind. Most people never get to meet their heroes, and when they do they are usually disappointed. That's because they look too high and too far away. All I did was a look a little bit askew, and I found a spaceman who earned my vote for President.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Harvard's Coalition Building Pays Off | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>After a long battle with the Reagan Administration over information controls, Harvard and the higher education community appear to be winning the battle for freedom of scientific information.</span></p> <p><span>In the name of national security, the Reagan Administration has spent the last seven years attempting to limit the free exchange of scientific research. The Administration has expanded controls on the publication of scientific research, attempted to impose prepublication reviews of research results, broadened the classification of information and limited the exchange of knowledge with overseas scholars.</span></p> <p><span>Led by Harvard Vice President for Government and Community Affairs John Shattuck, higher education officials have fought these policies on the grounds that they jeopardize academic freedom. Furthermore, the educators argue, such restrictions weaken scientific research, handicap the American economy and seriously damage national security in the long run.</span></p> <p><span>Now, other interests are joining the educators' call for a less restrictive information policy. To Congress, the Iran-contra affair revealed the dangers of excessive government secrecy. Businessmen concerned about America's economic \"competitiveness\" have also mounted an attack on the Administration's controls. They argue that the failure to share scientific information has weakened the United States' ability to match foreign business innovations and will lead to economic stagnation.</span></p> <p><span>Changes within the Reagan Administration have also moderated the Administration's insistence on secrecy. A number of hard-line policy makers have left the Administration, and the prospect of a further U.S.-USSR arms treaty has led President Reagan and other officials to tone down their anti-Soviet rhetoric.</span></p> <p><span>As a result, the Reagan restrictive information policies appear to be losing ground. Congress is likely to balk at further attempts to keep a lid on scientific research--particularly in the field of superconductivity--congressional aides say.</span></p> <p><span>\"The outlook is improving for a relaxation of some of the restrictions on the communication of science and technology that have been imposed during the past decade,\" says a report released late last month by Shattuck and Harvard Policy Analyst Muriel Morisey Spence '69.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, education officials say, the issue of information restriction could be a major one in the up coming fall presidential campaign, since it has tremendous ramifications on economic growth, foreign policy, and the way the government formulates policy. They point out that the issues of government secrecy and information restriction played a prominent role in the Democratic candidates' debates throughout last winter and will likely become important topics in the fall campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\"The two principle topics of the upcoming campaign are going to be economic growth and competitiveness and the challenges of foreign policy and national security,\" Shattuck says. \"The issue of government information controls is central to both of those topics.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"It's already entered the Democratic candidates' lexicons,\" says Thomas S. Blanton '77-79, director of planning and research for the National Security Archives (NSA), a Washington-based organization that seeks to declassify information.</span></p> <p><span>Every Democratic candidate has come out in favor of more open government and fewer restriction on scientific information, in part as a result of the Iran-contra scandal. On the Republican side, however, Vice President George Bush has not separated himself from the Reagan Administration's policies. Nonetheless, analysts believe Bush may have to change his stance.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think we're going to see both candidates trying to put some distance between themselves and the Administration,\" Shattuck says.</span></p> <p><span><b>Implications for Scientific Research</b></span></p> <p><span>At stake in this debate, educators say, is America's position in scientific research and in the world economy.</span></p> <p><span>Higher education officials argue that science works best in an open atmosphere, and that too many restrictions lead to a stagnation of basic science. Pointing to the Warsaw Pact countries, scientists argue that their economic stagnation is a result of government restrictions on scientific communication. If the United States continues to restrict the free flow of science and technology, it will ultimately weaken America's position on the cutting edge of research, critics say.</span></p> <p><span>The Reagan policy of information restrictions \"has appeared somewhat threatening\" to scientific research, says Harvard Director of Governmental Relations Parker L. Coddington. \"Once you start creating fences, you don't help yourself in the [technological] race,\" Coddington says.</span></p> <p><span>\"If we kept basic research under wraps, [foreign scientists] would make these discoveries soon enough in Japan to beat us to market, soon enough in the Soviet Union to beat us to space,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span><b>Protecting National Security</b></span></p> <p><span>But not every one agrees that sharing scientific discoveries with foreign researchers is in America's best interest.</span></p> <p><span>To the Reagan Administration, the free flow of information can seriously jeopardize the United States' national security. For the past seven years, the Administration has adhered to a \"mosaic\" view of national security information, a theory that says that even bits and pieces of seemingly harmless data can be pieced together by our adversaries in such a manner that it would jeopardize our national security.</span></p> <p><span>\"In the 1980s `national security' is in itself an all-encompassing term too often construed as having to do only with foreign policy and defense matters. In reality, it must include virtually every facet of international activity, including foreign affairs, defense, intelligence, research, and development policy, outer space, [and] international economic and trade policy,\" former National Security Advisor Richard V. Allen wrote in a 1983 report.</span></p> <p><span>In defending the mosaic theory, Administration officials often cite a 1979 article describing how to build a hydrogen bomb, which drew only on unclassified information scattered through a number of scientific journals.</span></p> <p><span>\"The presumption in previous administrations was that this information should not be classified unless it would cause discernible harm,\" Blanton says. \"The presumption in the Reagan Administration has been that this stuff shouldn't be released.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"The burden of proof was with the classifier [in the Carter Administration]. Now it's almost turned around,\" Coddington says.</span></p> <p><span>Those who oppose the Reagan restrictions argue that the Administration is hiding behind the mosaic theory to prevent scrutiny of its policies. \"The intent of that argument is to have the discretionary power to limit information,\" Blanton says. \"What they're trying to do is to get a free pass on classifying information to avoid embarrassment\"</span></p> <p><span>In addition, critics argue that the restrictions cannot succeed, because sophisticated intelligence gatherers are able to piece together scientific information despite strict controls. \"What any researcher worth their salt does is construct mosaics,\" Blanton says</span></p> <p><span>Critics of the Reagan Administration's information policies have looked to Harvard for leadership. During the past several years, Shattuck and Harvard have led the crusade to roll back the Administration's information restrictions.</span></p> <p><span>Experts say that a July 1985 report by Shattuck entitled \"On the Free Flow of Information and Ideas\", which attacked the Administration's efforts, inspired the higher education community to unite against the Administration's policies of information restriction.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard and Shattuck form \"a pretty unbeatable combination,\" Blanton says. Shattuck \"is the first person people on Capitol Hill turn to on this issue.\"</span></p> <p><span>Harvard's Office of Sponsored Research oversees all scientific projects which receive outside funding. The office enforces Harvard's rules against government controls on research and prevents Harvard scientists from accepting strictures--such as prepublication review--that would severely limit their freedom to share their results.</span></p> <p><span>However, many other universities do not have the capacity to create similar watchdog groups and often can not afford to forgo badly needed federal funds. Unlike most universities, Harvard can afford to turn down federally funded projects that curtail the sharing of information.</span></p> <p><span>The University can therefore take the lead in challenging the Administration's policies. \"It's terribly important that there be institutions like Harvard and Stanford to set a clear precedent for other universities,\" says Dr. Robert M. Rosenzweig, President of the Association of American Universities (AAU), an umbrella group that represents the nation's 54 major research universities. \"It's really important that institutions be clear about these policies.\"</span></p> <p><span>Harvard officials insist, however, that they are not trying to encroach on other universities and establish policies that all must follow. \"We're certainly not trying to tell other universities how to behave,\" Shattuck says. \"That is the role the AAU should play.\"</span></p> <p><span>Instead, Shattuck says, Harvard has built a coalition that opposes the Administration's information restrictions. \"We have analyzed the secrecy policies and criticized them, brought them to the attention of Congress and other universities,\" Shattuck says of Harvard's role.</span></p> <p><span>When Shattuck and other lobbyists began rallying the opposition to the restrictions on scientific communication, the scientific community was among the first to respond. Scientists are \"even more unified now in the realization that you have to have a free flow of information,\" Blanton says.</span></p> <p><span>\"Secrecy makes it very hard to do research,\" says Dean of the Division of Applied Sciences Paul C. Martin '52. \"Scientific research depends on communication.\"</span></p> <p><span>Scientists have particularly objected to the Administration's attempts to limit their ability to collaborate with their foreign counterparts. The National Science Foundation has drafted research guidelines--and submitted them to the Reagan Administration--that would allow foreign scientists to have access to American supercomputers.</span></p> <p><span>In the past, the Congress has not been able to opppose Reagan's policy effectively and has allowed the Administration a relatively free hand, analysts say. \"For the most part, Congress has not figured out ways to rein in the executive branch in these areas,\" Blanton says.</span></p> <p><span>But the Iran-contra scandal and fears of economic decline have prompted a change, and the Congress has joined the fight for free exchange of information, observers say.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is not any protectionist sentiment of this kind in Congress right now,\" Coddington says.</span></p> <p><span>The Administration's recent efforts to prevent superconductivity laboratories from sharing their findings with foreign scientists have come under attack from the scientific community and are unlikely to pass through Congress, lobbyists say.</span></p> <p><span>Such restrictions \"are stupid and self-defeating,\" Blanton says, adding that the legislation is \"not going to go anywhere\" in Congress.</span></p> <p><span>\"It just seemed damned stupid\" to impose such restrictions, Coddington says, terming the Administration's proposed legislation \"an example of thoughtless foolishness.\" We weren't hiding anything from anyone.\"</span></p> <p><span>Prompted by fear that the United States' products are not competitive in the world market, economic experts, too, have joined the fight to ease information restrictions.</span></p> <p><span>Their ire has been aroused particularly by the way the Administration has applied the 1979 Export Administration Act. Enacted primarily to regulate the overseas export of goods and machinery, the law has increasingly been used to restrict the communication of technical information and ideas within the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>These export controls have had direct economic consequences, scientists charge. A report by the National Academy of Sciences issued in April 1987 says that the Administration's interpretation of the export control laws costs the country 188,000 jobs and $9 billion a year and has been a major factor contributing to the nation's record trade deficit.</span></p> <p><span>There is \"growing evidence that restrictions in science and technology are very damaging to this nation's economy,\" Shattuck says.</span></p> <p><span>Now that the U.S. trade deficit has become a matter of concern, businessmen and Reagan's own economic advisers are challenging the information restrictions.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan's advisers \"see it as absolutely necessary to recover market share for their own individual businesses and for America's economic health,\" Coddington says. \"That whole system [of export controls] has been vigorously opposed by people in the Commerce Department.\"</span></p> <p><span>Even though they believe they are winning the fight against the Reagan Administration's policies, education officials say they will continue to press their case to the next President and to the next session of Congress.</span></p> <p><span>Shattuck's March 31 report calls on the next President to \"signal a shift in policy\" by issuing an executive order within its first 100 days loosening the classification and export control strictures. The 41 st President's agenda should be premised on \"principles that justify the revision of the existing system of controls,\" the report says.</span></p> <p><span>\"The free flow of information and ideas is vital to the fabric of our national life,\" the Shattuck report concludes. \"Government policy aimed at broadly controlling the communication of information and ideas is ultimately self-defeating and may soon become irreparably damaging unless it is substantially revised by the next President.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"We'll have a program to present to Congress,\" Rosenzweig said.</span></p> <p><span>However, education officials say they recognize that the question of government classification of some scientific research is unavoidable and they say the fight will go on. \"I'm not certain that we're going to see a great rollback in secrecy restrictions,\" Shattuck said.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Boys and Sports | Sports | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The first image is a young boy on a Sunday morning. Sprawled on the living room floor, the boy pores over pages of newsprint. Numbers. Statistics. All the arcane lore contained in the sports section. It is a group ritual. The boy looks up occasionally to share a dramatically improved ERA with his father. The father, lolling on the couch with the Business section, responds with animation. \"That reminds me of the 1955 Dodgers. What a season...\"</span></p> <p><span>The picture shifts to a large lecture hall on a Tuesday morning. The professor drones on about the reification of post-Kantian theories of kitsch. A student sinks back in his seat. The Globe sports section has replaced notetaking. His pen traces patterns around the box scores. The numbers recall the sensational double play in the bottom of the fifth of last night's Padres-Mariners game.</span></p> <p><span>The final scene is an early-morning meeting at one of those places that caters to the new \"power breakfast\" crowd. Several businessmen, just off the 6 a.m. shuttle, gather around a table. Before they get started, one man says, \"could you believe the game last night. That Winfield homer was about a mile outside the park.\" The other men look up from their coffee, the edge of caffeine and sports giving an automatic adrenelin rush. An hour later they leave the restaurant, the deal unclosed, but secure in the knowledge that the Yankees have tied up the pennant.</span></p> <p><span>A common thread binds these three images. Sports, as many women have observed, is the secret language of men. It binds--and bonds--men together in ways that most women don't understand. Certainly there are some women who read The Sporting News, and some men who can't live without a copy of Women's Wear Daily. But for the most part sports plays a uniquely male role in our society; it teaches men competition and camaraderie, team play and individual excellence.</span></p> <p><span>The hackneyed television beer commercial--Bob Uecker, Billy Martin and John Madden for Miller Lite--demonstrates the appeal of men sitting around in a bar, watching football and baseball, just being \"one of the guys.\" Beer companies have fully recognized the selling power of the sports-as-male-bonding phenomenon.</span></p> <p><span>The process of indoctrination is gradual. Boys start out under their fathers' tutelage, going to the ball-park on Bat Day and Hat Day. They play Little League and start collecting baseball cards. And they start reading the sports pages.</span></p> <p><span>It is the sports pages--particularly The Globe's--that unite men across generational boundaries. The little boy sprawled on the floor Sunday morning and the business executive share a common passion--the arcania of baseball, the trivia of football, the violence of hockey.</span></p> <p><span>In a sense, the reading of the sports section is a tribal rite of passage for men, indicating that they, too, will take their place among the armchair major leaguers and couch potato/homerun hitters. Grownup men never seem to lose their fantasy of major league status, even if the closest they ever came was a hit with the bases loaded in second grade Little League.</span></p> <p><span>Politicians regularly employ sports metaphors to get their points across, to ensure the voters that they are just \"regular\" guys. Even George Bush, vice president and candidate with the wimp factor, was captain of Yale's baseball team. And after his 1984 debate with Geraldine Ferraro, he indulged in some spontaneous male bonding with a group of dockworkers. \"We kicked some ass,\" he said. The sports allusion, as well as the sexist content, of his remark is clear.</span></p> <p><span>The same is true of Ronald Reagan's \"win one for the Gipper\" appeal. Voting has become the extension of a sporting event. And after all, the political news is in the same paper as the sports section.</span></p> <p><span><i>Susan is an editor in the News Department.

{"title": "Questioning Jesse's Credentials | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>F</b>OR months, Ronald Reagan has sat in the White House, itching to enter the presidential fray. Finally this week he decided to let a partisan opinion escape his lips, irritated by the media's gentle treatment of Democratic candidate Jesse Jackson.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan's point is a valid one. Not only does the press refuse to closely analyze the Jackson candidacy, it seems to be conspiring to make Jackson into an overnight sensation.</span></p> <p><span>Who is Jesse Jackson? Why does he think he deserves to be president? The press answers with eliches when we want facts.</span></p> <p><span>How is it possible that a major candidate can remain unknown despite more than four years of media attention? For example, the media frequently does no more than gloss over the fact that Jackson has never held an elected office before. Yet if Jackson receives the nomination for either president or vice president, his lack of political credentials will be almost unique in modern U.S. politics.</span></p> <p><span>Only twice since the Second World War has a major party nominated someone who had never held the position of governor, president, vice president, U.S. senator, or U.S. representative.</span></p> <p><span>The last time this happened was in 1972 when Sargent Shriver ran on George McGovern's Democratic ticket against President Richard Nixon. Shriver had never held elected office before.</span></p> <p><span>But before you prop up the Shriver case as a precedent to a Jackson nomination, there are some facts to consider. Shriver received the nod from McGovern only after his initial running mate, Senator Thomas Eagleton, had been forced to withdraw his name. Reporters had discovered that Eagleton had received shock treatments for emotional disorders.</span></p> <p><span>Also, although Shriver had never been elected to an office before, he had demonstrated his political and administrative experience as Kennedy's director of the Peace Corps, an aide to Johnson, and Ambassador to France.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson supporters who hope to use the Shriver example might also consider the fate of the McGovern-Shriver ticket--it lost by the biggest landslide vote in presidential history.</span></p> <p><span>The only other time a nominee had never held an elected office before was in 1952. Yes, Dwight Eisenhowever had never held an elected office before he ran successfully for president in 1952.</span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>OWEVER. Jackson doesn't stack up very well in a comparison with Eisenhower, lke was a tremendously popular and well-known war hero who had demonstrated his administrative abilities--first as the commander of the allied troops in the European Theater during World War II, and later as head of NATO troops.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson, on the other hand, has repeatedly shown his lack of administrative ability. His Operation PUSH in Chicago was notoriously disorganized, as was his 1984 campaign. His 1988 effort is only marginally better.</span></p> <p><span>The press interprets Jackson's improved electoral success in 1988 as the sign of a new Jackson--one who has broadened his appeal to poor whites and liberal yuppies. Or so the story goes.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, Jackson's success is more the result of a different field of Democratic challengers. In 1984 Walter Mondale was the favorite son of the Democratic Party--he had served as vice president for four years. He had been an influential legislator in the Congress. He had strongly supported civil rights legislation. His appeal to the Blacks and poorer whites was as strong, if not stronger, than Jackson's.</span></p> <p><span>In 1988, there are no challengers to Jackson in his natural political bases. He is by far the most liberal of the serious candidates, so it is logical that some liberal yuppies and poorer whites will vote for him. Indeed, Dukakis and Gore are trying to make themselves appear more moderate so as to attract conservative Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>Neither Dukakis, Gore, nor any of the has-beens can reproduce Mondale's special appeal to Blacks. Their particular needs, and the fact that only Jackson addresses them, explains much of his success this year.</span></p> <p><span>Despite these facts, the press continues to establish a Jackson myth. Although the facts show that Jackson is no more qualified to be president than he was in 1984, we are forced to read stories of a Jackson candidacy that must be taken seriously. Jesse Jackson is the same man, with the same lack of credentials, he was in 1984. Too many unanswered questions remain.</span></p>"}

Yesterday wasn't so much a Dukakis win, as the rest of the pack's loss.</span></p> <p><span>Both Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado and Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware brought top Senate experience, from foreign policy to justice. Then Hart slept his way into the mass media and out of the race. Biden barely made it into the media, until he plagiarized enough to be kicked out of the race.</span></p> <p><span>Rep. Richard Gephardt's (D--Missouri) politics of resentment and trade walls played well in Iowa but fell flat on the more integrated and tradedependent Northeast. Sen. Paul Simon's (D-Illinois) brand of populism was equally anachronistic.</span></p> <p><span>Sen. Albert J. Gore Jr. '69 of Tennessee entered the race with the most foreign policy experience of any candidate, sharp debating skills and an attractive television presence. Yet his regionalism, which handed him the Deep South Super Tuesday, slapped him into obscurity in the rest of the country. Ed Koch was virutally the only New Yorker who knew him.</span></p> <p><span>The Rev. Jesse Jackson inspired the poor and liberal intellectuals, while cornering the Black vote, rivalling the Duke for a time. In the end, however, his lack of government experience and his past anti-semitic associations torpedoed his hopes for the White House.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HAT left Dukakis, the clean and simple candidate. He didn't run on any issues, nor did he wield the eloquence or sharpness of his competitors. He said he was pro-Israel, but refused to commit to specific plan for peace. He promised to recreate the Massachusetts Miracle nationwide, but failed to outline fiscal reforms beyond more stringent tax collection. Instead, he \"stayed above the political strife\" and presented himself as the only competent candidate with no outstanding faults.</span></p> <p><span>Faced with the alternatives, Democratic voters picked the man who was least offensive. Thought Dukakis was not terribly inspirational, at least he was palatable. In this race, that was unique.</span></p> <p><span>But beating Bush will not be so easy. With only two candidates, the governor will no longer be able to let his competitors fight off each other while he remains above the strife. One on one with Bush, Dukakis will have to hold his own. And with the two running dead even in the polls, Bush will not go down without a fight.</span></p> <p><span>Bush embodies many of the skills that Dukakis's Democratic opponents did and that Dukakis lacks. Bush has a strong command of the issues, including foreign policy, and national government experience. A skilled debater, Bush promises to put Dukakis on the spot when they go head-to-head this fall.</span></p> <p><span>Besides boasting cross-regional support, Bush is running on the coattails of the most popular president in history. Despite controversy over the Iran-Contra affair and Attorney General Edwin Meese, Reagan's support in November could well push bush over the top.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>O Dukakis can't beat Bush by default. His victory will depend on decision--to take the initiative and tackle the issues.</span></p> <p><span>To win over the voters in the swing states, Dukakis can't rely on his record as a capable leader. A well-crafted attack on Bush's weakest spot--his role in the Iran-Contra affair--may be enough to bring down his candidacy. But Dukakis shouldn't count on it. He must show that his policy in office would be a far better alternative to four more years of Republican rule.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis ought to make farm policy a central issue of the debates if he hopes to win Illinois and the Midwest. If he has any hopes of taking states like Florida away from the Vice President, he must make his universal health-care policies a bulwark of his platform. He has to set out concrete initiatives on crises ripping their way into the media and Congress, such as Central American strife and the federal deficit.</span></p> <p><span>Americans won't come to Dukakis, Dukakis will have to go to them.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Ivory Platforms | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>All of a sudden, education is a major campaign issue in the 1988 race.</span></p> <p><span>Whereas in previous years, education took a back seat to domestic issues, voter concern about the nation's economic decline and skyrocketing tuitions have propelled it to the forefront of every candidate's agenda.</span></p> <p><span>Education as a way to improve international economic competition is among many candidates' top themes.</span></p> <p><span>\"There are a whole lot of subsets of issues within the competitiveness issue,\" says Charles Saunders, vice president for governmental relations of the American Council on Education (ACE). Candidates stress education because study after study reveals that \"education is one of the keys\" to restoring American competitiveness, Saunders says.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's a subject matter of almost universal concern,\" says Mitchell Daniels, president of the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. \"There's genuine alarm about year after year of rotten performance.\"</span></p> <p><span>Higher education officials say the debate over education traditionally helped Democrats because it centered around expanding educational opportunity for all students and on levels of federal financial assistance necessary to do so. However, rising college costs and recent sweeping attacks from such critics as Allan Bloom on the quality and content of college teaching have refocused the debate more along lines that Republicans prefer, on issues such as quality and \"accountability.\"</span></p> <p><span>On several major principles, the candidates are saying much the same thing. Each pledges to place education among his top domestic priorities as President. Each argues that investing in education is vital to improve the United States' international economic fortunes and to ensure that all students have access to a college education, regardless of their income.</span></p> <p><span>At the same time, however, several demand explanations from colleges about the way they spend their spiraling tuitions and advocate various forms of savings plans to help parents cope with these rising costs.</span></p> <p><span>Yet despite all of the candidates' self-proclaimed support for education, higher education officials are worried that their commitment will not extend much beyond this election, and are therefore urging candidates to describe their plans more specifically.</span></p> <p><span>\"We will be looking for more in-depth proposals for higher education, not just platitudes,\" says Saunders of ACE. Saunders says that it would be \"disturbing if they [the candidates] were using it as a God and motherhood issue.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>TGIF</b></span></p> <p><span>With the hope of forcing candidates to make specific pledges, a commission of 31 higher education leaders, chaired by William C. Friday, President Emeritus of the University of North Carolina, released a comprehensive report in December on the state of higher education in America.</span></p> <p><span>Entitled \"A Memorandum to the 41st President of the United States,\" the report urges the next president to return the federal government to its former close partnership with higher education, provide incentives for research to help restore economic competitiveness, and increase federal grants for student financial aid.</span></p> <p><span>The Friday Commission hopes \"to lay out the kinds of issues we believe are the most important for higher education,\" says Saunders, the executive director for the commission.</span></p> <p><span>\"Simon and Dole have gone into some detail on their proposals,\" Saunders says. \"Most of the rest have been speaking in general terms.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>The following is a brief summary of what thecandidates are saying on higher education issues,collected from speeches, position papers, andinterviews with campaign officials:</b></span></p> <p><span><b>Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis:</b>Dukakis speaks frequently about the numerouseducation initiatives he undertook as governor,such as the Boston Compact, between the city'sbusiness community and local schools. AsPresident, Dukakis says he would end Secretary ofEducation William J. Bennett's assault on theGuaranteed Student Loan (GSL) and Work-Studyprograms, federal programs targeted for low andmiddle-income students.</span></p> <p><span>He also would encourage states to createcollege opportunity and tuition pre-payment plansin order to allow parents to pool their resourcesinto special interest-bearing accounts. Inaddition, in order to reduce the student loandefaults, which reached $11.1 billion in this pastyear, the Duke advocates an Education InsuranceFund, which would complement the existing GSLprogram and link repayment to the size of eachstudent's future earnings.<c></c></span></p> <p><span><b>The Rev. Jesse Jackson:</b> The RainbowCoalition leader pledges to double the federaleducation budget, and calls expansion ofgovernment tuition subsidies the best way to bringup the decreasing minority enrollment levels inUnited States colleges. \"Higher education must beseen as a right, and not a privilege, in ournation,\" he says.<c></c></span></p> <p><span><b>Rep. Richard Gephardt (D.-Mo.):</b> Gephardtproposes the creation of new IndividualDevelopment and Education Accounts (IDEA) whichwould let parents open savings accounts for theirchildren's education with the federal governmentproviding matching funds, based on a formula tiedto income level.<c></c></span></p> <p><span><b>Sen. Albert J. Gore, Jr. '69 (D.-Tenn.):</b>\"On election night, I would send a telegram to theSecretary of Education, William Bennett, and tellhim to start cleaning out his desk,\" Gore recentlytold a University of North Carolina audience.Nevertheless, he does not rule out SecretaryBennett's proposal of linking Federal assistanceto colleges to \"some kind of responsibleperformance at controlling [tuition] costs.\"</span></p> <p><span>Regarded as an effective advocate of educationissues in his years in Congress, the TennesseeSenator has repeatedly denounced theAdministration's attempts to restrict federalfinancial aid and to shift the bulk of this aidfrom grants to repayable loans for creating a\"crisis of access\" to the nation's colleges anduniversities.</span></p> <p><span><b>Sen. Paul Simon (D.-Ill.):</b> Simon claimsto have put more education laws on the books thanall of the other presidential candidates of bothparties combined. Simon has been a leadingadvocate of higher education programs during hisyears in Congress and boasts that his interest ineducation \"is not simply an election-yearcommitment.\"</span></p> <p><span>As Chairman of the Subcommittee onPostsecondary Education and a member of otherCongressional committees dealing with educationissues, Simon has helped win legislative battlesfor protecting and expanding student aid funding,creating the Department of Education, andstrengthening minority education. Of all thecandidates, Simon has the highest lifetime rankingfrom the National Education Association (88percent). Like the other Democratic candidates,Simon has denounced the Reagan budget cuts, andwants to reverse the trend away from grants andtowards repayable loans.<c></c></span></p> <p><span><b>Vice President George Bush:</b> Bush pledgesto become the \"Education President.\" He isstriving to disassociate himself from theAdministration's past policy of slashing federalaid to students, and says he favors continuedfederal funding for college work-study and forgrant programs to low-income students.</span></p> <p><span>Partly in response to pressure from Bush,Secretary Bennett announced last month that theadministration was abandoning its attempts todrastically reduce the Pell Grant and GSL programsand eliminate College Work-Study. In addition, theVice President wants to establish a CollegeSavings Plan which would allow parents to put awaytax-free dollars for their children's collegeeducation.<c></c></span></p> <p><span><b>Sen. Bob Dole (R.-Kan.):</b> The senator wasone of the original sponsors of a savings planbased on the Individual Retirement Account model.He has also advocated selective aid to collegesand universities to support their research, and,along the lines suggested in the FridayCommission's Report, says that the federalgovernment must further enlist universities tohelp restore American competitiveness. Although hesays he supports continued funding for the PellGrant progam and GSLs, he says they must betargeted to those who need them most.<c></c></span></p> <p><span><b>Rep. Jack Kemp (R.-NY):</b> Like Bush andDole, Kemp favors the idea of educational savingsplans modelled on IRAs to enable middle classfamilies to stay ahead of rapidly rising collegecosts. He says he has opposed the Reagan budgetcuts, and supports continuing GSL and otherfederal programs to ensure equal access to thenation's colleges.<c></c></span></p> <p><span><b>Pat Robertson:</b> The former televisionevangelist has argued for \"fair price policies\" tosubject colleges to market forces, which he sayswill lead to lower overhead costs and moreproductive faculties. Like other Republicancandidates, the former television evangelistadvocates a long-term investment vehicle, similarto individual retirement accounts (IRAs), to givetax breaks to parents saving for college. He hasalso called for a system of low-interest loansadministered in a way to ensure that more of themget paid back, though he has not laid out thespecifics to this proposal. One proposal, inparticular, distinguishes Robertson from all theother aspirants: he is the only one who wants toabolish the Department of Education.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Department of Education was created as theonly cabinet-level division ever directed to onelabor union,\" he says in one speech. \"I'd take thewhole thing out.\"<c></c></span></p>"}

{"title": "Taking Charge | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Professor of Law Susan R. Estrich knew it would take a lot of politicking to revive the damaged candidacy of Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis when campaign manager John Sasso resigned last October.</span></p> <p><span>Then again, politics was Estrich's game.</span></p> <p><span>And when Estrich took over for Sasso, who left his post after he admitted to sabotaging the campaign of Sen. Joseph Biden (D--Del.), the Dukakis campaign recovered rapidly.</span></p> <p><span>\"Susan is someone who has been in the campaign since the beginning,\" Dukakis spokesman Christopher Akey says. \"It was a very smooth transition when she came in because everybody here already knew her. She's firmly in control.\"</span></p> <p><span>Estrich first worked for Dukakis on his 1982 gubernatorial victory over Edward J. King, and has been a part of the Dukakis presidential campaign since he declared his candidacy last March.</span></p> <p><span>\"She is a very able person and has a lot of experience,\" Law School Dean James Vorenberg '49 says. \"I assume she was picked because the Governor thinks so highly of her.\"</span></p> <p><span>Estrich is no rookie in national politics, either. The erstwhile professor served as deputy national issues director during the 1980 presidential campaign of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54 (D--Mass.). Four years later, she worked for former Vice President Walter Mondale's presidential campaign as a senior policy advisor.</span></p> <p><span>Her experience is not limited to candidates. Estrich has been a prominent figure in the Democratic National Committee since serving on the the platform committee in 1984. She also co-chaired the 1985 Democratic Fairness Commission, which set the rules for this year's primary race.</span></p> <p><span>\"She was selected because she is brilliant, very good with people, and has an amazing amount of political experience,\" says Professor of Law Phillip B. Heymann.</span></p> <p><span>But experience doesn't count for everything, and Estrich took her position at a potentially disastrous point in the Dukakis campaign. Sasso, a long-time friend and advisor of the Massachusetts governor, had resigned after admitting he distributed a videotape of several apparently plagiarized Biden speeches. The tape forced that candidate to withdraw from the race.</span></p> <p><span>Quickly affirming that Sasso would no longer be involved with the campaign and that she had not known of the sabotage, Estrich pushed the campaign beyond the scandal and attracted public attention to issues of policy.</span></p> <p><span>\"I intend to ensure that this campaign meets the very high standards that Mike Dukakis has set for us,\" Estrich said after she was named campaign manager in October. \"This will be a positive, issue-oriented campaign.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis did move past what Estrich had called a \"bump in a long road,\" and behind Estrich's organization, Dukakis triumphed in the New Hampshire and Minnesota primaries. On the eve of this week's Super Tuesday primaries across the South, polls predict Dukakis will finish among the leaders.</span></p> <p><span>\"[Estrich] commands a lot of respect,\" Akey says. \"She's done a terrific job here. Under Susan Estrich's leadership, Michael Dukakis' campaign has come a long way.\"</span></p> <p><span>Estrich made first made history when she became the first woman president of the Harvard Law Review in 1976. This year she stands alone again as the only woman campaign manager in the Democratic field.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think it's great that she's a trailblazer as a woman campaign manager, but I don't think it's really an issue as far as her performance is concerned,\" Akey says.</span></p> <p><span>If Dukakis does make it to the White House, colleagues speculate that the governor would likely offer her a high level position in the administration.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think if Dukakis won, she would surely end up in Washington as a very important advisor to him,\" Heymann says, \"If she had never run his campaign, she would have been likely to be an advisor for any of the democratic candidates. She must know Dukakis' constituency, his views, and what he feels strongly about better than almost anyone else. The sky's the limit.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Presenting Candidates to the People | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Anyone who follows national elections knows that there are two very different ways of interviewing a presidential hopeful. One way, exemplified by Kennedy School professor Marvin Kalb, is to involve the candidate in a substantial discussion of his future policy, the ways he reasons around an issue. The other, more provocative approach is to hurl incessant tough questions and see whether a potential leader can stand the heat.</span></p> <p><span>\"Candidates '88\" was Kalb's attempt to present his style to Americans through one-hour interviews. And in his interviews, it is fair to say that viewers got true League of Women Voters material.</span></p> <p><span>\"It was very difficult for the American people to get a handle on each one of these candidates,\" says Kalb. \"I thought it would be helpful...to see each one of the candidates in a serious setting...being asked serious questions.\"</span></p> <p><span>Despite having interviewed all but one of the presidential aspirants, Kalb insists that he is no political pundit, preferring to cast himself in more objective roles. \"For 37 years I was a reporter, and I'm now a professor...nothing sexy there,\" he states simply, as if his PBS shows were just another lecture series.</span></p> <p><span>It is true that Kalb, a former CBS and NBC diplomatic correspondent, has found a less visible role for himself at Harvard--indeed, his arrival at the Kennedy School last year coincided with his removal from <i>Who's Who in America</i>. Despite this fall from grace, Kalb has established himself as an oft-quoted and--pundit or not--an influential figure in the campaign which reaches Massachusetts tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to his post as Murrow Professor of Press and Public Policy, Kalb heads the K-School's fledgling Shorenstein-Barone Center for Press, Politics, and Public Policy. It was through the center that he launched \"Candidates '88,\" featuring 12 of the 13 presidential hopefuls for rounds of serious questioning.</span></p> <p><span>Serious questions, however, are no guarantee of serious answers. And even an unprecedented full-hour format does not ensure that candidates will deal with the issues, and not launch into tired campaign rhetoric. Kalb concedes that Sen. Al Gore Jr. '69 (D-Tenn.), for one, used the show more to present his image than to discuss policy. \"Each one of them came up here to look the best he could, to sound the best he could,\" says Kalb. \"A politician running for the presidency who did not take advantage of an hour of free time would be a fool.\"</span></p> <p><span>Even faced with this dilemma, this tendency towards soapbox sermonizing, Kalb's tendency is not to press harder, or put a candidate on the spot. This is largely due to the way he views his role as interviewer. The K-School professor is perhaps one of the last journalists to follow the example of Edward R. Murrow himself, emphasizing straightforward questioning while avoiding less friendly, if sometimes more effective, tactics.</span></p> <p><span>\"I never intended to trip anyone up,\" says Kalb. \"I don't want to do that, it's not my style...I don't think you get information out when you try to trip up a candidate.\" He says his show \"never was conceived of as an opportunity for me to engage in self-promoting, hyperbolic questions designed for the viewer to say \"Wow, isn't Marvin smart.' \" Kalb insists on deriding such hostile cross-examination as a diversion from any serious discussion of political issues.</span></p> <p><span>While Kalb exemplifies the laid-back, more intellectual approach, the more provocative method can be found in David Frost's program \"The Next President.\" Frost, who also interviewed a dozen would-be presidents in hour-long installments, made every effort to catch his guests off guard. Frost asked the Rev. Pat Robertson to explain what it was like to speak in tongues, and relentlessly questioned Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.) about contradictions in his views on abortion.</span></p> <p><span>Kalb, who says he saw three of Frost's interviews, balks at the slightest comparison between the two shows. \"I don't think there was anything similar at all except that they were both within an hour context and they were both on television,\" he says. \"If [the three I saw] were representative of the other nine, they were soft, <i>People</i> magazine, substanceless fluff,\" says Kalb. Moreover, Kalb points out that despite Frost's higher budget and more explosive style, \"Candidates '88\" received more coverage in the media. Clearly, even an academic likes to keep track of his headlines.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the candidates' inevitable image flaunting, Kalb says that, based on his expectation, he was impressed by many of those who appeared on his show. He cites the Rev. Jesse Jackson's \"growth as a political figure\" and Gov. Michael Dukakis' \"intellectual capacity.\" Kalb also extends praise to Pete DuPont, now out of the race, and Rep. Richard Gephardt (D.Mo.).</span></p> <p><span>On the other hand, Kalb says he was \"disappointed\" with Al Haig's interview. \"I know he is much smarter than he came through,\" says Kalb, \"and I was surprised that he did not take better advantage of the occasion than he did.\" He expresses similar disappointment with Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) for \"his overly simplistic presentation of very complicated ideas, particularly the manner in which he said he was going to balance the budget in three years.\"</span></p> <p><span>What of the one candidate who chose not to appear on \"Candidates '88\"--Vice-President George Bush? \"Well, it gave us a lot of free publicity,\" Kalb says matter-of-factly. Bush's decision also opened up a spot on the show--which was conveniently filled by former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart after his reemergence in the campaign. Kalb calls such a programming break \"pure serendipity.\"</span></p> <p><span>Super Tuesday provides an excellent case study for the Shorenstein-Barone Center, an interesting test of how a media strategy can boost candidates' chances and influence a campaign. Tomorrow's election will be the first major presidential contest since the center was established.</span></p> <p><span>Kalb says he expects the contest to disappoint Southern Democratic leaders, who structured the 20 simultaneous primaries in 1984 to improve the chances of party centrists for the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Because the Democrats allowed Super Tuesday to include border states and states like Massachusetts, Maryland, Washington, and Rhode Island, says Kalb, a clear assessment of the importance of the South as a voting bloc will not result.</span></p> <p><span>Kalb says further that Gore may not get the strong campaign push he hopes for from his fellow Southerners. \"If the polls are correct, either a candidate named 'undecided,' or a candidate named Dukakis, or a third candidate named Jackson may end up with all of the marbles, and not Gore,\" he says. \"The strategy, even from the point of view of a Southern moderate Democrat, may backfire.\"</span></p> <p><span>The K-School professor does believe, however, that the Democrats have a shot at the national contest in November. This depends on many factors, particularly the Republicans' choice of a nominee. \"If it's Bush, I'll hold by my prediction. the Democrats can win,\" says Kalb of the wayward Vice President.</span></p> <p><span>Three other important factors, he says, are the state of the economy, the choice of the Democratic running mate, and the pending results of the Iran-Contra investigation, which will have \"consequences that are almost inevitably going to be negative for the Republican Party.\"</span></p> <p><span>Amid persistent charges that the Democraticcontenders lack clear messages and identities inthis campaign, Kalb's assessment is that theDemocrats have generally done as well as theRepublicans in the use of paid media. He does, ofcourse, single out certain candidates from bothparties whom he says have done better thanaverage.</span></p> <p><span>\"Gephardt has done superbly well in the use ofnegative-sounding paid ads on television,\" saysKalb. \"It certainly paid off for him in Iowa andSouth Dakota... I think in the South it's going tobe more dispersed and diffuse so that you're notgoing to get a clear, hard focus on the relativevalue of some of these negative ads.\" He adds thatGephardt may not have sufficient funds to achievea similar success tomorrow, while Dukakis and Goredo have enough money.</span></p> <p><span>As for Jackson, who is expected to have astrong showing in the South tomorrow, Kalbreiterates that he is impressed with thecandidate's \"powers of articulation\" and \"growth,\"as well as his ability to attract white votes inprimarily white states \"by the power of hismessage.\"</span></p> <p><span>The candidate who seems to have gone thefarthest through the use of money and media--theRev. Pat Robertson--receives little praise fromKalb. \"Since New Hampshire, Robertson hasconducted one of the most painful and patheticpolitical campaigns that I've seen in a longtime,\" says Kalb, citing Robertson's accusationsagainst the Bush campaign among other issues.\"This man has demonstrated a capacity forpolitical suicide that surprises me because [he]was one of the most effective performers [on`Candidates '88'].\"</span></p> <p><span>Having established \"Candidates '88\" as aninfluential program, Kalb muses about the futureof his TV brainchild. \"I would love to be able in'92 to do a series called \"Candidates '92,\" hesays. \"And on the basis of the reaction of the PBSnetwork, and the reaction of most of the peoplewho have written about the series, I think that itwill be realistic and that it will happen.\"</span></p> <p><span>The former CBS and NBC correspondent ispessimistic, however, about the chances ofbringing a show like \"Candidates '88\" to a wideraudience through one of the major networks. \"Theopportunities for serious, substantive journalismon the three major commercial networks today arelimited, severely limited,\" he says, and adds thatthis is a major reason why he left networktelevision.</span></p> <p><span>In the meantime, Kalb says he \"wouldn't besurprised\" if, after this summer's conventions,PBS were to run a four-week series of interviewswith each of the presidential andvice-presidential nominees. Whether or not Americaviews this media expert as a bona fide pundit,that may be enough to catapult him back into theranks of <i>Who's Who.</i> And as any amateurpolitician can tell you, a public televisionaudience isn't NBC, but it's certainly better thana half-filled lecture hall</span></p>"}

We're out nailing down the last few votes for our massive victory that we project now on Tuesday. If you leave your name and number, we'll call you just as soon as we get back, but we're really busy now.\"</span></p> <p><span>Thus jested the answering machine at former Sen. Gary Hart's Boston headquarters, one of several Massachusetts campaign offices that was less than bustling on the weekend before Super Tuesday. This is the Duke's state, and most candidates seem willing to let the Duke have his day.</span></p> <p><span>So while Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis put the finishing touches on his Southern campaign this weekend, most of his rivals for the Democratic nomination chose to cut their losses by avoiding the popular governor's own state.</span></p> <p><span>Massachusetts is especially risky ground for Democratic intruders because state primary rules allot delegates to candidates only if they win 15 percent or more of the vote. Those who fail to meet that threshold will have nothing to show for whatever effort they invest in the state. And local Democrats say the governor's lead is prohibitive, leaving them with little to do, and rivals with little hope.</span></p> <p><span>For once in a Massachusetts primary, the underdog Republicans can claim that the real battle is in their party. Democratic primaries often decide elections in this state. But this time the Democratic contest is all but over, while Vice President George Bush and Sen. Robert Dole (R.-Kan.) are competing relatively hard for delegates here.</span></p> <p><span>Nancy Carter, a staff member of the GOP State Committee, says she expects a large turn-out from Independents as well as Republicans. \"You have to watch out for Independents because many of them think our way but they want their independent status.\" She predicts a victory for Bush, saying that of all the Republicans, he has put the most money and personal appearances into the state.</span></p> <p><span>But Dole field director Steve Silveira claims the best Republican organization in the state. \"The other campaigns have not been visibly active,\" he says. \"I don't know anybody who's received literature or been called by another campaign.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"People will be doing the live signage at choke points around the state,\" says Dole staffer Rick Stanco. In translation, that means that bunches of half a dozen Dole supporters are scheduled to display the candidate's placards along crowded highways like Routes 128 and 93.</span></p> <p><span>Stanco, who directs the student campaign effort, claimed campus organizations with a \"diverse\" membership of nearly 600. But Stanco added that diversity means a healthy variety of moderates.</span></p> <p><span>Silveira says he is counting on many Independents and even Democrats to vote for Dole in the primary.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's two schools of thought\" among Massachusetts voters, he adds. \"One is that it's a complete waste of time to vote with the Democrats... The other line of thinking is, \"Let's go out for the hometown boy and give him a big vote.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, he calls the Republican primary \"the only real race in town.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis' last major campaign appearance in Massachusetts was last Tuesday, when he swung through North Cambridge and other parts of the solidly Democratic Eighth Congressional District. Since then, the governor has been airborne, stopping in the Super Tuesday states of Texas, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Maryland, and even touring the West Coast.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Duke's been low-keying it,\" says Harlan Jones, a member of the Jackson campaign staff. Cambridge City Councillors reached over the weekend verified his comment. Several said they were mostly occupied with their own campaigns for membership on the city ward committees, which will also be chosen tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm supporting President... um...Governor Dukakis,\" says Councillor Sheila Russell of North Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span>Russell joined Dukakis--and most of her Council colleagues--during a campaign stop at a North Cambridge nursing home on Tuesday. But she planned to spend Saturday night at a Boy Scouts' testimonial dinner, not on the campaign trail.</span></p> <p><span>Russell adds that if New York Gov. Mario Cuomo chooses to endorse Dukakis, as has been rumored, Dukakis could pick up even stronger support from Italian communities like the neighborhood along Cambridge St. \"He'll have East Cambridge unless Lee Iacocca comes into it,\" she says.</span></p> <p><span>\"I just did a little bit down Scituate way,\" says former Mayor Walter J. Sullivan Jr., who owns a summer home in the South Shore town. \"I did my share in Cambridge,\" he adds. \"We did the rest homes all during the week.\"</span></p> <p><span>Sullivan says he sees \"a lot of Republicans out there\" campaigning, but very few members of his own party. \"I can't believe it,\" he says. Tuesday, he adds, he'll be \"just going around trying to bring people to the polls\"--adding that the effort could be difficult because Cantabrigians vote sparsely in primaries.</span></p> <p><span>The Rev. Jesse Jackson's campaign chose to make a strong effort in Massachusetts, and was scheduled to receive the endorsement of civil rights leader Julian Bond today. Jones says the campaign had concentrated on distributing leaf-lets in predominantly Black Boston neighborhoods and outside Black churches on Sunday morning.</span></p> <p><span>He says tomorrow the campaign will put \"every person we have\" into making sure that Jackson's voters make it to the polls.</span></p> <p><span>The campaign's expectations from Massachusetts voters are low, at least officially. \"We're saying 5 percent, but we think we can do better,\" Jones says of the voter totals. \"Anything over that is a victory.\" But don't think the Jackson campaign has forgotten about the 15 percent threshold.</span></p> <p><span>As for Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt's campaigning, \"We're not,\" says Jane Arnold '90, who directs a small volunteer corps--\"three very dedicated men, basically.\" Arnold is the candidate's only official staff member in this state.</span></p> <p><span>\"We're hitting some plant gates and some retirement homes,\" Arnold says. \"Those are our natural constituency in this state.\"</span></p> <p><span>Arnold says of Jackson's choice to campaign here, \"He's doing very well. It's a strategy that might have worked for us.\" She says a second candidate could pick up a protest vote against Dukakis. \"Those who haven't benefited from the Massachusetts Miracle--quote, unquote--will be looking for an alternative,\" she says.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Duke and His Castle? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic Party frontrunner in delegates and funding, may be on his way to the White House.</span></p> <p><span>But the national press has all but forgotten that the three-term governor once faced tougher times. In 1978 he failed in his re-election bid against conservative Edward J. King. Seen as arrogant and too friendly to powerful business interests, Dukakis lost support to King on the right and to former Cambridge Mayor Barbara Ackerman on the left.</span></p> <p><span>Like many another wounded politician, he found an academic haven in Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, where he served as a lecturer and director of intergovernmental studies beginning in mid-1980.</span></p> <p><span>But like very few others, he left that haven two-and-a-half years later to win back his office, and eventually to become the top candidate for the nation's highest post.</span></p> <p><span>How much credit can the K-School take for the comeback?</span></p> <p><span>Some Massachusetts pundits describe Dukakis' term in Harvard Square as a fruitful apprenticeship to some of the nation's top political minds. They also say he owes much of his more recent success to support and advice from his former colleagues there.</span></p> <p><span>But many professors, analysts, and campaign staffers back up the governor's claim to the dogged virtues of the marathon runner he once was. They argue that he learned at least as much from private reflection as he did from the sages of JFK Street.</span></p> <p><span>In his stint at the Kennedy School, Dukakis helped to create a training program for state and local officials, taught courses on management in government, conducted research comparing chief executives on national, state, and local levels, and was a guest moderator of \"The Advocates,\" a national public television series.</span></p> <p><span>When Dukakis left the Kennedy School in 1982 to return to the State House he took with him eight staff and faculty members, including Associate Dean Ira Jackson, who became his Comissioner of Revenue and Nicholas Mitropoulos, who works on the governor's presidential campaign as a special assistant.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy School Dean Graham T. Allison '62 reportedly negotiated a limit with Dukakis on the number of faculty members he could take with him, Kennedy School officials say.</span></p> <p><span>Further, they say Dukakis does not have strong ties to Kennedy School faculty, and that he does not seek their advice more often than other presidential candidates consult academics.</span></p> <p><span>Many professors who knew the governor as a colleague from 1979 to 1982 say he used the time away from active politics primarily to reflect about his past.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Kennedy School gave him an opportunity to think about governance, to think through some of the success he had had and mistakes he had made,\" said Robert B. Reich, a lecturer on public policy.</span></p> <p><span>\"He didn't come here and sit at our feet and learn about public policy,\" said Herman B. Leonard, Baker professor of public managment. \"He came here to reflect.\"</span></p> <p><span>But several faculty members added that Dukakis' stay at the Kennedy School taught him to temper his arrogance and work better with others. This, they suggest, may be the key to the Dukakis transformation.</span></p> <p><span>\"There probably wasn't much of a change in [Dukakis'] substantive knowledge,\" said Ronald F. Ferguson, assistant professor of public policy. \"If you look at his political style, you will see more of a responsiveness in people's perceptions other than his.\"</span></p> <p><span>Olivia A. Golden '76, a lecturer in public policy, said Dukakis learned \"coalition building\" during his Kennedy School years.</span></p> <p><span>But other faculty caution that it would be difficult to trace which new traits Dukakis could have picked up at the Kennedy School.</span></p> <p><span>As governor, Dukakis has received advice from a number of faculty members, including Professor of Government Joseph S. Nye, who worked with him on foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span>Academic Dean Albert Carnesale said Dukakis asked him for his views on the implications of the Chernobyl accident and their bearing on the Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire. And Leonard directed Dukakis' task force on assisting families and students to deal with tuition increases, while Reich has advised on economic policy.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the professors whom Dukakis has consulted say they are not officially advising him on his presidential campaign. But a few say they continue advise Dukakis staffers from time to time.</span></p> <p><span>\"The notion that the Kennedy School is Dukakis' brain trust is largely mythical,\" said Reich. \"There are just a few of us advising him. It is a gross exaggeration to say the Kennedy School is largely and wholly involved on his campaign.\"</span></p> <p><span>Even political analyists downplay the Dukakis-Kennedy School connection. Janet Smith, a political consultant with the Boston firm, Martilla and Kiley, which advised the campaign of Sen. Joseph R. Biden (D.-Del.) until his withdrawal, said Biden's staff never considered the governor's bond to the school unusual or worth turning into a campaign issue.</span></p> <p><span>And a staffer on the Gephardt campaign said he did not consider Dukakis' K-School connections significant either. \"There's no monopoly on political advice,\" he said. \"Gephardt has his own prominent scholars giving him advice.\"</span></p> <p><span>Amid early predictions of a Dukakis victory in November, professors discounted predictions that the governor would bring a cast of faculty with him to Washington.</span></p> <p><span>\"Just for political reasons, he would not want to take too many people from one place,\" Carnesale said. \"I'd be surprised if it were a large number.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nye said a large Kennedy School contingent probably would not arrive in Washington, considering Dukakis' chances of victory, then of his choosing people from the Kennedy School, and then of those people accepting the offer.</span></p> <p><span>\"Of the people Dukakis could ask,\" Ferguson said, \"not many would even want to go.\" want to go.\"</span></p> <p><span>Though most professors refused to speculate on Dukakis' choices should he be elected President, one tenured professor guessed that Dukakis might tap the expertise of Nye, Allison, Professor of Economics Jeffrey Sachs, or Boas Professor of International Economics Richard N. Cooper.</span></p>"}

A Southern-style barn-burner, or at least that's what Gary Trudeau would have us believe.</span></p> <p><span>The prize in this mythic Southern battle--a whopping 2000 plus delegates and a chance to lock up the Democratic and Republican nominations. And beyond that a chance for the South to rise again. Said to say, none of this will happen.</span></p> <p><span>When 20 states--including 14 Southern and border states--go to the polls Tuesday, thousands of Americans will take a part in an experiment in regional power politics. From Washington state to Birmingham, Alabama and Key West, Florida, candidates must disseminate their messages, carefully targeted to appeal to this predominantly Southern audience. But the experiment has gone awry.</span></p> <p><span>No candidate can campaign effectively in all 20 states, and, no presidential hopeful can personally offer a political vision that appeals to voters in the Northwest and the Southeast, from Missouri to Miami. Only through television advertising and shrewd political marketing can the candidates hope to \"win\" Super Tuesday, the headlined event of this primary season.</span></p> <p><span>Super Tuesday's claim to Southern supremacy rested on the assumption that there would be a Southern candidate to lead the charge. But Sarr Nunn balked at the opportunity, and so did former Virginia Governor Charles Robb. That left Albert Gore '69, Harvard overseer, prep-school graduate to carry the mantle. But the Eastern-educated senator has had his troubles convincing voters that he's a good ole' boy who was brought up on a pig farm in Tennessee.</span></p> <p><span>Gore, like much of the Southern political establishment, has banked his political future on Super Tuesday. He essentially withdrew from the races in New Hampshire and Iowa, concentrating his resources and stump time on the South. But Gore's strategy, like that of his region's, will likely be unsuccessful. In the weeks since New Hampshire, other candidates, too, have focused their attention on the South to the exclusion of the other eight states that hold primaries on Super Tuesday. And those efforts should be most beneficial to a liberal from Massachusetts, and a black activist based in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span>But in the end, the biggest winner of all may prove to be what are known as wholesale politics. The biggest loser--the personal politics that held sway in Iowa and New Hampshire, where candidates often criscrossed the same small towns. Super Tuesday, as Robin Toner of the New York Times notes, is as much \"the K-2 campaign\" as the people's forum. K-2 is the satellite that makes it possible for Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D.Mo.) to answer questions from North Carolina and Wyoming from a hotel suite in Kansas City.</span></p> <p><span>The Gore political message is an important one in understanding the symbolism of Super Tuesday. Gore's stump speech and his television advertisements proclaim his Southern heritage, his hawkish stance on national defense and his willingness to talk tough in a field of Democratic candidates that won't.</span></p> <p><span>These issues, carefully designed to appeal to the conservative white voter in the South, are planned obfuscations of Gore's liberal past. His Congressional voting record is not significantly more conservative than the other presidential candidates; in fact, Gore's rating from the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action places him at the left end of the Democratic spectrum.</span></p> <p><span>Political revisionism is hardly a phenomenon unique to the Gore campaign--Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) is an experienced practitioner of the art of the flip-flop, changing his stance on such key issues as supply-side economics and abortion. But Gore is a specifically Southern revisionist--his campaign message is tailored, like the Super Tuesday system itself, to attract a certain type of Southern voter. But the suit has proved ill-fitting.</span></p> <p><span>A recent New York Times survey points to some of the flaws in tailor-making a platform to the regional voter's profile. The poll found that Democratic voters who support Gore were not substantially more \"hawkish\" on security issues, that Gephardt supporters were not more likely to blame Japan for the U.S.'s trade woes and that Dukakis backers were not most worried about a war in Central America.</span></p> <p><span>Bush supporters were not much more pro-Reagan than Bob Dole's, and Dole's weren't more enticed by compromise with the Democrats than Bush's.</span></p> <p><span>Those issues, of course, are what the candidates have converted into their personal crusades, yet they don't seem to be convincing the voters. As E.J. Dionne wrote, the poll \"produced other fascinating anomalies that suggest how little the candidate's views have penetrated with voters in the vast region that will vote next Tuesday.\"</span></p> <p><span>If Dionne's analysis is correct, then the marketing of Super Tuesday as the great Southern primary is overstated. The great television primary will prove to be a better tag.</span></p>"}

The ceremony is regularly broadcast across the South on a Spanish-language radio network.</span></p> <p><span>In a press conference afterward, Dukakis said Hispanic voters need jobs and affordable housing, not training in English, to survive economically.</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't know anything more inspiring than full employment,\" Dukakis said. \"English is the language of this country. It doesn't have to be the official language. I don't buy that. We grow from the diversity of this country.\"</span></p> <p><span>The morning of campaigning in south Texas kicked off a day-long trek across the South scheduled to conclude in Plains, Ga., with a meeting with former President Jimmy Carter and his wife Roslyn.</span></p> <p><span>The governor's San Antonio appearance came on the anniversary of Santa Anna's defeat of about 189 Alamo defenders, which included some Mexican-Americans.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis' Texas Campaign Director Thomas Cosgrove said Dukakis scheduled the cathedral appearance before plans for the Alamo anniversary were in full swing.</span></p> <p><span>But remembering the Alamo might have been political dynamite for a candidate depending on Hispanic voters to maintain his lead in the two days remaining before Super Tuesday primaries here and across the South. Dukakis has featured ads in Spanish as well as English.</span></p> <p><span>The Alamo has been a controversial topic among Hispanics because a recent film made to commemorate the event downplayed the role of Spanish-Americans in defending the fort from the Mexican army. Protesters were expected to attend a rally at the Alamo yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>The Dukakis campaign has spent some $300,000 in Texas, according to Cosgrove, and he said he expected the figure to top $500,000 by Super Tuesday. The governor's spending as of December exceeded his opponents' by more than five to one.</span></p> <p><span>\"Our big advantage is we've been here since October and we have a grass-roots organization,\" said Lorraine Voles, a Dukakis campaign staffer.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis has some 40 full-time paid staffers working in Texas and an estimated 2000 volunteers across the state, whose 183 Democratic delegates is the largest of the 19 Super Tuesday states and American Samoa.</span></p> <p><span>Despite an absence of top-name endorsements in Texas, the latest poll conducted by two Texas newspapers showed Dukakis leading with 30 percent, Jesse Jackson in second with 17 percent, Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt with 13 percent, Tennessee Sen. Albert J. Gore Jr. '69 with 10 percent and undecided voters at 25 percent. Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon trailed in the single numbers.</span></p> <p><span>\"The race is still very fluid,\" said Voles, referring to the undecided vote.</span></p> <p><span>A number of Hispanic leaders joined Dukakis in campaigning. They walked through the streets of San Antonio, took a trolley ride and attended a midday rally.</span></p> <p><span>San Antonio City Councilor Maria Berriozabal, who has endorsed Dukakis, said it wasn't so much his ability to speak Spanish that helped the governor but his views about economic opportunity.</span></p> <p><span>\"We have actually seen his track record in Massachusetts,\" Berriozabal said. \"We have the resources and the people to solve our own problems, but we need a leader.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Al Gore | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N the last two decades, the Democrats have won a single presidential election. If they fail to nominate Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore '69 they will most likely continue their losing streak.</span></p> <p><span>Let's face it. Gore is the most electable of all the Democratic candidates and the one whom Republicans fear the most. Furthermore, Gore is the one candidate who stands squarely in the Democratic Party's proud tradition of international leadership, economic growth, and social justice. He promises a return to the pragmatism and hard-nosed leadership that characterized the Democratic Party of Franklin D. Roosevelt '04, Harry S. Truman, and John F. Kennedy '40.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>FTER the Reagan Administration, this nation needs a leader comfortable and expert with foreign affairs. Gore's experience and expertise here outshadows those of his rivals. Considered one of the Senate's leading experts on arms control, Gore, along with other moderate Democrats, successfully has prodded the Administration towards a real arms control policy--finally culminating in the INF treaty. Alone among the Democratic candidates, Gore supports humanitarian assistance to the Nicaraguan contras as a way to honor the Arias Peace Plan and ensure Sandinista good intentions.</span></p> <p><span>Gore has supported the Administration's successful policy of reflagging Kuwaiti tankers, which has kept the sea lanes open, protected a vital U.S. strategic interest, and stymied Iran's expansionist policy. Only now are the other Democratic candidates belatedly beginning to endorse this policy. While opposing development and deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), Gore supports limited research in order to keep the U.S. prepared in case the Soviets develop a similar system. Although these views may not be endorsed by Jesse Helms or Jesse Jackson, they represent a judicious, pragmatic foreign policy, one which does not wear ideological blinders.</span></p> <p><span><b>G</b>ORE brings his Congressional experience and level-headed pragmatism to domestic issues as well. With the departure of Gov. Bruce Babbitt from the race, Gore is now the only candidate in either party with a credible budget plan, one that seeks to hammer out a new consensus on fiscal policy. Unlike Reagan, who scuttled budget talks by refusing to raise taxes or cut defense expenditures, Gore would put almost everything on the table. That's not to say, however, that Gore wouldn't have his own list of priorities: he'll cut spending where it doesn't endanger national security or cut essential services. On the revenue side, Gore would work to close remaining tax loopholes, ensure better tax compliance, and support better tax compliance, and support new taxes as long as they are progressive and proinvestment.</span></p> <p><span>Compare that with the more simplistic and unrealistic proposals his rivals have offered so far. While Senator Paul Simon promises us that \"the figures are there\" to support his claims for both a massive spending program and a balanced budget, the numbers show otherwise. Gov. Michael Dukakis's budget plan, which consists of collecting unpaid taxes and saying that \"tough choices have to be made,\" fails to make any decisions on taxes and spending. Jesse Jackson's plan to reduce the deficit by making very deep cuts in defense spending may balance the budget, but only by drastically weakening this nation's national security. And any self-respecting Democrat should ignore whatever Congressman Richard Gephardt has to say on the budget deficit, since he supported the Administration's disastrous 1981 tax cut which helped to create it.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE recent electoral record makes it clear that Democratic candidates who fare badly in the South cannot expect to win in November. And with the possible exception of Gephardt--a \"pandering populist\" whose flip-flops on a number of important issues and support for protectionist trade legislation reveals him as the cynical political opportunist he is--Gore is the only Democratic candidate capable of succeeding in the South Vice President George Bush or Sen. Robert Dole.</span></p> <p><span>However, even though Gore is the Democratic candidate most likely to win votes in the South, he is far from being a racist, conservative good ol' boy. Like his father--former Senator Albert Gore, Sr., who, alone among all Southern senators, refused to sign the \"Southern Manifesto\" attacking \"Brown v. Board of Education\"--Gore has been a strong supporter of civil rights legislation and has vehemently criticized recent Administration attempts to gut the Voting Rights Act and affirmative action. Indeed, after Jackson, Gore is the top choice of several major civil rights groups. Gore has also sponsored and supported legislation to increase federal aid to the homeless, helped create the Environmental Protection Agency Superfund, and has attacked the Administration's attempts to slash student aid for higher education.</span></p> <p><span>Critics will point to Gore's youth and to his \"patrician background\" as making him unfit to be president. Yet \"patrician backgrounds\" hardly affected the ability of FDR and JFK to govern on behalf of the less fortunate members of our society. Those who bring up Gore's age do so simply because they have nothing more substantial to raise against him, since, at 39, he already possesses 11 years of Congressional experience and a substantive legislative record.</span></p> <p><span>Gore is a talented campaigner and a highly formidable debater who would give the Republicans fits in the general election precisely because he can't be pigeonholed as \"soft\" on communism or as a big spender. While remaining loyal to the Democratic Party's liberal traditions, Gore would be able to bring moderate voters back into its fold, and thereby propel it back into the White House.</span></p>"}

Dukakis is the only Democrat in the race who has a proven track record of success, and he has also demonstrated the personal qualities of honesty, candor, and integrity that set him apart from his competitors.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis is the only candidate who has <i>run</i> a government. Sen. Paul Simon, Rep. Richard Gephardt, and Sen. Albert Gore '69 have built their careers on Capitol Hill, while Jesse Jackson has never held elected office. Dukakis is the only one who has balanced a budget, formulated a legislative program, led a cabinet, and acted as an executive. He has learned the need for compromise and agreement, which will serve him well in Washington. He has drawn his experience from the act of governing, not sitting in a comfortable Washington office building worrying about PACs and interest groups.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis' record as governor of Massachusetts illustrates a record of tangible achievement, rather than the theoretical--and at times fanciful--plans of his competitors. Fiscal prudence and compassionate, practical social programs have become the Dukakis trademark. Massachusetts has led the nation in its workfare programs, its housing and education initiatives, and in its insurance and health legislation.</span></p> <p><span>And the governor is the only candidate who can make good on his promises for economic success. Under the Dukakis administration, the state became known as the \"Massachusetts miracle\" for its booming economic growth--employment hovers around 2 percent, three points below the national average. Dukakis has implemented policies which have fostered innovation and growth, while he has personally encouraged the partnerships between industry, government, and universities that have made Massachusetts one of the nation's high-tech, export centers. Dukakis can rightfully claim some credit for transforming a state once called \"Taxachusetts\"--beset with high unemployment, crime, and a declining economy--into the nation's top economic success.</span></p> <p><span><b>U</b>NLIKE Reagan, Dukakis' management style displays a \"hands-on\" philosophy. The recent shake-ups in the Dukakis campaign hierarchy, in which Dukakis fired two of his most trusted advisors for unethical practices, show that for him, the ends do not justify the means. This is a refreshing and attractive attitude after eight years of the most scandal-ridden administration in history, presided over by a man who neither knows nor cares what his subordinates do in his name.</span></p> <p><span>But Dukakis is not only running as governor of Massachusetts, but as a man who can apply his knowledge and expertise to national problems--such as trade, foreign affairs, and the environment. Dukakis rightly places himself against Gephardt's call for sweeping protectionist legislation and instead calls for national attention on rehabilitating our weaker industries. Dukakis considers the best policies to be limited protection of only the most hard-hit industries--such as oil and textiles--only so long as to allow them time to catch up with existing technologies.</span></p> <p><span>The governor's vision comes through in his plan for a national energy program, which would help reduce our dependence on foreign energy production. This includes tax breaks for Texas oil producers and development of alternate energy supplies. This would decrease our dependence on nuclear energy, which Dukakis has fought in his battle against the Seabrook nuclear plant.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis has moved to develop a coherent foreign policy, one that recognizes that America can no longer dictate to the rest of the world. President Dukakis would use both negotiation and a newly-revamped and efficient military to live in a multipolar, not a bipolar, world. Perhaps what we need now is a president who can bring intelligence and good sense to foreign policy, not a strict ideology as a \"hawk\" or a \"dove.\" Dukakis would be an \"owl.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>D</b>UKAKIS has proved himself a \"man of the people.\" He rides to the office on the T and he buys his suits from Filene's basement. Dukakis, in fact, has better proven himself to be \"one of us\" in the South than has Gore, whose Washington upbringing, prep school/Harvard ties and liberal voting record are taken as evidence that he has betrayed the South.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis has an excellent reputation for honesty and straight-forwardness, qualities which have deflected much of the moral criticism that has plagued the other candidates. America's love for these virtues, which Reagan captialized on in his campaigns, shows the importance they hold for voters.</span></p> <p><span>On many issues Dukakis shows fundamental disagreement with other candidates and he emerges with more of a discernable identity than others. He repudiates Gore's militaristic foreign policy, Simon's ludicrous public works-balanced budget proposals, and Jackson's unfeasible visions.</span></p> <p><span>Michael Dukakis is the man among all the presidential contenders who has consistently shown his desire to address the needs of all Americans. His record has not favored the rich or the poor, but has treated all fairly with an aim toward social justice and sensitivity from the government. His record as a chief executive and his inherent integrity show that he is the man who can succeed in this effort. We support him for the Democratic Presidential nomination.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Paul Simon | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>The Crimson</i> staff considered endorsements for the presidential candidates who had backers on staff. None of the candidates garnered majority support, so all five endorsements will be run in the order of the amount of support that they received.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T'S too good to be true, and therefore the Simon Administration probably won't be.</span></p> <p><span>At every stage in his presidential bid, Sen. Paul Simon (D-III.) has run counter to conventional political wisdom, and, sad to say, such \"wisdom\" may actually carry the day on Super Tuesday and the rest of the primaries that will follow.</span></p> <p><span>Simon has been slow to adopt the maxims his chief opponents have deployed so effectively with voters in New Hampshire and lowa: cardinal rules like, \"don't tell people you will raise their taxes even if it is for the nation's good,\" \"say you'll protect American products, even though you know it will lead to a trade war,\" and most importantly, \"don't get too emotional about America's shortcomings because no one wants to here it, anyway.\" The couched language and disingenuous strategizing of Simon's prime foes, Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, may be politically smart, but they certainly aren't wise for the country. And Paul Simon won't do it.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, political scientists may someday look back at this presidential race, and be able to chart the conquest of image over the American political system. Not the infiltration of medial politics, for Ronald Reagan was nothing, if not a media candidate. But its grand perfection. For in 1988 we have a political contest in which every candidate, from party hack to civil rights leader to ethnic technocrat, conforms to a well-thought-out media plan. Where a 39-year-old, wet-behind-the-ears legislator like Sen. Albert Gore '69 (D-Tenn) is pushed into the presidential race by the results of a poll which shows that voters surveyed think he most lools like The Commander-in-Chief.</span></p> <p><span>Cynics might sneer and say that Simon himself is a media creation--that his sheer abhorrence of political pandering and gregarious glad-handing belies an image-conscious campaign in its own right. And doesn't that fact say a lot about the state of American politics today.</span></p> <p><span>For the dismissal of Simon as just another image from a media consultant's blueprint is perhaps the most stupid failure of the so-called \"genius of American politics.\" It seems that when commentators talk about Simon they can't see his large programs for his bowtie. That commentators shallowly label Simon's call for a caring government a press-office creation after eight years of Reaganomics is shocking. If we ever are going to end homelessness and racism and a thousand other social ills, we are going to have to refute that super-savvy sneerful kind of reasoning. Paul Simon is the man to do it.</span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>E is electable. Were it not for a few percentage points, Simon would be the \"other candidate,\" who could provide the populist opposition to the smugly meritocratic, technocratic, vaguely bureaucratic, candidacy of Dukakis. As it is now, Simon possesses the range of traditional Democratic party constituencies: ethnics, dumped-on farmers, the elderly, and the working classes.</span></p> <p><span>He is qualified. Simon has the most Congressional experience of any candidate running for the Democratic nomination. His conduct throughout the campaign has been issue-based and on the point.</span></p> <p><span>And his ideas are best for the country. Simon recognizes that America is fast becoming a land divided: with the affluent and educated on one side, and the destitute and the drop-out on the other. (Divisions that have been enhanced by the policies of the Reagan Administration.) That is why Simon, an author of 10 books and newspaper publisher at 19, has targeted his programs for the future on improving education and eliminating illiteracy. Compare that to his so-called liberal foe, Mike Dukakis, who has received poor grades from Massachusetts public educators for being stingy on public university funding.</span></p> <p><span>On civil rights, Simon has risen to prominence as a co-sponsor of the Civil Rights Act of 1984 and from his intelligent and principled questioning during the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Robert H. Bork. He began his outspoken defense of civil rights when it was least popular, in the 1950's in the Illinois state house.</span></p> <p><span>His foreign policy differs little from the Democratic contenders, except Gore, on the important questions, like a freeze on nuclear testing, and opposition to the illegal war in Nicaragua. And unlike the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Simon leaves no doubt about his support of Israel and the importance of a peace agreement in the region.</span></p> <p><span>And when it comes to government spending, Simon is not afraid to call for defense cuts and more social programs. His program is straight from another era, when government provided for all strata of citizenry. His one troubling position--in favor of a balanced budget amendment--is hardly motivated by the platitudinous and knee-jerk reasons given by the other candidates who favor the amendment. Correctly, Simon observes that unbalanced budgets raise interest rates and in that way facilitate one of the largest income transfers--from poor to rich--supported by the Reagan administration. Even if the legislation would curtail important flexibility in the budget-making process, his reasoning asks the right questions, questions whose class analysis is unparalleled in the current campaign.</span></p> <p><span>On farm policy, Simon offers a coherent aid plan, without giving away the store, as the winner in Iowa, Gephardt, had no trouble doing. And unlike Dukakis, Simon's plans for America extend past the Eastern shore, and its endive-garnished hors d'oeuvres.</span></p> <p><span>A Simon candidacy hopes to restore a long tradition of Democratic presidents, and doesn't manuever its way toward supposed new constituencies who want government out of their lives--whether on an abortion amendment, or large welfare programs. But if the support for Mario Cuomo in the polls--which is exclusively support for his \"caring government\" rhetoric--can be trusted, then maybe a Simon Administration is what Americans really want. That's an image America can be proud of.</span></p>"}

Paul Simon (D.-III.), who suffered a shutout in Super Tuesday's round of primaries and caucuses.</span></p> <p><span>Simon, who held just 35.5 delegates both before and after Tuesday's balloting, can only hope that nobody will have gained the 2082 delegates needed to win the Democratic presidential nomination. The primaries conclude on June 7, when California and New Jersey vote. The two states are among the largest, with a total of 423 delegates at stake.</span></p> <p><span><b>Magic Number</b></span></p> <p><span>\"The person or persons with the greatest potential to negotiate his way to a first-ballot victory will be the candidate who is hottest at the end,\" Michael said.</span></p> <p><span>The odds are growing longer that any candidate can come up with the magic number needed to win on the first ballot at the Democratic convention in Atlanta.</span></p> <p><span>The Democrats have yet to allocate 2524 of their national convention delegates, and another 258.65 delegates list themselves as uncommitted. Thus the available pool of delegates to be won between now and early June would be 2782.65.</span></p> <p><span>Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who was leading the field of Democratic candidates with 456.5 delegates, needs to win another 1625.5 delegates to wrap up the presidential nomionation. Or, put another way, he has to win more than 58 percent of all the delegates that are still left to be won--roughly twice as well as he's done so far.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis was followed in the delegate count by the Rev. Jesse Jackson with 395.55 and Sen. Albert Gore Gore, Jr. '69 (D.-Tenn.) with 346.8.</span></p> <p><span>The three-way tie in the Democratic race prompted former President Jimmy Carter to observe, \"I think it's accurate to say the chances are less likely that one of the candidates will arrive in Atlanta with a clear majority.\"</span></p> <p><span>Michael said if no candidate holds a majority by the time the primaries conclude, the rule of conscience that binds delegates to the candidates will begin to bend and break.</span></p> <p><span>However, Jude Barry, an aide to the presidential campaign of Rep. Richard Gephardt (D.-Mo.), disagreed, saying, \"I think there's going to be loyalty and commitment. We're prepared to protect what we have, as I'm sure the other candidates will as well.\"</span></p> <p><span>Gephardt, who had 143 delegates after Super Tuesday, is hoping to hang on with a strong showing in the Michigan caucuses on March 26 and the congressional Democratic caucuses on April 19 and 20. Gephardt is planning on winning big when his House colleagues pick 210 of their own to be national convention delegates. Another 43 delegates will be picked by Senate Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, Republican resistance to Vice President George Bush's bid for the White House began crumbling yesterday as the impact of his fabulous Super Tuesday showing sank in.</span></p> <p><span>Bush spent the day in Houston savoring his 16-state primary sweep and the roughly 600 delegates they brought. The outlook for Illinois wasn't bad either, as Gov. James Thompson was backing the vice president and Sen. Bob Dole (R.-Kan.)'s own campaign polls gave Bush the lead.</span></p> <p><span>The Vice President apparently tried to nudge Dole from the race. He declined his rival's challenge to debate him in Illinois with a telegram that said the time had come to \"look ahead to the issues which distinguish us from the Democrats.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Good luck,\" he wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Dole awoke to a campaign in shambles after losing all 17 Super Tuesday states and conceded, \"I've got to win Illinois\" to save his candidacy.</span></p> <p><span>Dole aside, the Vice President's rivals signaled they knew the game was all but over.</span></p> <p><span>\"None of us could have dreamed that [Bush] could be so strong,\" said Pat Robertson. He said the vice president had run a \"fabulous race,\" and added, \"The mantle of Ronald Reagan has passed to George Bush.\" The former television evangelist said he would remain in the race, but talked in terms of expanding his support for a campaign rerun in 1992.</span></p> <p><span>Rep.

{"title": "Afraid to Put Up His Duke-s | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>M</b>Y first memory of Mike Dukakis was during his declaration of a State of Emergency during the infamous Blizzard of '78. This brave, courageous leader came on television and cancelled school for a week. I was a fan from the start. Since then, Dukakis has done nothing but disappoint.</span></p> <p><span>A local political columnist sarcastically calls him \"Michael the Good.\" Many of his supporters refer to him as \"the Duke.\" If it weren't so shocking it would be almost funny--that this short, homely, boring, geek of a governor named Michael Stanley Dukakis is the front-runner for the Democratic Presidential nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Many students who haven't followed Dukakis throughout his political career probably regard him as a capable, well-respected man. They see him as a governor who has done a good job managing Massachusetts. Don't be fooled.</span></p> <p><span>I don't ask a lot of a candidate. He or she doesn't have to be the most telegenic, the most qualified, or the one with the most money or best organization. All I ask for is commitment and honesty. Despite his well-cultivated image, Mike Dukakis just doesn't measure up--he'll sell his soul to win the White House.</span></p> <p><span>One of the most glaring examples of Dukakis' opportunism and inconsistency is his uneven support of gay and lesbian rights. Throughout his first and most of his second term as governor, Dukakis was widely perceived as being a strong supporter of gay and lesbian issues. During his 1986 bid for reelection, however, the Boston Globe ran a story on two gay men who were foster parents to two young children. Legislative outcry and political pressure soon led Dukakis to formulate a plan making it virtually impossible for gays and lesbians in Massachusetts to be foster parents.</span></p> <p><span>During the 1987 legislative session a Gay Rights Bill--having passed the Massachusetts House--was stalled in a Senate committee and kept from the full body, which was expected to approve it. Although he threw quiet support behind the bill, Dukakis--who was campaigning in Iowa--refused to take an active roll in salvaging it and let it die in committee.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis has also waffled on AIDS. While the Governor can talk a great game about how educating people is fundamental to halting the spread of AIDS, he gets very squeamish when he realizes how brutally frank education about sexually transmitted diseases must be. Last year, the Massachusetts AIDS Action Committee printed a pamphlet for distribution in gay bars and bookstores. When the pamphlet came to the attention of the state legislature, Dukakis supported criticism of the pamphlet that complained of its explicitness. What Dukakis failed to comprehend is that the pamphlet--which made clear and detailed reference to several gay sex acts--was not meant for elderly women or junior high school students; it was carefully targeted for practicing homosexuals in order to halt the spread of the disease.</span></p> <p><span>Last month, Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn endorsed a proposal to experiment with a clean needle exchange program for intravenous drug addicts. Although the plan fails to address the question of drug abuse, it has proven very successful in Great Britain in combatting the spread of the disease. Dukakis balked at the plan, and--always a man with open mind--said he would refuse to support it, even if it proved successful in Boston. Apparently, the governor is only willing to support an issue when it is: non-controversial, does not require him to act as a leader and does not ask him to explain a complicated issue to a potentially hostile electorate.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis' record is full of such blemishes:</span></p> <p><span>. When he first ran for Governor in 1974, he made his famous \"lead pipe\" promise not to raise taxes. During his first administration, he implemented a wonderful device known as a surtax--i.e., a tax on your taxes. During his 1986 campaign for reelection, he conveniently decided to repeal the surtax, which allowed him to claim on the presidential campaign trail that he had cut taxes.</span></p> <p><span>. During the Iowa caucuses, Dukakis aired commercials criticizing the Reagan adminstration for failing to address the problem of homelessness. In the commercial, Dukakis uses an exploitative picture of a homeless person outside the White House. Perhaps Dukakis had been in Iowa so long he had forgotten that his campaign could just have easily used a similar picture outside the State House in Boston.</span></p> <p><span>. In recent weeks Dukakis has criticized some of his opponents for being influenced by the money of political action committees. Dukakis' financial records, however, are far from suspect; his campaign accepts contributions from state contractors and Massachusetts employees.</span></p> <p><span>. Dukakis has always prided himself on being a hands-on manager, yet he has detached himself from his presidential campaign--claiming he had no knowledge of the smear campaign against Joseph Biden mounted by his best friend and campaign manager, John Sasso.</span></p> <p><span>Flip-flopping on the issues and using dirty tricks are nothing new to campaigns. and Massachusetts politics and this presidential election are no exception. In the Democratic field alone, Rep. Richard Gephart and Sen. Albert Gore, Jr. are far worse offenders. But Mike Dukakis, no stranger to accusations of arrogance, likes say he holds himself to a higher standard.</span></p> <p><span>Mike Dukakis is the guy who treks across the country talking about honesty, integrity and responsible leadership. But it's not much more than talk. Mike Dukakis is like the tough little kid in the schoolyard who brags a lot but won't stick around to prove himself in a fight.</span></p> <p><span>Remember that if you support Mike Dukakis because he managed to get a comprehensive health care package through the Massachusetts Legislature. How tough will Dukakis be when he faces the first real Republican opposition of his life in the United States Senate?</span></p>"}

Where there's a yin. there must be a yang.</span></p> <p><span>Super Tuesday was useful not so much in selecting a major Southern presidential candidate as it was in picking a nominee. And so with the rest of the primaries meaning nothing--for the Republicans at least--it is little coincidence that the brokering for the vice presidential spot has already begun. It is even less surprising that many of those now brokering for vice president were instrumental in getting Super Tuesday adopted.</span></p> <p><span>The South gave the Republicans George Bush, and now the GOP has five months to find someone willing to run with him. At this early stage, <i>Time,</i> in a fit of self-restraint, threw out half a dozen possibilities in a mini-story this week.</span></p> <p><span>Vice presidents, as a species, are counted on to deliver states by convincing people that they, as official White House Cheerleader, will be worth the regional favorite son vote. Their function ends as soon as the election does.</span></p> <p><span>In personality, the VP must be as opposite to the president as possible in the name of balancing the ticket. The VP must be weaker and, if possible, shorter than the presidential nominee.</span></p> <p><span>Finding someone who is a vertibrate, yet weaker than Bush, will be extremely tough for the GOP. There are plenty of intelligent, forceful, conservative and deep-voiced people out there to add non-Bush qualities to the Republican ticket, but they don't fulfill the descriptions of the jellyfish needed to make Bush look good. After all Bush just spent eight years making Reagan look good. Practice makes perfect, and George Bush has made playing the jelly-fish into an art form.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>o one is predicting Bob Dole will kiss and make up with Bush to be picked as vice president. With his temperament, he will be picked Sectretary of Defense, but not vice president. Besides, Dole has too many principles to bury his hatchet with Bush the way Bush did with Reagan--unless he aims it at George's back.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, most of the Republicans being mentioned for the vice presidency have too much character to be seen running behind a tumbleweed like Bush. Former cabinet members Elizabeth Dole and Jean Kirkpatrick would both quiet all the hecklers Bush would attract on the campaign trail and Congressman Jack Kemp would embarass Bush in physique alone. A photo opportunity with Kemp passing a football to Bush would end up with someone hurt.</span></p> <p><span>And other Republicans, most notably Howard Baker, realize that the way to stay the darlings of the inside-the-beltway elite is to let someone else make pitches on behalf of George Bush in Alabama and kansas. Why should Baker run for the White House when he's already there?</span></p> <p><span>California Gov. George Duekmajian is boring enough to be Bush's vice, but he couldn't deliver the Earthquake State as easily as another major politician would. One George is enough.</span></p> <p><span>No, the only Republican who can garner a lot of national votes even in a weakened, near-comatose condition is Ronald Reagan, who can legally run for vice president now that the curtains have closed on his run as the Commander in Chief. Besides, he wants to travel now, and what does a VP do besides travel? \"Bush-Reagan in '88.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>U</b>nfortunately for the Democrats, Super Tuesday didn't clear the air for proper VP speculation. It's still hard to tell their vice presidential candidates from their presidential candidates. The Democrats may very well kill themselves sifting the two groups out, but let's indulge ourselves in some of the rational possibilities.</span></p> <p><span>For his part, the Rev. Jesse Jackson is already picking running mates--which should give you some indication of how good his chances are at the nomination. The Boston Herald reported last week that Boston Mayor Ray Flynn has been mentioned by Jackson as a strong possibility. But then, so have Pat Schoeder, Jim Wright, Jimmy Carter and Fidel Castro.</span></p> <p><span>If Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis does better than Jackson in the remaining contests, Jesse will probably give his delegates and support to the Duke in exchange for placing Prince Albert Gore in the VP spot. Jackson and Gore are actually close personal friends and could do all the necessary brokering in Atlanta between themselves over lunch.</span></p> <p><span>But once America figures out how Northeastern Gore is, his ability to deliver the crucial South will be severely diminished. Jackson could deliver the South, but unfortunately, he would send much of the country Federal Express to the GOP. America doesn't yet have the <i>chutzpah</i> to vote for a Black preacher with no political experience.</span></p> <p><span>And, as with Howard Baker, all the Outsiders that the Democrats dream about getting to run with Dukakis are too intelligent to get involved in a national election. Mario Cuomo, Sam Nunn and Bill Bradley would rather remain darlings of the media than play the straight man.</span></p> <p><span>It's been 20 years since the party that won Texas lost the overall election, so the Democrats could pick San Antonio mayor Henry Cisneros in an effort to give Bush a battle in his own front yard. But he doesn't come from Dallas or Houston, and besides, Dukakis has already demonstrated that he can win the Hispanic vote in the South without a Hispanic to translate for him.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he fact that Bush has no recognizable heritage is no reason to rule out an \"ethnic\" candidate as the second choice on the Democratic ticket, but the pundits are already saying Dukakis the Greek is minority enough. The Democrats need a vice president who is non-ethnic and who is non-Harvard, which will be hard, considering everyone in the party fits one of those two catagories.</span></p> <p><span>The Democrats need to call back a true mainstream populist, one who is enormously popular and larger than the gap between the parties he jumped decades ago--and one who could give the Democrats California besides. \"Dukakis-Reagan, '88.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Mr. President, a-la Megabucks | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>F</b>LORENZO DiDonato campaigns every time an election rolls around. It doesn't seem to matter to him which office he's running for. In last week's primary DiDonato, a local resident, was third on the ballot for President. In 1986 he ran for the 8th Congressiona! district seat. To my knowledge, he's never won anything, and it seems a shame.</span></p> <p><span>It's too bad because he appears to be a really nice guy. He tools around in his van on election day with huge banners on the sides that say \"DiDonato for\"...He fills in the space with the current office he's running for, talks over the P.A. system mounted on top of the van, sings songs to the people on the streets, and reminds them to vote. He has a really good time. Last week he was singing \"He's Got the Whole World In His Hands,\" and I for one really appreciated it. I've never had a presidential candidate sing to me before. He wasn't an especially good singer, but he seemed to mean what he was singing, and it brightened my day.</span></p> <p><span>So why doesn't a guy who can make you feel good about the electoral process ever get a shot at the big time? If the Reagan years proved anything, it's that a person doesn't need intelligence or experience to run this country. Florenzo DiDonato is just an average Joe who would make a fine President, but he's denied his American birthright by a system that has grown wildly out of proportion to the needs of the nation.</span></p> <p><span>I for one am sick to death of the way the presidential election is being carried on these days. The candidates don't inspire me, let alone sing to me, and I can't take much more of the endless bickering, endless polling or endless speculation by newscasters who need to fill six hours of their \"Election '88\" specials every primary day. The ability of the media to predict public opinion has taken the fun and luck out of politics. Under today's system there's no chance that we'll ever see the excitement of a surprise upset such as Harry Truman's win against Dewey in 1948.</span></p> <p><span>Politics used to be entertaining. But now I find myself gagging uncontrollably each time I hear a candidate's $50,000 TV commercial explaining why I should consider the smiling bureaucrat to be \"One of Us\". The fact that these candidates happen to be human isn't enough. The day I find out that George Bush is related to me through any connection other than a purely biological one is the day I take a gun to my head.</span></p> <p><span>Rather than simply complaining, though, I actually want to do something about this disturbing situation. I feel that our country has moved too far from the original concept that anyone can become President. People like DiDonato should have as much chance as an Al Gore or a Mike Dukakis. There's a perfect solution--one that would give the common people a chance to influence the system which governs them, that would open up the political process, and that would finally give us a President who could lead this country without first requiring that he sell his soul to the PACs, pollsters and TV ad executives.</span></p> <p><span>Hold a lottery.</span></p> <p><span>This wouldn't be a sleazy gambling type lottery, but something akin to the noble practice of jury duty. Every year the IRS's magnificent computers could be programmed to randomly choose the name of the people who would lead our country for the upcoming year.</span></p> <p><span>Imagine the possibilities. No more would we have to suffer through hopelessly boring special reports on each state's primary. A lottery would inject the suspense and the excitement back into the process. Will the new President be Black or white, male or female, Jewish or Indian, rich or poor, intelligent or stupid? There would be no way to know, and this would make the system truly democratic.</span></p> <p><span>No longer would we be subjected to months of the endless scrutiny of the candidates, their qualifications and their personal habits the media force on us. Now, there simply wouldn't be time. The whole thing could be done in a few hours. Nor would this hurt the media--the show could become a single night's entertainment extravaganza, like the Academy Awards. The networks could rotate the rights each year and charge the most exorbitant advertising rates ever conceived of. Ronald Reagan could be the M.C.</span></p> <p><span>Also, none of the cost burdens would ever again be shouldered by the candidates, thereby releasing our public officials from any commitments they have made with PACs or wealthy supporters. They could be totally objective and simply work in the best interests of the country.</span></p> <p><span>Because they would only be chosen for one year terms, our Presidents wouldn't have time to mess anything up, and, of course, our system of checks and balances would take care of anyone too off-the-wall. But the most positive aspect of the lottery would be the chance for different interest groups to win some representation. An Armenian President would focus on the Armenian situation in the U.S.S.R. and would have the means to talk to Gorbachev about the problem. An elderly person as President could strengthen Social Security during their term in office. A teacher could give lots of money to education. A psychopath could give lots of money to defense. No one could legitimately complain about not being represented anymore, because all would have an equal chance.</span></p> <p><span>So let's start a movement for the common man; let the people decide. Write your congressman proposing a Constitutional amendment: the Lottery to Ultimately Mandate the President amendment. Let's make politics fun for everyone again.</span></p>"}

Colonel Oliver North and former National Security Advisor John Poindexter, were indicted for their role in the secret maneuverings that led to selling arms to the Ayatollah and funneling funds to the rebels in Nicaragua. The indictments, one hopes, will do what the dramatic hearings on the affair failed to do: make it clear that crimes were committed and that the Constitution was bypassed.</span></p> <p><span>The language of the indictments says forcefully and clearly what the president, not to mention the vice president, should have said long ago about the covert doings, terming them \"a program to continue funding of and logisitical and other support for military and paramilitary operations\" at a time when the law prevented such action.</span></p> <p><span>The rest of the counts in the indictment are commentary. The shredding of documents, the failure to cooperate with investigators, the lying to Congress--all of it is effect rather than cause. It is the disregard for the will of the Congress--and thus the will of the people--and the single-minded determination to back the contras even when the nation had made known its opposition to that support, that must be punished. The other actions are only the inevitable consequences of one branch of government taking the law unto its own hands.</span></p> <p><span>And that crime, which is also the breaking of a trust, seems to rest on the shoulders not only of the men who carried out the missions, but on the men who lead that branch of government--namely the president and the vice president. For as much as the individual actions of Hakim and Secord, North and Poindexter were criminal, the policy of the Reagan administration itself should not escape condemnation. To this day, neither the president nor Vice President Bush will back off from dubbing North and Poindexter \"heroes,\" nor will they concede that it was not Congress which had demanded ending aid to the contras, but the people through the Congress. Still they back the intentions of their men, pretending that it is enough to say that \"mistakes were made\" when talking about being faithful to fundamental precepts of democracy. With North's resignation from the marines, he has promised to subpoena \"high officials\" to defend him. Perhaps on the witness stand, those who made the policy will finally be forced to take responsibility for its undemocratic nature.</span></p> <p><span>Such stubbornness and disrespect for both the Constitution and the citizenry only means that in the end we can expect President Reagan to issue pardons. We can also expect that the pardons will come long after the election is over, which may even be long after Vice President Bush has been elected his successor. If this were to come to pass, it would be hard to have much faith, either in a Constitution which could allow such deeds to go unpunished, or in a citizenry which could allow such deeds to be repeated. As slowly as the wheels of justice may turn, turn they must. the indictments are long overdue. And if they result in a slew of convictions, who is a president to say otherwise?</span></p>"}

We have long found his claim difficult to believe. Last week our doubts increased.</span></p> <p><span>According to media reports, Bush is the only presidential candidate of either party to refuse to take part in Marvin Kalb's excellent series of nationally televised interviews, \"Candidates '88\". Kalb, director of the Kennedy School's Center for Press, Politics and Public Policy, is an incisive questioner whose televised exchanges with Michael Dukakis, born-again candidate Gary Hart and Paul Simon are among the most substantial of the campaign. Kalb certainly would have questioned the vice president about evidence--including a recently surfaced memo signed by former National Security Council chief John Poindexter--that suggests Bush's support for the plan to trade arms for hostages held in Iran was stronger than he has acknowledged.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's campaign maintains that he decided against participating in the \"Candidates '88\" interview series because of scheduling pressures. Barbara Pardue, Bush's press secretary, points out that the candidate has been interviewed by David Frost and Barbara Walters and appeared on NBC's Meet the Press. Yet the \"half day\" Pardue said it would take Bush to \"do a good job\" on Kalb's hour-long program, which is taped in the Kennedy School's Arco Forum and broadcast on PBS, shouldn't be difficult to find in the schedule of a candidate who all but resides in neighboring New Hampshire. And Bush's television interviews to date have either preceded disclosures about the Iran-contra affair or been puff jobs during which the vice president has ducked tough questions.</span></p> <p><span>That's why Bob Dole's recent, forceful questioning of Bush's Iran-contra role is entirely in order. We hope that Bush recognizes the validity of concerns about his knowledge of the fiasco and soon discloses his involvement. It is not a hopeful sign, however, that so far his only concrete response to his chief rival for the Republican nomination has been to suggest--apparently without merit--a conflict of interest associated with the handling of Elizabeth Dole's blind trust and to call for the Kansas senator to release income taxes for the past 10 years. Perhaps Dole is no longer the poor Dust Bowl boy he once was, but we'd like to know whether the vice president supported the arms-for-hostages swap just the same.</span></p> <p><span>With $23 million raised and a still comfortable lead in the polls, Bush, like his boss, evidently feels no need to answer tough questions. That in effect is what he told Kalb when he declined to be interviewed. What he told the American people is that he would be their president without putting his case before them.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Good Morning San Francisco | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Harvard students, unlike other anthropoid primates but like certain arboreal rodents and members of the ursine order, undergo peculiar physiological shifts as the nights lengthen and the weather turns cold. A pallor sets in around the cheeks and jaw, the hair becomes dishevelled, and exhaustion and bad breath replace the generally sunny, if somewhat offstandish, demeanor. As the progress continues, cause feeds on effect, creating a downward spiral of personal appearance and emotional well-being.</span></p> <p><span>These changes occur in synchrony with the environment, primed, as it were, by the unrelentingly constant rhythms of the natural and academic calenders. The shortest day of the year, December 21, for example, marks not only a collapse in the skin's production of life-sustaining vitamin D, but also the second day of Winter Break, when, as tradition holds, Reading Period guilt first manifests itself.</span></p> <p><span>My vital forces had been decaying in this manner for several weeks when a phone rang in my dark, airless, and bitterly cold cubicle one day in the first week of January. Overwhelmed as it was by the whistle of the arctic gale forcing its way through fist-size holes in the plastic wrap covering my window, the sound of the ringer at first hardly reached me through the pile of soiled rags into which I had burrowed for warmth.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, however, I discerned the ringing and paused from chewing on stale walnut shells to answer the phone.</span></p> <p><span>It was The Crimson. \"Jeff,\" came a voice from Cambridge's only breakfast table daily. \"Do you want to go to San Francisco on a movie junket?\"</span></p> <p><span>The origins of the Hollywood junket are shrouded in the dim mysteries of the past, but in its most recent incarnations it has become a fusion of two distinct traditions. The first of these traditions is the expense account, by which the wealth of the nation is funneled out of the hands of the worker via the conduit of large corporations and is then frittered away by hedonistically juvenile executives. The second tradition is that of the star schmooze, in which second string critics from minor newspapers in unimportant cities have lunch with celebrities while asking questions like, \"So, what was it like working with Eddie?\" as though Mr. Murphy were a mutual friend.</span></p> <p><span>But while the average movie junket generally carries less global import then, say, a world war, or even--surprise--a baby vomiting in Buffalo, there are several salient features of the junket experience that may redeem it for some people. For example, the booze, which is free, or the deluxe hotel room, which similarly is gratis. Or the chance to run amok in a strange city where no one knows you--and not be one penny poorer for the opportunity.</span></p> <p><span>But when the call came in for the San Francisco junket, one thought in particular swayed my mind: that there was no way, no possible way, that San Francisco could be as cold as Boston.</span></p> <p><span>So all things put in the balance--a sense of guilt for leaving a morass of schoolwork unfinished, on the one hand; a single-minded psychotic unwillingness to remain one more second in Cambridge on the other--I welcomed the opportunity to rise before dawn on Friday, the 8th of January, to begin the long journey to San Francisco. Because one is flying west against the predominant winds and counter to the rotation of the earth, departure must be delayed, the inflight food is half-charred-half-frozen, and you gain three hours on landing. Probably an astrophsyicist could figure this out.</span></p> <p><span>When I got off the plane I resisted the temptation to make a joke about blood transfusions and headed straight for the hotel--the lovely Four Seasons, conveniently located between the business district and the adult entertainment zone. At the reception desk I was greeted, registered, and given my press materials, which I perused at my leisure in my well-appointed single.</span></p> <p><span>Opening the brown envelope which contained the press kits for the two films we would be covering in the junket, I read the titles: \"Shoot to Kill,\" and \"Good Morning, Vietnam.\" Then I went to the hospitality suite down the hall and dug into the free and well-stocked bar. Several hours more than several cost-free beverages later, I found myself sitting in a bar wondering why the five gentlemen to my left had stripped naked and were dancing around, waving to the other patrons in the bar and passers-by who were gawking through the open door of the saloon.</span></p> <p><span>But this, unfortunately, was about as strange as it got. The time the waitress in the topless bar ran screaming after a man with a thick Greek accent threatening to kill him was unaccountable, but not really strange. Most of the time was spent as an accountant at Touchstone Pictures might have planned, attending brunches, talking with celebrities, attending luncheons, watching movies, attending dinners. We members of the press accumulated our meticulous notes and tape-recordings, got tipsy, ate too much, and sat around being friendly with strangers.</span></p> <p><span>The Touchstone people--media reps would probably be the technical term for the dedicated individuals obliged to look after our needs--were exquisitely attentive, behaving as though they expected our opinions to have the slightest effect on the final box office gross their pictures would pull in. Deluded, no doubt, but so much the better for us.</span></p> <p><span>One young reporter confessed to me a certain unease with the ethics of the situation. Was there not a conflict of interest here? he wondered, free drink in hand.</span></p> <p><span>I told him that movie critics need to worry about ethics like a Bedouin needs to worry about drowning.</span></p> <p><span>Saturday night we were placed on board buses and driven down to a nearby cinema for the screening of \"Good Morning, Vietnam.\" Apparently, some of the locals hoped to catch the show as well: the line in front of the box office snaked halfway around the block. As we were ushered into our reserved seating, some of the hoi-polloi greeted us with hisses, jealous no doubt of our preferred status.</span></p> <p><span>\"This section for national press only,\" said the Vietnamese usher. At this the second-stringer from Washington leaned over to me and whispered, \"Did you hear that? The national press is here.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Individually, we're the local press,\" explained another. \"But collectively, we're the national press.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Oh,\" said the first.</span></p> <p><span>Coming back to Boston Sunday night, I had that awful morning-after feeling that comes from a combination of guilt and alcohol poisoning. True, I had escaped the city that spawned Michael Dukakis for three precious days. True, in that time the thermometer had risen back into the positive numbers. But somewhere in the back of my mind I wondered if I had lived up to my obligations. Might I have tried just a little bit harder to wring a few more drops of alcohol from the mini-bar? Might I have pressed a little bit harder for an expense account receipt from the topless bar? Mightn't I have had just a little bit more fun?</span></p> <p><span>That, in the long run, is the ethical dilemma of the Hollywood junket.  <n><i>Our intrepid reporter face down in the gutter: He left his heart and GPA in San Francisco and his dinner on the floor of his hotel room.</i>\n</n></span></p>"}
{"title": "Dukakis Unveils Budget Proposal, Stresses Social Services, Discipline | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Calling his spending plan an investment in people, Governor Michael S. Dukakis unveiled a record-high $12 billion budget proposal for the fiscal year 1989 at a news conference yesterday at the State House.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis' plan raises spending by $857 million, a 7.2 percent increase over fiscal year 1988. The governor, stressing the state's solid job growth and low unemployment rate, called for an expansion of state government spending without any new taxes.</span></p> <p><span>Although the governor proposes to increase welfare spending by 5.5 percent, 10 members of the Coalition For Basic Human Needs, a group representing welfare recipients, protested the proposal at the press conference.</span></p> <p><span>\"A 5.5 percent increase is only about 30 cents per day per person,\" said Dottie Stevens, the group's president.</span></p> <p><span>Carol Brill, a spokesman for the National Association of Social Workers, said that \"welfare recipients are being asked to eat the scraps on the table of plenty in Massachusetts.\" Brill added that inflation and foodstamp reductions will negate any increase in welfare spending.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis' budget calls for increased spending in public education, health care, employment training and public housing. The governor said that revenues to support the increases in human services will come from an estimated 3.3 percent real economic growth and tougher enforcement of tax laws.</span></p> <p><span>Echoing his plan to shrink the federal deficit through stricter enforcement of the tax code, the Democratic presidential candidate asked for an extra $22 million for the state Revenue Department, which he said would yield $190 million in extra taxes per year.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis said that strong enforcement and collection efforts would also work on the federal level to reduce the budget deficit--although the other Democratic candidates have discounted the idea. \"I'm not quite sure I've convinced my colleagues in the debates yet,\" the governor said.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis stressed that his budget complies with the balanced budget provisions of Massachusetts law. \"We're not going to spend what we don't have,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>\"Any budget is a plan that has to make assumptions about revenues, about the economic future and about appropriations,\" said Dukakis, who asked voters to judge him by his economic record of 10 years.</span></p> <p><span>The Dukakis budget recommends that the Commonwealth conform to the Federal Tax Reform Act of 1986, which eliminated many tax loopholes. \"Forty-two of 44 states with a state income tax have plugged the loopholes for the wealthy. I would hate to be the one state that hasn't, \"he said.</span></p> <p><span>After assessing his state budget, Dukakis responded to the question of whether presidential candidates should submit federal budget proposals during the campaign. Gary Hart confronted Dukakis at Monday night's Faneuil Hall debate, saying that any candidate unable to put together a budget proposal now did not deserve to be president.</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday, Dukakis again called Hart's statement \"absolutely ridiculous,\" and said, \"Anyone who thinks you can prepare a budget one year in advance doesn't know how we do this. The notion that you can is absurd.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Taking New Hampshire by Storm | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>With the critical Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primaries only days away, Harvard students are hitting the campaign trail.</span></p> <p><span>Part of a national attempt to mobilize student workers, these undergraduates and recent graduates are going all out to turn the tide for faltering candidates and help push campaigns of popular candidates down the long road to the summer conventions.</span></p> <p><span>Undergraduates hold key positions in several campaigns, and all the major candidates have support groups on campus. Massive student participation in the presidential campaigns dates back to 1968. In that year, an exodus of Massachusetts student voters handed Eugene McCarthy a stunning New Hampshire primary victory, revealing that Harvard and other colleges can be sources for manpower and enthusiasm important for a successful presidential drive.</span></p> <p><span>\"Students have always provided enthusiasm and excitement,\" says Ariela J. Gross '87, national student coordinator for the Michael S. Dukakis For President campaign. More importantly, in small states like New Hampshire student volunteers can reach enough registered voters to make the difference between and upset victory and a suprising defeat, workers say. An early win New Hampshire or elsewhere, can build momentum for a presidential race, while a poor showing can kill a candidate's hopes at the beginning of a campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Student volunteers play a crucial role in February. All candidates hope to show strongly in either Iowa or New Hampshire and so they need volunteers who can canvass entire towns in a few hours.</span></p> <p><span>\"The most important thing we do at this point is getting people up to New Hampshire,\" says Jane E. Arnold '90, campus coordinator for Congressman Richard Gephardt (D.-Mo.) When participating on a canvassing trip, students receive a short orientation as they arrive at New Hampshire sites, load up with literature and lists of voters, and head out. Campaigns provide transportation, food and organization.</span></p> <p><span>Although the vast majority of student campaign workers are part-time volunteers, a number of Harvard undergraduates and recent graduates have taken full-time jobs on the campaign. Evan O. Grossman '87-'88 is one such worker. Having warmed up in 1984 as an advance man for the Democratic ticket of Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro, he now works for Dukakis as an analyst and coordinator. His job includes compiling daily delegate counts, financial information and logistical data.</span></p> <p><span>Grossman says he has put in 15-hour days at campaign headquarters in recent weeks now that his honors thesis in Social Studies is complete. \"It's difficult for students who are busy with exams and classes to have the time for a campaign,\" Grossman says. \"I tried not to sleep too much.\"</span></p> <p><span>Students working across party lines are equally dedicated. James D. Chung '88 is one of Sen. Robert Dole's (R.-Kan.) lead advance men in New England and Washington, D.C. A native of Wichita, Kansas, Chung worked for Dole during his earlier years in the Senate and joined the campaign last July.</span></p> <p><span>\"When I'm working, I'm up at six and not asleep until two a.m.,\" the Cabot House resident says. \"It's harsh, really, really harsh.\" Chung is surviving 100-hour work weeks right now, working almost like a nanny. His job includes waking his candidate, feeding him, sending him to smaller events, putting him into holding rooms, preparing for other events, and finally putting him to bed at around 10 p.m. \"Then I begin doing all the work for the next day,\" Chung says.</span></p> <p><span>The students working on campaigns may not be spending much time in their classes, but they are getting an education in the inner workings of politics. \"The toughest thing is balancing all the different factions within the campaign as well as the people outside,\" Chung says. \"Everyone has different goals, different ideas of what the senator should do.\"</span></p> <p><span>One of the groups participating in this political tug of war includes the student workers themselves. Since Gary Hart's presidential drive emphasizes \"new ideas\" and appeals for student activism, young people play key roles in shaping the candidate's policies, supporters say. Alan Khazei '83, resident scholar in law and public service at Currier House is a long-time Hart supporter. He coordinated 15 percent of the precincts in New Hampshire for Hart's 1984 victory and now works as a speechwriter and organizer in the newly revitalized drive.</span></p> <p><span>Khazei says he worked closely on the formulation of Hart's proposals for national public service legislation, which proposes compulsory community service work for college-age youth. Hart's college organizers say that they like Hart's \"progressive, national\" vision, and Khazei says that workers in their early twenties will be more numerous in Hart's campaign than in any other candidate's.</span></p> <p><span><b>Affecting the Issues</b></span></p> <p><span>Student campaign workers say that student interests have also affected the issues that other candidates have focused on. At the Dukakis camp, Grossman says young people want the next president to address issues that have disrupted campuses nationwide such as Central America, apartheid and the homeless. And Avram S. Brown '88-89, co-coordinator for Hart at Harvard, says many students want a candidate who is \"not willing to rely on traditional liberal solutions,\" which is how Hart couches his appeal.</span></p> <p><span>When appealing to student workers and voters, Republican candidate Pat Robertson focuses on his fundamentalist religion and his conservative views on family and education, says Michael D. Lord '90, Robertson's youth co-ordinator for the New England region. He says that these views run counter to those held by \"the Washington and party establishment.\"</span></p> <p><span>Youth outreach groups like Robertson's serve two purposes: they win over college-age voters and drum up more volunteers for the crucial canvassing that can win primaries. The Democrats in particular have made strong efforts to send volunteer to meet New Hampshire voters.</span></p> <p><span>The student volunteer efforts center on small core groups of workers which consistently travel to New Hampshire or campaign headquarters in Boston where they man telephones and lick envelopes, leaders say. These groups vary in size from a handful of supporters for candidates such as Al Haig or Bruce Babbitt, to 20 or 30 backers for Dole, Bush or Dukakis.</span></p> <p><span>Benefits for volunteers may include after-hour visits from candidates, social mixing with other students, and debating with voters. Brown says New Hampshire residents are \"fiercely politically and willing to question canvassers about their candidates while maintaining an independent viewpoint.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis' young campaign workers last fall tried another campaign technique. Gross says college students helped create the first-ever satellite conference in a presidential election when Dukakis addressed students in 56 colleges in 25 states via a satellite hookup last November.</span></p> <p><span><b>Registering New Voters</b></span></p> <p><span>While most candidates ask their volunteers to concentrate on winning votes, the Rev. Jesse Jackson's supporters at Harvard and nationwide have been an exception. The Jackson workers instead try to register new voters. Jackson's Massachusetts campus coordinator H. Edward Young Jr. '89 says volunteers at the College will be recruiting voters in Cambridge. \"Jackson keeps pushing that Americans need to vote,\" Young says. He adds that Jackson's campaign registered 3 million voters in 1984 and hopes to beat that record this year.</span></p> <p><span>Besides the Jackson campaign, however, candidates' student groups have similar agendas for this spring. Most plan weekend canvassing trips to New Hampshire over the next two weeks, coupled with more campus publicity. Most groups do not anticipate any more visits by presidential hopefuls, although every candidate except for Vice President George Bush came to Harvard's Institute of Politics this fall for Murrow Professor of Press and Public Policy Marvin S. Kalb's series of interviews.</span></p> <p><span>Although most of the campaigns have been able to assemble small collections of individuals for canvassing, most have had trouble pulling in larger groups of students. L. Ellen Cox '89, co-president of Harvard's Republican Club and co-chairman of Harvard Students for Dole, says, \"With Harvard kids, it's tough to pin them down with volunteering. Everyone has a lot of activities.\"</span></p> <p><span>Other student leaders say that apathy keeps the majority of the student body inactive. However, Ann-Marie Leshkowich '89, president of the Harvard Democrats Club, says she thinks student activism is on the rise and will continue to grow as the campaign progresses. \"Students are interested but they need a sense that they make a difference,\" Leshkowich says. She adds Harvard's schedule makes campaigning difficult, because exam and registration schedules in the fall and winter conflict with important political events.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Harvard Hazards: Red Dots, Green Dots... | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Registration proctor Thomas E. Glannon said he knew it was going to be a long day yesterday when someone walked up to him in Memorial Hall and asked for John Harvard's registration packet.</span></p> <p><span>Glannon said he searched frantically for the packet and had no success. The student who had claimed to be the University's benefactor then laughed, and apologized for inconveniencing Glannon, the proctor said.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm not registered as John Harvard,\" the student said, giving the name he was registered under.</span></p> <p><span>Pranksters aside, Glannon said that the vast majority of the 6500 registering students were quite good natured. \"Mostly people seemed to be quite patient,\" Glannon said. \"I've been surprised at how extremely polite and aware people have been.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Dread Red Dots</b></span></p> <p><span>But some of the approximately 1600 students who received red dots on their registration packets said they felt less polite than they appeared. Students whose envelopes bore the dreaded red spots were prohibited from registering because some portion of their term bill remained unpaid.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of receiving their study cards and other material in the main hall, these students were sent to Room 201, where they tried to clear up their term bill troubles.</span></p> <p><span>\"I waited in line for an hour. and when I got up there they said, `Oh, you have signed a loan slip? Well then here's your blue slip. You can go,' \"said Jonathan B. Bush '91. \"What B.S.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"It took them an hour to find out that instead of owing money my parents had actually overpaid,\" LeeAnn Ebert-Einert '91 said.</span></p> <p><span>The extra wait soured many students on the entire process. \"By the time you get the packet, you don't even want it,\" Lori M. Wiviott '88 said.</span></p> <p><span>Although red dots earned universal hatred, students said they have learned to like the other dots found on registration packets. Green dots saved them time, the students said, by alerting them to the fact that they could sign their loan cards in Memorial Hall and thus avoid a trek to the fifth floor of Holyoke Center.</span></p> <p><span>\"Green dots are a wicked good idea,\" said one student, who asked not to be identified.</span></p> <p><span>Dots weren't the only hazard students had to navigate yesterday. As they entered and left Memorial Hall students found themselves confronted by giant, overhanging partitions with signs urging them to join--for fun and profit--various student organizations.</span></p> <p><span>\"Jimmy Carter and Rajiv Gandhi have written for the Harvard International Review. You can too,\" one sign read.</span></p> <p><span>Many organizations used more than posters to recruit new members. In the alcove between the main hall and Sanders Theatre, members of student organizations accosted their fellow students and tried to convince them to give up their free time for the sake of worthy or enjoyable causes. Recruiters for Paul Simon's presidential campaign even brought a television on which they displayed a video presentation.</span></p> <p><span>For the students manning the activity tables, business ranged from non-existent to frantic. When the noon lecture of Social Analysis 10, \"The Principles of Economics,\" ended crowds of people surged into the room, and the tables were overwhelmed with activity seekers. But the rush soon subsided. When the tables were not too crowded, these volunteers had time to complain about their situation. They said they found the corridor lacking in a few necessities.</span></p> <p><span>\"We want a few floodlights,\" Donald J. Ridings '90 said.</span></p> <p><span>\"...and maybe a space heater or two,\" Clara N. Lee '89 added, before telling two students that Harvard has no systematic AIDS education program, and that they could help organize one.</span></p> <p><span>The registration proctors also said they found their part of the process difficult. \"The hardest part of proctoring is that the back of your neck gets really stiff,\" said Glannon. \"I had to give someone a massage on the lower back so he could keep going, he was so stiff and sore.\"</span></p> <p><span>In addition to complaining, many students suggested ways to improve the registration process. Several said they thought registration should not take place on the first day of classes because it can cause scheduling conflicts, especially for those who have been red-dotted.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm taking two course in which attendance is mandatory, and registering [today] could have caused me to miss lunch,\" Jeremy B. Rudd '91 said.</span></p> <p><span>\"Registration should be on the day before [the first day of classes],\" George Goon '91 said. \"If you have a problem with red-dotting, it might tie you up all day.</span></p> <p><span>This complaint may become a thing of the past, because College officials have decided to schedule next fall's registration on the Friday before classes start. <i>(See story page 1)</i></span></p> <p><span>But to some students, the whole process of registration seemed superfluous. \"If we just pick up a packet and leave, why couldn't they mail it to us?\" Christopher Chabris '88 queried.</span></p> <p><span>\"It seems a little primitive,\" said another student. \"After 350 years they're still doing it this way.</span></p> <p><span>But most students said they thought that registration, while it has some drawbacks, should not be lambasted. It works, they said, even if it is imperfect. \"After all, you get to see people you don't see often,\" said Wiviott.</span></p>"}
{"title": "ABC Wins Super Bowl | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>L</b>AST Sunday afternoon the real TV action did not kick off at 6:30--with Super Bowl XXII's first down--but at 4:00. IBM computers, Hanes underwear, Volkswagen cars and ABC's <i>World News Tonight</i> were the starting players.</span></p> <p><span>The actual sports event, between a team from Denver and another from the nation's capital, was really only a sideshow to the biggest commercial extravaganza of the year. The broadcast's real highlight came when Pepsi and Coca-Cola unveiled their brand new commercials.</span></p> <p><span>If you watched the entire Super Bowl broadcast from pre-game to postgame, you endured only 60 minutes of actual live football, but you saw more than 180 commercials comprising more than 90 minutes of advertising messages. And except for the action-packed second quarter of the game, the commercials provided most of the program's thrills.</span></p> <p><span>There were bigger stars off the field than on it. Former <i>M*A*S*H</i> stars Harry Morgan, Jamie Farr, and Wayne Rogers took the field for the IBM team, tossing around football lingo to sell computers. The Smothers Brothers joked for Magnavox, and Eric Clapton sang the praises of Michelob.</span></p> <p><span>And of course, two superstar teams from the soda world battled fiercely: Pierce Brosnan (TV's <i>Remington Steele</i>) and Demi Moore <i>(St. Elmo's Fire)</i> for Coke vs. Michael J. Fox, Jami Gertz <i>(Less than Zero)</i> and Teri Garr for Pepsi.</span></p> <p><span>Pierce Brosnan's James Bond-ish chase-on-top-of-a-moving-train for Diet Coke reportedly cost more than $1 million to film, and it was a disappointment. The commercial tries to cram too many tense moments into too few seconds. The viewer spends so much time trying to firgure out where Brosnan is--hanging off a train or clambering on top--that there is no time to get scared. And then it ends--with Brosnan sipping his soda happily ever after.</span></p> <p><span>But Michael J. Fox has come up with his third straight Pepsi winner. Fox and Gertz battle a loud and hyperactive dog in their attempt to get a Pepsi from a vending machine while they're lost on the road.</span></p> <p><span>The ad is understated and endearing. Unlike Coke's moving train, the set is simple, the action comprehensible. Here Pepsi becomes the object of the escapade, not just an afterthought. As Fox climbs in and out of a car to avoid the obviously harmless canine and grab a drink, his acrobatics remind the viewer of his last good Pepsi commercial (where he climbs out of his apartment to get a Pepsi for his attractive neighbor).</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>BC knows that among the 10 most-watched television programs of all time, five of them are Super Bowl broadcasts. In every two-and-a-half minute set of commercials, ABC kept at least 30 seconds to itself--especially promoting its news program and the new show <i>The Wonder Years.</i></span></p> <p><span>ABC hopes to pick up some new viewers in the aftermath of the Dan Rather/George Bush fiasco on the usually top-rated <i>CBS Evening News.</i> So the network aired commercials touting the credibility of its news department, with paeans to Peter Jennings every half-hour. And Peter Jennings made a rare Sunday appearance with a special news report during the pre-game show.</span></p> <p><span>ABC was also mindful of pulling in viewers for the month of February, which is known in the industry as `sweeps' month and is a crucial period for ratings tests. All networks set their future advertising rates from their audience levels in February. So ABC promoted its upcoming 75 hours of Winter Olympic coverage with reports from Calgary and a blitz of commercials.</span></p> <p><span>In recent years, it's become a tradition to debut a new series after the Super Bowl. By the end of the game, people are too drunk or too tired to change the channel or even to turn the set off, so they sample a new show--and hopefully a hit is born. It worked for <i>The A-Team;</i> why not <i>The Wonder Years?</i></span></p> <p><span>In addition to seven regular commercials for the new family-oriented show during the game, ABC's sports announcers freely plugged the new show whenever they had a few extra seconds. The sappiest pitch was when Frank Gifford told us that his wife Kathie cried during their special screening of the show.</span></p> <p><span>Some might say that the final score of Super Bowl XXII was 42-10. But in reality, at $650,000 for a half-minute ad, ABC was the winner--raking in at least $33 million dollars from ads and attracting countless more million of viewers to the advertised shows.</span></p>"}

Then a front-runner is chosen by widespread media acclamation before even a single vote is cast. The remaining candidates are forced to campaign less against the favorite than against the polls which dominate the nominating procedures of both parties.</span></p> <p><span>The presidential preference poll, once a curious way of measuring public opinion, has in recent years become so essential to the electoral process that it now exerts a harmful influence upon how we choose our nation's leaders. Rather than reflecting public opinion, polls--by narrowing our choices--have begun to shape it.</span></p> <p><span>Months ago media pollsters declared the Republican race to be a contest between Vice President Bush and Senate minority leader Dole, pushing the lesserknown candidates out of the spotlight. Following former frontrunner Gary Hart's withdrawal last May, the Democratic race became a desperate search for a clear leader, extending even to non-candidates such as New York Governor Mario Cuomo. With none of the remaining seven candidates commanding a broad national following, they were soon referred to as \"The Seven Dwarfs.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he most obvious danger in the media's use of polls lies in the tendency to classify candidates into two tiers: the front-runners and the dark horses. Early in a campaign, the media categorizes certain candidates as electable because they are well-known or receive favorable ratings from early polling data. The remaining candidates are categorized as unelectable also-rans.</span></p> <p><span>Strategists at several \"second-tier\" campaigns claim that most media polls are limited and misleading. The surveys are targeted toward \"likely\" voters or caucus-goers--an unscientific designation based on party affiliation and previous voting history. According to Diane Weiland, press secretary to Rev. Jesse Jackson's campaign, \"A lot of people are new and will not have voted before and therefore won't show up on traditional polls.\" Jackson considers registering new voters an important objective in his campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of accurately depicting the course of a campaign, media polls merely register a snapshot of constantly fluctuating popularity. Media polls fail to gauge more important factors, such as the willingness of a supporter to switch to another candidate or the organizational strength of a campaign. The more cautious and probing surveys conducted by the campaigns themselves take into consideration these factors, which are often key to the voters' final decision.</span></p> <p><span>Katie Boyle, deputy press secretary for the Dole campaign, admits that their latest in-house poll shows as little as a 3 percent difference between the two candidates--although most Iowa polls show Dole to be enjoying a wide margin of support over Bush. Media polls in caucus states, she says, \"should all be taken with a grain of salt. They don't measure organization. Smart campaigns don't pay much attention to them.\"</span></p> <p><span>And commanding a clear lead in the media polls can carry as many disadvantages as benefits. A failure to meet high expectations means defeat even when a candidate has finished first. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis is expected to win handily in the neighboring New Hampshire primary, but nevertheless cannot risk a strong second place showing by any other candidate.</span></p> <p><span>In 1968 and 1972 the campaigns of underdogs Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern were given enormous boosts by their New Hampshire performances. Both candidates lost the primaries, but won the public relations battle when they finished better than expected. Walter Mondale won the Iowa caucuses by a large margin in 1984, but Gary Hart emerged instantly into the spotlight by beating the odds with a second place. Hart then became the media-appointed alternative to Mondale, shoving John Glenn, the previous number two candidate, out of the race.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>LTHOUGH campaigns would prefer to sit on the upper part of the polling spectrum, the campaign of former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt has found some strategic advantages at the bottom. Mike Muir, Babbitt's campaign manager for New Hampshire, claims his candidate has gained \"tremendous recognition\" speaking his mind on controversial issues since he does not have to worry about his place in the polls (mainly, because he barely has one), while other candidates are restricted by the fear of jeopardizing their rank. \"The governor's stand on the deficit has received more play simply because of the contrast offered by other candidates,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Media polling can play a positive role, however. It can show the effectiveness of a campaign's advertising or a candidate's thematic approaches, and it can sense how trends are developing throughout the course of a campaign. But in presenting the polls, the media, more often than not, clouds its insight into campaign issues with a barrage of hard numbers. Gerry Chervinsky of Cambridge-based KRC Research, a national polling organization, says, \"the way the media looks at polls is confusing. Comparing different polls up and down, day to day is nonsense.\"</span></p> <p><span>More crucial is the effect of polls on our roles in the electoral process. By relying on polls we sacrifice our most important right as voters--the right to choose the candidates. Excessive polling inevitably creates the illusion that certain candidates are electable while others are not. By election day, most candidates are not regarded as acceptable alternatives. Our votes are reduced to nothing more than a referendum on the popularity of front-runners chosen by the newspapers and television stations.</span></p> <p><span>Jesse Jackson, a victim of the electability debate, explains the problem: People need to move from saying \"Jackson is good, but he can't win,\" to saying \"Jackson is good, therefore he should win.\"</span></p>"}

With her first hubby. she tells us, it was a case of true love but then he was run over by a bus. The happy marriage having ended seven years earlier, Cher's character, Loretta, decides she needs the security of a new marriage. This, apparently, is how the modern woman acts.</span></p> <p><span>Johnny (Danny Aiello) has just proposed to her. Though she does not love him, she accepts. He is, well, a nice man. but he suffers from a strong Oedipal conflict. His mamma may live in Palermo, but her apron strings reach across the ocean to her favorite bambino.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>OW she is dying, and she summons her son to Sicilia for the occasion.

They consummate their love, and Loretta is left with feelings of guilt and indecision. The plot turn is easy to understand because the film goes out of its way to show Cage's brawn. And his brainlessness, even if he does love the opera.</span></p> <p><span>Cher decides to stick with marrying Johnny, and to resolve her guilt she goes to confessional. \"Pray for me, father, for I have sinned,\" she tells the priest, adding as casually as she might recite a shopping list that she has twice taken the Lord's name in vain, slept with the brother of her fiance, and once knocked someone over by accident. The priest simply tells her to say two rosaries.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T may be hard to imagine Cher as an Italian, but she manages to pull it off. She also proves capable of entering into the kind of family politics which large families require. And Loretta's family is stereotypically Italian, complete with a grandfather who gives the food his daughter-in-law cooks to his pack of dogs.</span></p> <p><span>Olympia Dukakis plays the mother (yes, she is related to the governor) as a said woman who asks the men she meets one important question, \"Why do men chase women?\" The answer, she concludes, is fear of death. Dukakis is made up to look much older than she is, and she acts as if she is miserable. Maybe she is, but this does not really fit in with the film's levity.</span></p> <p><span>Cher's father is Vincent Gardenia. Gardenia is one of the movie's highlights. Charming and reticent, he is a plumber with a gift for words. His own senile father, however is a bit too much of a stereotype.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HATEVER the plot's faults may be, the film is humorous--not on a cerebral level, but it strikes a primitive chord. And though the film attempts to create meaningful metaphors (the moon and the opera), even these turn out to be comical. But it is hard to believe that 38-year-old Italian-speaking Loretta has never been to the opera before she meets Ronny and equally hard to believe that she is so touched by it (the tears positively roll down her face). The question remains--is this intended to be funny?</span></p> <p><span><i>Moonstruck's</i> tale of tangled love triangles (Cher's is not the only one) can be highly entertaining, despite a cast of mediocre actors.

Michael S. Dukakis never \"provided more than lip-service support for education.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"In the field of education--as in that of economic development--Michael Dukakis claims credit for accomplishments that others have brought about,\" Robert C. Wood wrote in his letter, which was sent to educators in Massachusetts and Connecticut. \"It is the Massachusetts legislature that has fought to preserve fiscal and institutional autonomy for higher education, not the Governor,\" he added.</span></p> <p><span>Wood was president of the UMass system from 1970 to 1978, and he worked with Dukakis during the governor's first term in office.</span></p> <p><span>Wood, who now teaches at Wesleyan University, said yesterday that he wrote the letter because other professors asked him about Dukakis's record in higher education.</span></p> <p><span>\"They had been under the impression that he had been in the forefront of higher education,\" said Wood. \"That impression was factually wrong.\"</span></p> <p><span>Robert B.

He said part of the three-and-a-half-page letter included research he had done this year that showed the legislature had been far more supportive of higher education than the governor.</span></p> <p><span>\"The governor had to sign the bill,\" said Hoy. \"If he had not supported all improvements, they would not have been instated.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Oswald Tippo, former chancellor and provost of UMASS/Amherst, said he believed the letter to be accurate. \"Dukakis has a wretched record as far as public institutions are concerned,\" he said.

{"title": "An Appropriate Veto | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>n a campaign season haunted by the specter of billion-dollar deficits, many presidential candidates are being forced to respond to questions about how they would balance the federal budget. Since announcing a plan to raise taxes would be a political kiss of death, the candidates are looking for less painful alternatives.</span></p> <p><span>One of the most popular plans for balancing the budget without using the dreaded T-word is the passage of a constitutional amendment granting the president line item veto authority. With this power, the chief executive would be able to veto single appropriations in a spending bill which he deems wasteful and unnecessary without wiping out the entire bill.</span></p> <p><span>So far, several candidates, including Vice President George Bush, Sen. Robert Dole (R.-Kas.), and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis have joined with President Reagan in favoring use of the line item veto to reduce the deficit. Bush has even included the item veto in one of his campaign commercials, saying that \"Congress is against the line item veto. That means it's probably a pretty good idea.\"</span></p> <p><span>While the majority of Congressmen are opposed to the line item veto, there are a few, including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D.-Mass.) and Sen. Joe Biden (D.-Del.), who feel that the authority is a legitimate way to reduce the deficit.</span></p> <p><span>Although the power has never been granted to the president, the item veto is commonly used in the United States. Forty-three states give governors item veto authority, and Congress has, in the past, granted the authority to the governors of many American overseas territories.</span></p> <p><span>The logic behind a line item veto is simple. By putting the entire federal budget into a single omnibus spending package, which the president must ratify in its entirety or veto (thereby shutting down the complete federal bureaucracy), legislators can insert a number of pork-barrel expenditures to please their constituents and improve their re-election chances. That is simply the nature of the legislative beast.</span></p> <p><span>The pork-barrel expenditures included in the last omnibus spending bill, signed just before winter recess, range from the slightly humorous--$240,000 for a study of the damage done to macademia nuts by rats--to the seriously expensive--$25 million for an unneeded new airport in Fort Worth near the home territory Speaker of the House Jim Wright. In the several-thousand pages of an omnibus appropriations bill, these expenditures can be shielded from constituents, and congressmen can hide their support for these perks by claiming that they voted for the whole package, not individual appropriations.</span></p> <p><span>If the president exercised item veto power, it is unlikely that legislators would override the veto and openly support such ridiculous expenditures on their own.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>hile a line item veto may work on the state level, it is highly unlikely that a president would ever get to use it on the federal level. Constitutional amendments are extremely rare, and there is far from a consensus in support of the item veto.</span></p> <p><span>Opponents of the authority fear that it would be an unnecessary expansion of presidential power. A president with the power to veto individual appropriations could slash his opponents' favorite programs and leave intact his supporters' plans. Fearing for their re-election chances, legislators could become completely subservient to the executive.</span></p> <p><span>And there is no guarantee that the veto would actually reduce spending. If a president wanted a program badly enough, he could blackmail congressional leaders into supporting him by threatening to veto their pet bills. The budget would then include the president's agenda as well as the Congress's.</span></p> <p><span>Since the president is already granted a general veto power by the Constitution, the item veto is unnecessary. With the authority he already has, a shrewd president can expose legislative big spenders and cut out the fat on spending bills--without completely realigning the relationship between the executive and legislative branches.</span></p> <p><span>If an omnibus appropriations package is too wasteful, the president can pick out the most superfluous expenditures and veto the entire bill because of them. Then he could promise to sign the same bill into law, as long as the offensive appropriations were excluded.</span></p> <p><span>Framing the debate in this way, the president could force Congress into the court of public opinion. With a two-thirds majority, Congress could override his veto and pass the original appropriations bill, which would appear to the public as sanctioning wasteful spending. Or they could accept his veto and pass the same bill without those expenditures, as the president had proposed.</span></p> <p><span>Although Congress could override president's veto if his demands were unfair, it is unlikely that two-thirds of Congress would be willing to vote for a package that appeared wasteful unless they could justify all of the expenditures. Threatened with a shut-down of the government because no funds had been appropriated, Congress would have to pass the bill the president wanted.</span></p> <p><span>For all of Reagan's rhetoric about how Congress has stuffed omnibus spending packages--charges that often ring true--the president has signed the giant omnibus packages and vetoed only a handful of smaller appropriations bills. The result has been enormous budget deficits.</span></p> <p><span>Because Reagan has not used his general veto power effectively, the next president will have to.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Republicans Sing Caucus Blues | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>M</b>ORE than anything else, Iowa 1988 will be remembered as the beginning of the end for the Republican Party's chances of capturing the White House in 1988. Former television evangelist Marion \"Pat\" Robertson's startling second place finish in the caucuses on Monday night has destroyed the party's chances of ever again attracting the voters who gave Reagan his landslide victories.</span></p> <p><span>Caucus winner Senator Robert Dole and Vice President George Bush had thought 1988 would be a two-man race. But Robertson's Iowa result boosts him into the front of the pack by demonstrating that his victories in Michigan and Hawaii were not mere flukes.</span></p> <p><span>Bush, who trailed Robertson by 6 percent in a weak third place, will not be the only one to suffer from Robertson's strong showing. Dole will now have to square off with a candidate who commands the loyalty of zealous extremists from the Republican far Right.</span></p> <p><span>Dole or Bush may be able to soothe the fears of some moderate Republicans, but the influence of Robertson's extremist disciples in the party will be undeniable. If his luck continues, Robertson could emerge from the primary season controlling a sizeable portion of the convention delegates, poised to shape the Republican platform. In the last two elections independents and defectors from the Democratic party, mesmerized by Reagan's charisma, chose to ignore the Republican Party's beholdenness to the far Right; this time they won't have that chance.</span></p> <p><span>Robertson's surge badly embarassed the Vice President, but has by no means knocked Bush out of the race. The Bush campaign has stockpiled the most campaign funds of any Republican in the race and has pledged to stay in the campaign for the long haul. Bush, who owns a home in Maine, remains competitive in neighboring New Hampshire and has been dominating the polls there by a wide margin. A strong rebound for him in next Tuesday's primary could be viewed by voters as evidence of his resilience.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>n the Democratic caucuses, what did not happen was more noteworthy than what did. No candidate scored a knockout blow, since first place finisher Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) won by only 4 percent. The failure of any candidate to separate himself from the pack signals that the race may go all the way to the convention.</span></p> <p><span>Another significant event that failed to liven up the caucuses was a victory by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, which would have defined the Easterner as a viable national candidate. Added to a win a week later in New Hampshire, where Dukakis is widely viewed as the odds-on favorite, an Iowa victory would have catapulted him into the South as the Democratic frontrunner.</span></p> <p><span>Dukakis' grasp on 21 percent of the Iowa vote may come to be viewed as proof that he is not merely a regional candidate--if his campaign can put enough spin on the results. In addition to leading in the East, Dukakis at times vied for the lead in Iowa with the Midwestern candidates, Gephardt and Sen. Paul Simon (D.-III.). A month ago, however, instead of waging a full scale campaign in a caucus vote he might not have won, Dukakis started to portray the vote as a mere prelude to New Hampshire. His campaign billed the winner of Iowa to be a mere challenger to Dukakis in New Hampshire. By lowering expectations for Iowa, Dukakis neutralized the potential damage of a third-place finish.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>NOTHER potential disruption to the race that did not occur in Iowa was Gephardt's elimination--which would have resulted from anything short of victory. Down in the polls as recently as two months ago, Gephardt concentrated his national staff in Iowa and unleashed a blitz of new commercials portraying him as an anti-establishment populist. A win was absolutely essential for the congressman, who had campaigned strenuously in Iowa for nearly two years.</span></p> <p><span>Gephardt's risk has paid off. An Iowa victory gives him a tremendous boost in national media attention. However, his populist image, responsible for his campaign's rejuvenation, may prove unsaleable in New Hampshire. Calls for protectionism and an oil import fee may be popular among the disgruntled residents of the depressed Midwest, but they won't fly with New Hampshire voters.</span></p> <p><span>Had Simon won in Iowa, the race may have become the two-man contest--between him and Dukakis--that it promised to be before Hart's return in the fall. Enjoying a much stronger organization in New Hampshire than Gephardt, Simon looks to do well in next week's primary. An Iowa victory and the attendant media exposure would have enabled him to run an even stronger challenge in New Hampshire, where a narrow loss to Dukakis would be a triumph. Coupled with an Iowa win, this would have provided Simon with front-runner status going into Super Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span>A result from Iowa that may not receive as much press as it deserves is Rev. Jesse Jackson's hold on more than 10 percent of the vote. In a state where only I percent of the population is Black, this result proves Jackson is a more broadly-based candidate than some observers believe.</span></p> <p><span>But the Iowa result that deserves the most attention come November is the strong showing of the other Reverend-turned-candidate. Robertson's second-place finish discloses the Republicans' Achilles heel. Should Robertson continue to pick up delegates and turn off moderates, it will not matter which Democrat opposes the Republicans in November. Even godless Gary Hart, with 0 percent of the Iowa vote, would have a shot.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Iowa Separates the Wheat From the Chaff | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE dust has settled and once again, the voters of Iowa have made their mark on American history.</span></p> <p><span>But before the ink had dried on the final tallies of yesterday's vote, Americans--from voter action groups to political science classes--had voiced their contempt and outrage for the Iowa caucus.</span></p> <p><span>No doubt, many of the criticism of the present nomination system have their merits. On the surface, it seems illogical for such a small population--about 220,000 participating voters in a state with 3 million residents--so apparently unrepresentative of the national constituency--to have such a large impact on the nominating process. To make the contest a caucus, in which \"horse-trading\" and political bargaining can obscure public opinion, seems even more nonsensical.</span></p> <p><span>Frustrated with the power this \"negligible\" state has wielded in the past, critics have suggested a slew of reforms, from a national primary to a rotating system of state primaries. With each election year, the people, so convinced of the inadequacies of the Iowa system, seem ever closer to accepting these changes.</span></p> <p><span>But before Americans condemn Iowa and its caucus, they should take a closer look at this week's results. While the final vote had its share of surprises, there is no reason to believe that the Iowa caucuses have single-handedly selected the next Democratic and Republican nominees.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, the caucuses gave definition and interest to a race seriously lacking in either. The Republican voters focused the race on three men--Vice President Bush, Sen. Robert Dole (R.-Kan.), and former evangelist Marion \"Pat\" Robertson. By demonstrating that the rest of the pack couldn't gather many delegates, the Iowa caucus at least condensed the crowd to the candidates with the greatest popular support.</span></p> <p><span>Iowan Democrats also did their part to trim the nomination race down to a more reasonable size. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Rep. Richard Gephardt (D.-Mo.), and Sen. Paul Simon (D.-III.) came out as frontrunners. With a commendable fourth-place showing, Rev. Jesse Jackson proved once and for all that his appeal was not limited to Blacks. Meanwhile, the caucus-goers effectively eliminated two men whose presence only obscured the Democratic field, former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt and former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart. Thanks to the Iowans, the Democratic party can now sport a few candidates who have received someone's stamp of approval besides Snow White's.</span></p> <p><span>This year's caucus shows the importance of an initial testing ground for the candidates, and Iowa is as good a state as any to sponsor this test. A majority of Iowa's population lives in cities, and the per capita income is close to the national average. Over the years, the Iowans have shown themselves to be a people very serious and conscientious about their politics.</span></p> <p><span>With Iowa to take the first step on the campaign road, the rest of America can watch a very informed electorate size up the issues and candidates, without committing an overwhelming amount of delegates--there are only 52 Democratic delegates in Iowa. Were it not for Iowa, Democratic voters would still be floundering with seven indistinguishable candidates. Likewise, the Republican caucus-goers showed the nation that Pat Robertson is a serious candidate--and threat--with a legitimate base of support.</span></p> <p><span>Arguments that the caucus results too rigidly constrain national debate are unfounded. The caucus may trim the fat but it certainly doesn't cut back the beef--indications this year are that all three of the top Democratic runners will maintain momentum for some time to come. With Bush still leading the polls in New Hampshire, Dole's glory ride could be short-lived. Virtually no political experts interviewed by the press would dare make predictions based solely on this week's results.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>F indeed there is a problem with the nomination process, it is not with the Iowa caucus itself. Rather, most of the alleged drawbacks can be traced to the irresponsibility the media. Jimmy Carter's surge of momentum following the 1976 caucus was not the result of a smashing victory; he only beat the closest runner-up by 5 percent. Carter became a force when the media completely refocused on him--and ignored the rest of the pack. In national politics, perception is as important as fact. And in this and many other cases the media created an inaccurate perception.</span></p> <p><span>This year the intensified coverage of Iowa, by both national and local correspondents, let the rest of the nation take Iowa for what it is--the first step in a long nomination process.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Making Music: Undergraduate Bands | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last week, the crowd at Cambridge's Catch A Rising Star learned what the the Harvard Community already knows--the University's rock music scene is alive and well.</span></p> <p><span>Men of Clay, a band made up of three Harvard undergraduates, performed last Wedenesday at the club before a sellout crowd of 150 people. During its set, the band played a cover version of the U2 hit \"With or Without You\" and a new Sting tune called \"Rock Steady.\" The group also showed off some of its original melodies, including \"Deep Blue Glow.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Rising Star engagement was \"very successful,\" says Benjamin M. Hammond '89, the bassist for Men of Clay. \"People off to the side were dancing. [The performance] felt good because people were listening really hard,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Although Men of Clay was the only Harvard band at Rising Star that night, it is far from the only band at the University. While Men of Clay features a fusion jazz sound, Christian and the Infidels say they play \"strictly rock and roll.\" The Rhythm Method concentrates on pure pop music.</span></p> <p><span>Most undergraduate bands get their start playing on campus at house committee parties. The busiest times for bands on campus include Halloween, Valentine's Day and Head of the Charles weekend, says Nevin D. Steinberg '89, who plays bass for Christian and the Infidels.</span></p> <p><span>\"Playing for the students here is my favorite part of being in a band because the audiences are really receptive,\" Steinberg says.</span></p> <p><span>Once bands become better known, they begin playing off campus and can pick and chose among the on-campus parties. When selecting their gigs, the Infidels place great importance on what organization sponsors the event and who is acting as the event's organizer, Steinberg says.</span></p> <p><span>\"You have to be careful about the organizers of an event,\" Steinberg says. \"You have to make sure they have their act together in terms of advertising and other stuff so that you can just do your job. \"The group will be playing at Lowell House on Saturday.</span></p> <p><span>When playing on campus, the bands tend to play cover tunes--songs made famous by other groups--because students are more interested in hearing music that they know, band members say. \"It's tough, because Harvard students don't want to hear original music,\" says Michael R. Greenspan '88, who plays with Christian and the Infidels.</span></p> <p><span>Says Lowell House committee chairman Megan K. Jenks '89, \"We usually hire Christian and the Infidels because they play covers with a few originals.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Rhythm Method does not cover the music of other artists, preferring to play original tunes and their own versions of other groups' songs, says lead singer John N. Axelrod '88. \"We perform covers in the same way that Van Halen does Roy Orbison.\" As a result, The Rhythm Method generally does not play at Harvard functions.</span></p> <p><span>By contrast, The Quick, a recently defunct campus band, attempted to capitalize on undergraduate music tastes by playing only established hits. The group was founded this fall by members of Men of Clay, because a number of popular dance groups had recently disbanded, and many student organizations were looking for new bands to play cover tunes at their functions.</span></p> <p><span><b>Sources of Inspiration</b></span></p> <p><span>The student bands may not get to play very much of their original music on campus, but even so, they spend a lot of time writing and practicing it.</span></p> <p><span>Axelrod says he usually comes up with an idea for a song and presents it to the other two members of The Rhythm Method. The three of them work together on arranging the tune to fit each member of the band in the best way, he says. When writing music, Axelrod says, \"We are a triangular nucleus. We are each interdependent on each other. You have to be selfless rather than selfish.\"</span></p> <p><span>By contrast, the Infidels' original melodies are usually penned by Christian Kanuth '87 and jointly arranged by all the band members, Steinberg says. During the arranging process, \"Bass players are important because they keep a piece of music under control,\" adds Steinberg, who plays bass.</span></p> <p><span>Inspiration comes in a variety of ways, the student composers say. Axelrod says he most often gets ideas for songs when travelling between classes. \"I don't need a piano to write music on,\" he says. However, \"Sometimes when you get to a piano it doesn't sound anything like what you thought it would because when you write a song you hear all the parts in your head and the piano is only one instrument,\" Axelrod adds.</span></p> <p><span>Themes for his songs include: the nuclear arms freeze, the importance of individuality and the disappearance of the institution of love in the modern world. \"In order to write a good song it is necessary to take a personal experience that is seen as universal,\" Axelrod says.</span></p> <p><span>Axelrod and the rest of the band says they are adamant in their resolve not to compromise their originality in any way. The band strives to bring something new and interesting to the traditional \"Top 40 radio\" sound. \"Some people write songs according to the formulas followed by leading pop songs of today,\" says Axelrod, adding that these people write only to please the commercial market and make money.</span></p> <p><span>\"We're not in it for the money. We want to make really good music and get it out to as many people as possible,\" Axelrod says.</span></p> <p><span>Playing in club gives the artists a chance to show off their own music and, of course, make a little money. The Infidels get $1000 for an off-campus performance and only $850 for on-campus shows, says Andrew E. Bush '88. However, Men of Clay earns $750 for performances both on and off campus, Ben Hammond says. Similarly, The Rhythm Method received $800 when they played last week at New York's China Club, Axelrod says. The money does not go all that far, band members say, because they have to pay about $300 a show for sound equipment.</span></p> <p><span><b>Finding a Home</b></span></p> <p><span>Band members work hard for their money. All of the groups practice several times a week and finding rehearsal space can often be a problem. Dunster House has a large basement practice room, but few other houses are similarly equipped. The Rhythm Method has solved the dilemma by practicing twice a week in a rented rehearsal space in Boston, Axelrod says.</span></p> <p><span>Axelrod says his group has tried to remedy the problem. The Rhythm Method recently won $5000 in the national Energizer Battle of the Bands contest and offered the prize money to Harvard to pay for a rehearsal studio. But Assistant Dean for Physical Resources Phillip J. Parsons rejected their proposal because he did not consider rehearsal space for bands a priority. The Rhythm Method is still bargaining with the administration for a space here on campus, Axelrod says.</span></p> <p><span><b>Getting Started</b></span></p> <p><span>Undergraduates at Harvard tend to meet people accidentally, and band members are no exception. Kanuth found the original members of the Infidels in 1984 by asking the people he met if they liked music, band members say. And Axelrod says The Rhythm Method's current composition is almost accidental. At first, The Rhythm Method was composed only of Harvard students, but it temporarily disbanded when three of the original four members graduated.</span></p> <p><span>Since then Axelrod says he has performed with a number of different musicians and has \"had to ask a few players to leave.\" Although the members of a band are like brothers, sometimes members are unable to either make the full time commitment or \"cut it musically,\" Axelrod says. \"A certain level of professionalism must be kept,\" he says. Axelrod finally hit on a winning combination with two undergraduates at the Berkelee School of Music--saxophonist Warren Hill and Percussionist David Schommer.</span></p> <p><span>When the group plays live, its \"nucleus\" is supplemented by studio musicians from the Berk-lee School of Music. These musicians add the bass guitar, a horn section and keyboards to the Rythym Method's music.</span></p> <p><span>Ben Hammond left Christian and the Infidels about a year-and-a-half ago to form Men of Clay when his brother Tom came to Harvard. \"I knew that if Tom came here we would form a band together. We had been playing together since high school,\" says Ben Hammond. Shankar Ramaswami '89, Ben Hammond's squash partner at Harvard, completed the trio when they discovered that they shared the same musical tastes and felt influenced by the Police and the Beatles.</span></p> <p><span>Although the music scene is quite busy, it may be becoming more difficult for Harvard bands to get started.</span></p> <p><span>The College recently instituted a stricter alcohol policy, and attendance at large house committee-sponsored parties has shrunk. The Men of Clay and the Infidels already play at the most popular functions on campus. Since attendance was poor at The Quick's few on-campus shows, the group decided to disband this winter. \"The alcohol policy killed the party scene here at Harvard,\" Ben Hammond says.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Noriega Provided Training For Contras | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>WASHINGTON--Panama's military leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, provided military training for U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels after he met twice in 1985 with Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, a former top Panamanian intelligence official testified yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>North told Noriega in October 1985 that the Panamanian training bases were needed because U.S. laws at the time banned any direct U.S. help for the rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist government, Jose I. Blandon said through an interpreter.</span></p> <p><span>The testimony came as U.S.-Panamanian allegations have continued to worsen after formal allegations that Noriega was deeply involved in illicit drug smuggling.</span></p> <p><span>Blandon, who was fired last month by Noriega as Panama's consul general in New York, also told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that Vice President George Bush used Noriega to send a warning to Cuban leader Fidel Castro hours before the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983.</span></p> <p><span>Bush, who was asked at the White House if he ever called Noriega, replied, \"Nunca--Never.\" \"Nunca\" is the Spanish word for never.</span></p> <p><span>Blandon, testifying under oath for a second day, also repeated his assertion that the CIA regularly sent Noriega reports on the political positions and personal lives of some U.S. senators, including Sens. Jesse Helms (R.N.C.) and Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass).</span></p> <p><span>The CIA \"categorically denied\" Blandon's statements on Tuesday, but he yesterday refused to change his story.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is no reason in my heart and in my mind to invalidate what I have said,\" he told the subcommittee on terrorism. \"Unfortunately, what I said is true.\"</span></p> <p><span>Late yesterday, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee issued a statement saying he doubted Blandon's allegation on the CIA reports.</span></p> <p><span>\"Based on information previously given to me, I have no reason to believe that there is any truth to the allegation in regard to the improper furnishing of information to Noriega,\" Sen. David Boren (D-Okla), said.</span></p> <p><span>In testimony before the subcommittee yesterday afternoon, a Panamanian pilot, his features hidden by a black hood, said Noriega contracted in 1982 with Colombia's Medellin narcotics cartel to protect cocaine shipments flown into Panama en route to the United States. The cartel is said to be responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine imported into the United States.</span></p> <p><span>The pilot, 38-year-old Floyd Carlton, also said Noriega personally authorized air shipments of weapons to leftist guerillas in El Salvador and to Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua during the Sandinistas' successful fight to overthrow the government of Anastasio Somoza.</span></p> <p><span>\"We did nothing without his approval,\" Carlton said of Noriega.</span></p> <p><span>In the morning session, Blandon testified that Noriega's first meeting with North, a former National Security Council aide, occurred in June 1985 on a yacht near the Panamanian city of Balboa. The second meeting was at Noriega's office four months later.</span></p> <p><span>Blandon said North sought Panamanian training bases for the Contras because North told Noriega that U.S. laws banned any direct American support for the guerrillas.</span></p> <p><span>Noriega agreed, Blandon said, and the guerrillas were trained at two Panamanian bases.</span></p> <p><span>Noriega later offered to send Panamanian soldiers inside Nicaragua to conduct \"terrorist sabotage\" against the Sandinistas, Blandon said. North answered that he had no authority to accept such an offer but would relay it to his bosses at the National Security Council.</span></p> <p><span>Blandon didn't indicate if Noriega's plan was ever put into effect.</span></p> <p><span>Noriega didn't make any specific request for a return favor, Blandon said. But he later renewed his assertion that Noriega headed a \"criminal empire\" that dealt in drugs with the knowledge of U.S. officials.</span></p> <p><span>Both North and his former boss at the National Security Council, Rear Adm. John Poindexter, are targets of an investigation by the independent counsel in the Iran-Contra affair.</span></p> <p><span>Blandon told the Foreign Relations panel that Noriega met in December, 1985 in Panama with Poindexter, who had just taken over as President Reagan's national security adviser.</span></p> <p><span>Noriega asserted last week that Poindexter talked at that meeting about plans for a U.S. invasion of Nicaragua, but Blandon disputed that. No such plans were discussed, he said.</span></p> <p><span>The Bush warning was passed to Castro two or three hours before the Oct. 25, 1983, invasion of the Caribbean island nation, Blandon said.</span></p> <p><span>He explained that Bush's office called him and asked him to relay the message to Castro through Noriega. Castro later called Noriega and received the warning, Blandon said.</span></p>"}
