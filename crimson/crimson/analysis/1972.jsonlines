{"title": "Void In Spades-II | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>ITH THE EXCEPTION of '56--when Eisenhower was mistakenly credited for the Supreme Court decision on integration in '54--the bulk of the black vote has been reliably Democratic since the New Deal.</span></p> <p><span>The Democratic Presidents, in turn, have also made efforts to respond to aspects of the condition of blacks in America.  Some of these efforts have been purely political in motivation and equally useless in effect, others have grown out of a President's personal or legal convictions and have been significantly more valuable.</span></p> <p><span>The relationship between the national Democratic leadership and the black vote has produced a number of mutually profitable cooperative actions including the defeat of Richard Nixon in 1960.</span></p> <p><span><b>II</b></span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE KEY to the Kennedy victory (or the Nixon defeat) and the black role in it was a telephone call made by Kennedy to Correta King after her husband had been sentenced by a DeKalb County, Georgia judge to four months of hard labor \"in the closest thing possible to a Georgia chain gang\" for driving with an out-of-state license.</span></p> <p><span>Few blacks expected that King would emerge in recognizable form after doing four months, and many doubted that he would emerge at all.  The Kennedy phone call served notice that he and whatever political power he represented would not permit King to be led down the traditional way of all black flesh caught in the joint of the Georgia cracker.</span></p> <p><span>The phone call also served another purpose.  As Theodore White wrote in <i>The Making of the President, 1960:</i></span></p> <p><span><i>The father of Martin Luther King, a Baptist minister himself who had come out for Nixon a few weeks earlier...now switched.  \"Because this man,\" said the Reverend Mr. King Senior, \"was willing to wipe the tears from my daughter</i> (in-law's) <i>eyes.  I've got a suitcase of votes, and I'm going to take them to Mr. Kennedy and dump them in his lap.\"... When one reflects that Illinois was carried by only 9,000 votes and that 250,000 Negroes voted for Kennedy, that South Carolina was carried by 10,000 votes and that an estimated 40,000 Negroes voted for Kennedy, the candidate's instinctive decision must be ranked among the most crucial</i> (of the campaign).</span></p> <p><span>Although Republicans argued at the time that Kennedy's decision to call Corretta King was prompted by a Machiavellian as opposed to a humanitarian instinct, Nixon's decision not to contact the Kings or express any concern was no less political.  As White observed:</span></p> <p><span><i>Either President Eisenhower or Vice President Nixon could have acted (by issuing the statement supporting the release of King that had been drawn up by the Justice Department the afternoon of King's sentencing)--yet neither did.  However obscure Eisenhower's motivations were, Nixon's are even more perplexing, for he was the candidate.  He had made the political decision at Chicago to court the Negro vote in the North:  only now, apparently, he felt it quite possible that Texas, South Carolina, and Louisiana might well be won to him by the white vote and he did not wish to offend that vote.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>III</b></span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>O BEGAN the Southern Strategy.  A long time coming to the Republican party, it appeared as if it might be a long time gone when, after its initial failure in 1960, a modified version was far more successful in '68.  The full development and deployment of the Agnew Backlash Missile system in '69 and early '70 seemed to promise even better results.</span></p> <p><span>Yet the defeats of the Haynsworth and Carswell nominations prefigured one of the more subtle lessons of the past two national elections that Richard Nixon is obviously pondering as he looks forward to November.</span></p> <p><span>Briefly, that lesson is that Nixon's political hand is too weak over-all for him to enter the upcoming campaign with an absolute void in Spades.</span></p> <p><span>In electing a President, the black vote is simply too pivotal for either party to ignore.  Although, according to the Census, blacks compose only about 10 to 11 per cent of the population and accounted for only 8 per cent of the total vote cast in '68, one out of every five votes Humphrey received in '68 was a black vote, and 12 per cent of Nixon's total were votes by blacks.</span></p> <p><span>Thus, blacks exercised a leverage that is 50 per cent more than their voting numbers alone would imply.</span></p> <p><span>Much of this leverage arises from the fact that the black vote has never been diverted by third party movements.  This lack of interest in political long-shots stems from the general understanding by black people in all parts of the country that American electoral politics is the ritual in which it is decided who will say who will get what.</span></p> <p><span>This appreciation of the pie-cutting process can only have been heightened by the past decade of government Poverty Programs and ghetto groups mau-mauing the flack catchers.  20 years ago when such programs were not in existence, civil rights was a soft issue.  Blacks evaluated a political aspirant according to the philosophic sympathy he showed to \"the cause\", his sensitivity to \"the movement\" as shown by his public appearances and statements.  Federal money was not available, and nobody was expecting any anytime soon.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy and Johnson changed that--Kennedy by raising expectations of government support, and Johnson by moving towards fulfilling them.  Regardless of how successfully they have dealt with the actual problems, the Model Cities, Head Starts and Job Corps of the New Frontier and the Great Society have irrevocably made what used to be called civil rights into the hard issue of black power.</span></p> <p><span>Recognizing that he can't go home again, Nixon, like any good political poker player, seems to be sloughing off a questionable card--Agnew--and going back to the deck in hope of drawing the crucial strength in Spades that would allow him to make an easy inside straight back to the White House for another term of wheeling and dealing--Power.</span></p> <p><span><b>IV</b></span></p> <p><span><b>D</b>EMOCRATIC FRONT-RUNNER Edmund Muskie provided Poor Richard with a clue to where he might look to pick up the needed black support when Muskie said that he would not under any circumstances run on a ticket with a black Vice-Presidential candidate because \"if a black man were on the ticket, we would both lose.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nixon responded to this by labeling Muskie's statement \"a libel on the American conscience.\"  Then with the pot-luck inspiration of the truly smart poker player, Citizen Richard re-inforced his statement by adding that he even had a specific black in mind who he felt would be an asset to any national ticket:  Senator Edward Brooke of Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span><b>V</b></span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE DOOR to the inner office of suite 427 in the Old Senate Building opened.  Brooke, dressed in a black three-piece suit, greeted me, and after apologizing for the further delay of our conversation, hurried over to the Senate to cast a vote.</span></p> <p><span>As a result of an illness incurred while making the Commencement circuit last spring and, to a lesser degree, a first-term Senator's need to make a large number of public appearances in his home state, Brooke's voting record for 1971 fell below 80 per cent.  Like most Senators, Brooke feels that the law of diminishing return applies, and that it is counter-productive to abandon other activities in order to vote on more than 90 per cent of Senate business.  However, with key Senate liberals like Fred Harris of Oklahoma answering only 44 per cent of the roll calls and George McGovern only 59 per cent of the votes during the first nine months of '71, the probability that liberal absenteeism will increase during Presidential primaries and campaigns, and the number and complexity of Massachusetts problems that require Congressional action, Brooke feels that it is critical he make as many votes as possible.</span></p> <p><span>Although Brooke has missed many roll calls, he has made his votes count.  Americans for Democratic Action, which issues ratings on Congressional voting records, ranked Brooke higher than most Democratic liberals--including Ted Kennedy--approving of 88 per cent of his roll call stands.</span></p> <p><span>Yet what may be even more important about Brooke's position in the Senate than how he has used his own vote is his ability to influence other Senators.  This was the key to the defeats of Haynsworth and Carswell.</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of the fact that Brooke himself disclaims being black America's delegate to the United States Senate, his fellow Senators, particularly those like Percy of Illinois and Javits of New York who affect liberal images and depend upon black support at home for their continued tenure, understand how much damage a blast from Brooke could do to their political careers.  In probability, a strong personal condemnation from the man that Nixon is said to consider \"a responsible moderate\" would cost the Hartkes, Hatfields and Percys not only the black vote but a substantial amount of liberal white support as well.</span></p> <p><span>But, in the long run, the most universally valuable thing Brooke is doing is serving on the Senate Appropriations Committee, for that is the group that slices the American pie of power and says who gets what.</span></p> <p><span><b>VI</b></span></p> <p><span><b>J</b>ESSE JACKSON, the charismatic \"country preacher\" who built SCLC's Operation Breadbasket and was until recently its Director, understands the importance of Brooke's position on Appropriations.</span></p> <p><span>The day before I met with Brooke, Jackson was in the Old Senate Office Building suite talking with Brooke, Jackson, whose break with Abernathy and the rest of SCLC's Atlanta contingent specifically revolved around Jackson's independent production of the highly successful \"Black Expo\" in Chicago, understands the economic roots of the problems of blacks in America and throughout the Third World.  Although his famous Saturday morning meetings at Breadbasket ran on his personal electricity and drew much of their appeal from his \"I am Somebody\" exhortations, their real goal was to sensitize blacks to economic issues and enlist foot-soldiers for the economic wars of attrition Jackson successfully waged against Red Rooster chain stores and other large commercial vipers in Chicago's black community.</span></p> <p><span>When Brooke returned from the Senate chamber, he spoke of his meeting with Jackson the day before as the kind of session that occurs between independently powerful men and-or women who have a good complete understanding.  Clearly, the two men disagree on some issues, particularly specific aspects of foreign policy, but the foundation of their fundamental accord is rooted in the bedrock of their agreement on two basic points.</span></p> <p><span>The first point is that black people must get a larger share of the American pie, and that to do this, they must sophisticate internal political activity and make shrewd and well-defined alliances with various parts of the splintered white political configuration.  As William Clay of the Black Caucus puts it, \"We have no permanent friends and no permanent enemies.  Just permanent interests.\"</span></p> <p><span>Such a system of finite and flexible couplings has already resulted in several peculiarly striking arrangements, such as the alliance between blacks and Birchers in Southern California to fight for community controlled public education.  It has also produced the suggestion or the illusion of several other couplings, the most prominent of which has been the recent relationship between Brooke and Nixon.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>IXON'S STATEMENT that he considered the man who had been largely responsible for the Administration's two major domestic embarrassments as an asset to any political ticket dispatched several platoons of media men to find out if Brooke would run if Nixon offered him the Vice-Presidency.</span></p> <p><span>Brooke played it coy.  \"As a Republican, I would be honored\" by the offer, he told the press after a speech in Lynn.  This statement was immediately interpreted to mean that Brooke would accept the nomination.<jtp>\n</jtp></span></p>"}
{"title": "Harriers Face Two Today | Sports | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Today's cross country meet has taken on added meaning with the release yesterday of a poll of New England coaches on the question of who's who in New England running.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson harriers meet UMass and Providence today at Franklin field, at 4 p.m.  The coaches from the six-state area rank the Prices No. 2, behind Northeastern and ahead of Harvard, which is ranked third.  To make matters more interesting still, the University of Massachusetts is rated fourth.</span></p> <p><span>The poll was taken by the University of Connecticut Sports Information Bureau before team training camps opened, so it does not reflect Harvard's victory over Northeastern last week.</span></p> <p><span>The Redmen from Amherst shouldn't give Harvard too much of a tussie this year.  Last year, they finished behind both Harvard and Providence.  Massachusetts has a young team, staffed primarily by sophomores.</span></p> <p><span>Lead Redmen is co-captain Douglas O'Connell, who is in the 9 min.-2 category.  Sophomore Bill Glillen is also expected to turn in a strong performance.  He was the leader of the freshman group last year which defeated Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Providence is another story and appears to be the team to best.  They lost to Harvard last year, running strongly, and went on to win the New England Intercollegiate Championship at both varsity and J.V. levels.  Moreover, the Friars' frosh belted the Harvard freshmen last year.</span></p> <p><span>Providence's top mall.  Bill Speck, graduated last year, but number two man Tom Smith is back, as are junior Dennis Swart and sophomore Mike Koster.

{"title": "D.C. Machismo | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>N</b>EWSPAPER COLUMNISTS LIKE to think that they are important.  So do corporation executives, government officials, college professors and students, and most everyone else.  But unlike most people, columnists have to convince thousands of readers whom they have never met and over whom they exert no real power, that they are worth listening to.  Maintaining this posture of authority and importance is often quite a strain, and produces such unusual prose as Jack Anderson's political lexicon of tzars, bosses, hitmen, and the like.</span></p> <p><span>Occasionally, columnists graduate from the simple absurdity of their self-important prose and enter the realm of transcendent absurdity.  Such a columnist is Joseph Alsop, prophet of the Imminent American Victory in Vietnam, and a man who has devoted his mature life to the pursuit of chimerical creatures.  Nothing in American letters is so tragically commonplace as such a columnist--from whom the oracular grace has so obviously been withdrawn, who has been wrong so many times that no serious person talks or listens to him anymore, but who continues to bowl on in abject public humiliation.  The fallen columnist, in his world of transcendent absurdity, can simply invent news; witness Alsop's recent smear of Harvard professor Martin Peretz.</span></p> <p><span>It has been observed (by columnists of course) that this has been a bad year for columnists.  Their great dilemma has been George McGovern, and acres of print have been ploughed as the columnists tried to turn up the correct on his candidacy.</span></p> <p><span>The early consensus was that candidate McGovern was a persistent but nevertheless hapless loser.  Although the columnists have in recent days triumphantly resurrected this early line, they were given a scare in the spring and summer.</span></p> <p><span><b>L</b>ATE IN THE PRIMARIES there was rumination on the columnists' collective inability to assess McGovern's strengths and the dedication of his constituency; the dawning sense that the political tour guides had themselves missed the boat led to hasty attempts to clamber aboard during convention time, with excessive praise for the sharp young technocrats of the McGovern staff.  Then, having at last paid their dues to McGovern, the columnists could sound objective as they announced a coming Nixon landslide and scolded the post-Eagleton McGovern for not living up to the conventiontime notices on his efficient and pragmatic organization.  The columnists wrote with contempt--each of them seeming to say.  \"My God, I could run a presidential campaign better than this guy.\"</span></p> <p><span>In fact, after watching some of them this summer in Washington.  I am convinced that columnists invariably measure the candidates against themselves.  \"Is this politician,\" they ask themselves, \"smarter and tougher than I am?\"  If they decide yes, then everything that they subsequently write is conditioned by respect and deference.  Judgment is deferred on the superior candidate's most obvious blunders, on the chance that they are not blunders at all, but strokes of genius that will become apparent by noon the day of the column's release.</span></p> <p><span>Doping out the \"real news\" becomes a complex intrigue, if the superior candidate is acting on information not publicly available, a summary of the merely public facts will serve notice to the insiders that the columnist is an outsider.  Being an outsider in Washington is the kiss of death.  The phone stops ringing.  Lunch dates are cancelled.  The columnist's voice takes on a tremulous uncertainty, and is no longer the gravel-pitched.  \"Don't shit me buddy\" that opens doors in Washington.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT SUPPOSE THE COLUMNIST decides that <i>he</i> is tougher and smarter than the candidate; that the candidate himself is an outsider, whose sources of information and standing on the machismo ladder are inferior to the journalist's.  Then the columnist becomes a suffering and occasionally furious papa, lecturing the candidate as if he were a twelve year old.</span></p> <p><span>Until his China trip.  Richard Nixon was generally treated by the columnists--confident that they were smarter and tougher than the President--as a malevolent and silly child.  Now, somehow, he's a political genius.  George McGovern has become the class served up some bacon, and set to work each morning with a knife and fork.  Why this cruelty?  Because McGovern had shown weakness:  he had shown himself to be politically salve.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to their viciousness, the columnists also have a predilection for foolishness as in their daily discoveries this summer that McGovern is not after all a hair-shirted secetic, but a Democratic Party politician not too different from the rest.  Feasting on such obvious and worthless information, we roll along toward October, with the columnists still yapping their way through assessments and re-assessments of candidate McGovern:  like dogs, snapping at the air as they pursue their own tails.</span></p> <p><span><b>P</b>ERHAPS THE MOST charitable thing that can be said about the columnists is that they have been ill-equipped to deal with McGovern.  Living in Washington, solicitously hovering around the inside sources that are their tickets to fame and prosperity, they see very little of the real world.  We see more even in book-laden Cambridge.  Since all the people the columnists know are centrists, they counsel McGovern to move toward the center, ignoring the fact that it was a disastrous position for his Democratic rivals.  Since all the people the columnists know seem to think that \"issues\" are a waste of time, they counsel McGovern to stop talking about the issues.</span></p> <p><span>Like many people sympathetic to his campaign.  I have criticism of McGovern.  Chief among them is that lately he seems to be listening to the columnists, who--unable to understand the roots of his campaign--have offered him consistently bad advice.  McGovern would do better to listen to the coalition that made him a viable candidate won him his primaries, and insured his victory at Miami Beach:  the antiwar left and the minorities For as David Kolodney noted in a recent <i>Ram parts</i> article McGovern has not been delivered to this coalition as a consolation prize; he is instead the first mainstream emblem of its growing political power.  This coalition now has the political muscle to nominate the Democratic Party candidate.  Whether it has the muscle to elect a President remains an open question.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>Y REALIZING THAT McGovern is important largely because he represents an important political coalition we can discount one of the liberal truisms of this campaign--that this is the great watershed election, whose results will determine the political course of the next thirty years.  Such dire prognosis is wrong, insofar as it assumes that the political developments that gave birth to the McGovern candidacy will roll over and play dead if Nixon wins by a landslide.  It's not that the left isn't subject to fits of moribund depression that would follow a Nixon victory.  It has already proved that it is.  It is rather that party politics, the nation, and the world are in a period of profound transition, not likely to be frozen by any one political event.</span></p> <p><span>This election is, nevertheless, critical, but for much simpler and more basic reasons.  We all know what they are, but they bear repeating.  The people of Indochina are being systematically exterminated by the present campaign of American terror, waged to prove a point that is already lost--that the United States can crush popular revolutionary insurrection in the Third World.  We have not crushed the Vietnamese and we will not.  George McGovern, at the very least, understands that basic political reality.  And that is reason enough, in 1972, to elect him President of the United States.</span></p> <p><span>There are other reasons as well.  He is, by all accounts, a moral man.  And it is perhaps for this reason that he has proved so inept a politician recently.  Only a moral man could tell such halfhearted and graceless lies, or be so club-footed in political maneuvering.  By comparison, the professional liars of the Nixon administration seem like politicians of great sophistication and subtlety, which of course, they are not.  No administration in recent memory has, for example, so bungled its relations with Congress as the Nixon crew.</span></p> <p><span><b>Y</b>ET BECAUSE WE LIVE in such a time of dispirited confusion.  Nixon has already gained the ultimate goal of the professional liar:  complete and profound mystification of his audience.  Like the magician, Nixon's posture of solemn, unblinking deception convinces us to suspend our critical faculties and to accept his illusion for reality.  In political terms.  Nixon's accomplishment has been simply this:  he has convinced many of us that politics is a dirty lying business rather than that he and his friends are a dirty lying bunch.  Or, put in language close to home for us here at a university.  Nixon is convincing Americans that they live in a Hobbesian world of fearful manipulation, and that they ought to be manipulated by someone who is adept.</span></p> <p><span>This is the most sorry and potentially dangerous outcome of the Nixon years--that they have so baldly devalued political discourse that no one will ever be believed again.  But political lying is not peculiar to Nixon and it would not be vanquished through a Nixon defeat it is an historical cancer brought to acute malignancy by the heroic lying of Lyndon Johnson who truly was the politician that Nixon pretends to be.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the universality of political lying, there is among some McGovern supporters a kind of desperate McGovern supporters a kind of desperate Messianism; they seem to believe that McGovern is so fine and decent a man that his election in November would save the world from oblivion.  Columinists and others rightly find this attitude amusing.  So should we all for in abstracting the image of the saintly McGovern from the realities of politics, it undercuts his only chance of winning; that is, organizing a grass roots constituency whose members are not in the least interested in political saints or martyrs.  McGovern might still capture such a grass roots constituency, for one of his greatest strengths is precisely that he is not a particularly noble or unusual man.  His decency and his self-effacing manner are typical American virtues albert atypical in the world of D.C. machismo.</span></p> <p><span>Columnists generally invoke commonsense sociology as they close off their spouts.  Everyone knows by now the sociological law that emerged from the ghetto riots of the sixties people get angry and fight for their rights when their expectations of what is possible begin to rise.  McGovern promises something better than what we now have, and whether he is able as President to deliver it is irrelevant to the fact that in making the promise, he raises our hopes and makes it more likely that we will take our complaints with the social order more seriously.</span></p> <p><span>A corollary to this pop law of the sixties is another, which the left has been slow to learn both in our time and in times past.  When deceit and social neglect become cushrined as principles of government, they do not breed revolt.  A decaying social order is not the fertile breeding ground of social change.  It is a barrea wasteland in which visible movement disappears.  This wasteland is the home ground of Nixonian politics Nixonian politics must be defeated if not this time then soon</span></p>"}

Like any good political card player, he knows where his hand is strong.  Given the backing of Big Money and the solvency of the national Republican party Nixon knows he holds the Ace and King of Diamonds for the upcoming campaign.  The success of a series of $100-a-plate-and-up dinners and other fund-raising ploys has also made him long in the Diamonds suit.</span></p> <p><span>Despite his <illegible> either to end the War or exorcise the <illegible> Duo, depression and inflation, from the national economy, Nixon has retained his strength in Clubs, his trump suit in his <illegible> victory.  Carefully choreographed announcements of troop withdrawals and <illegible> diplomacy and the statistical <illegible> of declining crime rates have <illegible> the AMVETS, Knights of Columbus, and <illegible> Clubs card carriers of middle America <illegible> the belief that the President is <illegible> down the war and cracking down <illegible> crime and disorder.  Moreover, Nixon <illegible> been able to \"deescalate\" in <illegible> without alienating the career military, <illegible> military industries or the numerous middle <illegible> communities whose post-Korean economic growth has been directly proportional to the size of the defense budget; <illegible> because Nixon has not de-escalated <illegible> expenditures.  As a result Nixon has <illegible> strength in Wallace Country, largely <illegible> because towns like Huntsville, Alabama <illegible> what keeps their bread buttered. <p>To be sure, the <illegible> have been breaks in the ranks.  Even within <illegible> party, with McCloskey leading a defection <illegible> the left and Ashbrook leading one on <illegible> right.  But Nixon has managed to <illegible> a generally accepted illusion that the <illegible> is in the process of a directed <illegible> from Vietnam--he has been so <illegible> at this hidden-soldier trick that he <illegible>.  The issue of Vietnam will not be an <illegible> the campaign\"--and that his Administration <illegible> is preparing itself to grapple with the <illegible> Issues, both domestic and diplomatic, <illegible> Nixon's second term. <p><b>\"N</b>IXON'S <illegible> TERM,\" one is at once startled and <illegible> by the notion.  The first three year <illegible> his Presidency have been a persuasive <illegible> of the leitmotif of his '68 <illegible>:  \"Nixon's the One!\"  He may not be the <illegible> want, but he is the one you're with.  At <illegible>--writing a piece on the first anniversary <illegible> State was one of my own--the Nixon affliction seems to threaten to worsen from the chronic to the malignantly permanent. <p>Fact:  Twenty years ago today, Richard Nixon was Vice-President of the United States.  The 18 year olds who discovered yesterday what their chances are of becoming the last American to die in Vietnam and who may, if they live that long, vote for the first time in November were as yet unborn, and as a result, can not read a particular meaning from that fact.  But many of their parents can, and must feel a certain nagging respect for the man when they contrast his conspicuous survival with their own sense of dissolution and decline. </p><p>Clearly a medium of the Nixonian message has been applied to Madison Avenue.  Improved make-up and stylized lighting have erased his five o'clock shadow and Nixon-speak--Vietnamization, Phase II, incursion, game plan--and alliterative Agnewese ring in the inner ear.  But no amount of pancake and greasepaint and well-placed Fresnels could gloss Nixon's profound physical gracelessness.  There is a fatal slowness about the man that pervades his surprise announcements on national television with the forced enthusiasm and unsuccessful electricity of Ed Sullivan bringing on Baldy Laird and his Vietnamese Dancing Bear as the headliner of another really big show. </p><p>Charisma never was and never will be a negotiable asset of Nixon's, but the man who brought us the forgettable public tragedies of Checkers and Cambodia and the toothless tiger of Phase II has proven that we do not value charisma as much as we think we do.  Or that, more precisely, charisma is not the <i>sine qua non</i> that it is cracked up to be.  His career testifies that a patient, practised and lucky player can finesse a winner from a political hand as apparently irreparably weak as Nixon's was after his defeat in California in '62. </p><p>\"I think the idea is rather prevalent among a great number of people that what the country needs is a spectacular, if not flamboyant, charismatic figure as a leader,\" Nixon has said.  \"There are some others, however, who might say that when you really have a crunch, when it is really tough, when the decision made in this office may determine the future of war and peace, not just now but for generations to come, that you had better make the choice in terms of an individual who is totally cool, detached and with some experience.  Now I am not describing anybody, of course...\" Nixon said, poker-faced. </p><p><b>III</b> </p><p><b>O</b>NE CAN WIN at political poker through a number of proven strategies:  a Fair Deal, a Square Deal, a New Deal.  If Nixon wins in November, the strategy of the Big Sleep will have to be added to the list of successful political approaches. </p><p>A modern Rip Van Winkle, emerging from a 20-year siesta in Sleepy Hollow, would probably vote for Nixon in September because it would be the only name on the ballot he would recognize.  Moreover, he would not only recognize the name but also the style, for as Nixon himself notes, his style has not been adapted to keep pace with the times. </p><p>Since '68, Humphrey has let his sideburns down.  Wallace has de-emphasized race in his rhetoric, and McCarthy has tergiversated on the mere question of his candidacy.  Through it all, Nixon has been as fundamentally constant as the northern star.  \"I don't intend to change my style,\" he has said.  \"I determined that when I came into office.  Of course I couldn't if I wanted to.\" </p><p>It is precisely Poor Richard's recognition of the limits of his adaptability that has allowed him to accrue a certain strength in the Hearts suit of his political hand.  Through two decades of social change, he has remained recognizably unfashionable, but through his ability to defuse this weakness as an issue he has managed to survive--as if he had been granted a divine exemption from the laws of Darwinian adaptation--to the point that he has lulled many voters into the political sleep of resignation and parlayed his personal weaknesses into strengths.  What was derided in a Congressman as trickiness is in a President proclaimed by <i>Time</i> as the \"flair for secrecy and surprise that has marked his leadership as both refreshingly flexible and disconcertingly unpredictable...<i>(and made Nixon)</i> undeniably Man of the Year.\" </p><p>Like any good poker player running a bluff, Citizen Richard does not adapt, but forces adaptation:  \"I am the President!\"  Deal with it. </p><p>In so doing he has carved a formidable political image on the national consciousness:  Nixon is the one who in spite of all of the hostile indifference of the deck has bluffed future shock. </p><p><b>IV</b> </p><p><b>H</b>OWEVER, IT IS UNDENIABLY CLEAR that Nixon is bluffing, hoping that he can finesse a return ticket to the White House.  Completing a suit-by-suit survey of his political hand for '72, one is suddenly aware of the reason for the bluff.  He has a fatal void in Spades. </p><p>If in 1872 one had told a newly-enfranchised ex-slave who had just cast his first vote for Ulysses S. Grant that the time would come when a Republican President would be faced by the possibility of defeat because of a lack of black support, he would have told you you were plumb crazy.  The very notion that any black would ever vote against the party of Lincoln would have seemed to him as ridiculously impossible as the idea that a Republican President would one day be accused of practising the malignant neglect of a Southern Strategy. </p><p>For almost fifty years after blacks first exerted national political leverage in 1868, the black vote was dependably Republican and often pivotal.  During that 50 year period, only two Democrats were able to defeat the Republican Presidential candidate as blacks mistook the Hayes's and Tafts and McKinleys for the Second Coming of Abraham Lincoln. </p><p>First in the Deep South during Reconstruction and later in the border states, blacks were the bulk of the Republican rank-and-file and used their numbers to secure positions of leadership within the party.  All twenty of the black Congressmen and both of the black Senators elected during Reconstruction were Republicans. </p><p>Democrats and white Southerners in general found the new political power of blacks in the Republican party supremely distasteful.  As Frederick Douglass notes the comments of one:  \"'The maddest, most unscrupulous and infamous revolution in history has snatched the power from the hands of the race which settled the country...and transferred it to its former slaves, an ignorant and feeble race.'\" </p><p>The white Southerners, of course, had only themselves to blame.  They, after all, had been the people who had constantly demanded that the supply of slaves be increased.  They had lost their war with the North largely because so much of the South's capital was in the fatally non-negotiable form of chattel slavery.  Moreover, fearing that any mobilization of the black population would lead to the formation of a hostile fifth column, the Confederacy failed to make any practical use of its major source of manpower. </p><p><b>T</b>HE UNION WAS LESS RELUCTANT, and as a result, won the war.  Universal manhood suffrage allowed the Republicans to win the peace.  Blacks registered for the first time in 1867, and, as DuBois and others have noted, they outnumbered whites in the recently re-admitted states of the South 703, 459 to 660, 181.  The black majority was a sizeable one in Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida and was almost two to one in South Carolina and Louisiana. </p><p>Although the full leverage of this numerical advantage was never felt, the black vote was the critical mass is the three national elections during Reconstruction.  Even after Hayes, whose election had been as dependent on the black vote as it was on the deal he made with the Southern Democrats, had honored his end of the compromise of 1877, and removed the Federal troops whose presence had protected black <i>de facto enfranchisement,</i> blacks continued to be loyal to the Republican party.  Although this loyalty was decidedly more advantageous to the Republicans than it was to blacks, the arrangement was not without token compensations.  Beginning with Grant, who appointed Frederick Douglass commissioner to Santo Domingo and later minister to Haiti, black Republicans were appointed to significant Federal posts.  Even after Reconstruction, they secured patronage jobs like collector of internal revenue or customs duties for a given city, local consular agent or postmaster, or register of the Federal Treasury.</p><p>Moreover, blacks continued to exercise power within the councils of the Republican party.  Although the Hayes Compromise illustrates that much of this power was illusionary and provisional, the fact that two blacks--Blanche Kelso Bruce in 1880 and John R. Lynch in 1884--became temporary chairman of successive Republican conventions is not totally devoid of significance.</p><p>First, it indicates the importance that Republicans placed on the black vote, even after by its own actions--or more precisely that actions of Hayes--it had brought about the political bankruptcy of black people in the Deep South.  Second, it demonstrates the degree to which politically skillful black men were able to institutionalize their power within the party.  Both Bruce and Kelso were from Mississippi, a state that had been fatally unreconstructed by Hayes's removal of the Federal troops.  Although this meant that it was impossible for either man to deliver the same vote in the national election that they had earlier given to the Republican candidate, it was not until 1916 that the party took practical recognition of this reality and adjusted its policy of delegate apportionment so that Southern blacks became as effectively powerless within the party as they were useless to the party in the national election.</p><p>Most importantly, the honorific positions held by Kelso and Bruce are symptomatic of the basic strategy the Republican party has employed in its efforts to influence the black vote and continues.  As Daniel Thompson notes in his 1963 study of the upper echelons of black society in New Orleans:</p><p><i>Unlike the Democratic party, which ignores Negro political leaders in state and national policy-making, the Republican party, with only about 250 Negro members in the city, has consistently included its single Negro leader in its policy-making.  Though powerless in local elections, he has served as secretary of the Orleans Parish Republican Executive Committee, and as a delegate to the party's national convention.</i></p><p><b>Y</b>ET ALL OF THE TEMPORARY NATIONAL CHAIRMANSHIPS, Parish and County Secretariates and Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Chiefs for Minority Relations could not have tempered the tide of the black migration to the North and the ensuing abandonment of the Republican party by the majority of black voters.</p><p>Under the leadership of men like William Levi Dawson and Oscar DePriest in Chicago, blacks entered the urban political situation as nominal Republicans during the First World War.  DePriest became the city's first black alderman in 1915, and was succeeded by another black, Louis B. Anderson, two years later, Anderson remained on the city council for 16 years.  By 1930, blacks had become politically potent enough to elect DePriest as the first black Congressman from above the Master-Dixon Line, and the first elected black to go to Washington in 28 years.</p><p>However, soon after DePriest's election, the economic collapse following the Stock Market Crash threatened the Republican party with political bankruptcy.  The mass of black voters brought up in the tradition of total support of the Republican ticket found it hard to break the habit.  In the election of '32 only 23 per cent of Chicago's blacks voted for Roosevelt.</p><p>More importantly, in the mayoral election the previous year, the Republican candidate, Big Bill Thompson, who in his 16 years as Mayor, had \"courted the South Side win such fervor that he became known as 'The Second Lincoln,' and <illegible> so many Negroes to <illegible> jobs that his opponents referred to City Hall as 'Uncle Tom's <illegible>,\" had been defeated by a <illegible>, who had displayed a hostile <illegible> to the black vote.  Having won without blacks, Cermak was under no obligation to the back ward machine and freely divested it of whatever sources of patronage Thompson had given it.<p>In 1934, DePriest, seeking a third term in Congress, was defeated by a black Republican turned Democrat, Arthur W. Mitchell.  The defeat marked the end of DePriest's political career.  The year before Mayor Cermak had been assassinated in Florida by a bullet aimed at President Roosevelt, and Cermak was succeeded by Edward J. Kelly.  As Mayor, Kelly made an even more intensive effort than Big Bill Thompson had to woo Chicago's ever-increasing black vote.  Reading the handwriting on the wall, William Dawson, who after DePriest's defeat was the leading black Republican in the city, switched parties in 1938.  Dawson's election to Congress in '43 coupled with that of Adam Clayton Powell two years later finalized the switch of black political loyalty from the Republicans to the Democrats.  <i>..The concluding half--</i>Void in Spades II--<i>will appear in tomorrow's Crimson.</i></p></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></p></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></p></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></p></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></span></p> <p>To be sure, the <illegible> have been breaks in the ranks.

The very notion that any black would ever vote against the party of Lincoln would have seemed to him as ridiculously impossible as the idea that a Republican President would one day be accused of practising the malignant neglect of a Southern Strategy. </p><p>For almost fifty years after blacks first exerted national political leverage in 1868, the black vote was dependably Republican and often pivotal.

As Frederick Douglass notes the comments of one:  \"'The maddest, most unscrupulous and infamous revolution in history has snatched the power from the hands of the race which settled the country...and transferred it to its former slaves, an ignorant and feeble race.'\" </p><p>The white Southerners, of course, had only themselves to blame.  They, after all, had been the people who had constantly demanded that the supply of slaves be increased.  They had lost their war with the North largely because so much of the South's capital was in the fatally non-negotiable form of chattel slavery.  Moreover, fearing that any mobilization of the black population would lead to the formation of a hostile fifth column, the Confederacy failed to make any practical use of its major source of manpower. </p><p><b>T</b>HE UNION WAS LESS RELUCTANT, and as a result, won the war.  Universal manhood suffrage allowed the Republicans to win the peace.  Blacks registered for the first time in 1867, and, as DuBois and others have noted, they outnumbered whites in the recently re-admitted states of the South 703, 459 to 660, 181.  The black majority was a sizeable one in Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida and was almost two to one in South Carolina and Louisiana. </p><p>Although the full leverage of this numerical advantage was never felt, the black vote was the critical mass is the three national elections during Reconstruction.  Even after Hayes, whose election had been as dependent on the black vote as it was on the deal he made with the Southern Democrats, had honored his end of the compromise of 1877, and removed the Federal troops whose presence had protected black <i>de facto enfranchisement,</i> blacks continued to be loyal to the Republican party.  Although this loyalty was decidedly more advantageous to the Republicans than it was to blacks, the arrangement was not without token compensations.  Beginning with Grant, who appointed Frederick Douglass commissioner to Santo Domingo and later minister to Haiti, black Republicans were appointed to significant Federal posts.  Even after Reconstruction, they secured patronage jobs like collector of internal revenue or customs duties for a given city, local consular agent or postmaster, or register of the Federal Treasury.</p><p>Moreover, blacks continued to exercise power within the councils of the Republican party.

Completing a suit-by-suit survey of his political hand for '72, one is suddenly aware of the reason for the bluff.  He has a fatal void in Spades. </p><p>If in 1872 one had told a newly-enfranchised ex-slave who had just cast his first vote for Ulysses S. Grant that the time would come when a Republican President would be faced by the possibility of defeat because of a lack of black support, he would have told you you were plumb crazy.  The very notion that any black would ever vote against the party of Lincoln would have seemed to him as ridiculously impossible as the idea that a Republican President would one day be accused of practising the malignant neglect of a Southern Strategy. </p><p>For almost fifty years after blacks first exerted national political leverage in 1868, the black vote was dependably Republican and often pivotal.  During that 50 year period, only two Democrats were able to defeat the Republican Presidential candidate as blacks mistook the Hayes's and Tafts and McKinleys for the Second Coming of Abraham Lincoln. </p><p>First in the Deep South during Reconstruction and later in the border states, blacks were the bulk of the Republican rank-and-file and used their numbers to secure positions of leadership within the party.  All twenty of the black Congressmen and both of the black Senators elected during Reconstruction were Republicans. </p><p>Democrats and white Southerners in general found the new political power of blacks in the Republican party supremely distasteful.  As Frederick Douglass notes the comments of one:  \"'The maddest, most unscrupulous and infamous revolution in history has snatched the power from the hands of the race which settled the country...and transferred it to its former slaves, an ignorant and feeble race.'\" </p><p>The white Southerners, of course, had only themselves to blame.  They, after all, had been the people who had constantly demanded that the supply of slaves be increased.  They had lost their war with the North largely because so much of the South's capital was in the fatally non-negotiable form of chattel slavery.  Moreover, fearing that any mobilization of the black population would lead to the formation of a hostile fifth column, the Confederacy failed to make any practical use of its major source of manpower. </p><p><b>T</b>HE UNION WAS LESS RELUCTANT, and as a result, won the war.  Universal manhood suffrage allowed the Republicans to win the peace.  Blacks registered for the first time in 1867, and, as DuBois and others have noted, they outnumbered whites in the recently re-admitted states of the South 703, 459 to 660, 181.  The black majority was a sizeable one in Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida and was almost two to one in South Carolina and Louisiana. </p><p>Although the full leverage of this numerical advantage was never felt, the black vote was the critical mass is the three national elections during Reconstruction.  Even after Hayes, whose election had been as dependent on the black vote as it was on the deal he made with the Southern Democrats, had honored his end of the compromise of 1877, and removed the Federal troops whose presence had protected black <i>de facto enfranchisement,</i> blacks continued to be loyal to the Republican party.  Although this loyalty was decidedly more advantageous to the Republicans than it was to blacks, the arrangement was not without token compensations.  Beginning with Grant, who appointed Frederick Douglass commissioner to Santo Domingo and later minister to Haiti, black Republicans were appointed to significant Federal posts.  Even after Reconstruction, they secured patronage jobs like collector of internal revenue or customs duties for a given city, local consular agent or postmaster, or register of the Federal Treasury.</p><p>Moreover, blacks continued to exercise power within the councils of the Republican party.  Although the Hayes Compromise illustrates that much of this power was illusionary and provisional, the fact that two blacks--Blanche Kelso Bruce in 1880 and John R. Lynch in 1884--became temporary chairman of successive Republican conventions is not totally devoid of significance.</p><p>First, it indicates the importance that Republicans placed on the black vote, even after by its own actions--or more precisely that actions of Hayes--it had brought about the political bankruptcy of black people in the Deep South.  Second, it demonstrates the degree to which politically skillful black men were able to institutionalize their power within the party.  Both Bruce and Kelso were from Mississippi, a state that had been fatally unreconstructed by Hayes's removal of the Federal troops.  Although this meant that it was impossible for either man to deliver the same vote in the national election that they had earlier given to the Republican candidate, it was not until 1916 that the party took practical recognition of this reality and adjusted its policy of delegate apportionment so that Southern blacks became as effectively powerless within the party as they were useless to the party in the national election.</p><p>Most importantly, the honorific positions held by Kelso and Bruce are symptomatic of the basic strategy the Republican party has employed in its efforts to influence the black vote and continues.  As Daniel Thompson notes in his 1963 study of the upper echelons of black society in New Orleans:</p><p><i>Unlike the Democratic party, which ignores Negro political leaders in state and national policy-making, the Republican party, with only about 250 Negro members in the city, has consistently included its single Negro leader in its policy-making.  Though powerless in local elections, he has served as secretary of the Orleans Parish Republican Executive Committee, and as a delegate to the party's national convention.</i></p><p><b>Y</b>ET ALL OF THE TEMPORARY NATIONAL CHAIRMANSHIPS, Parish and County Secretariates and Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Chiefs for Minority Relations could not have tempered the tide of the black migration to the North and the ensuing abandonment of the Republican party by the majority of black voters.</p><p>Under the leadership of men like William Levi Dawson and Oscar DePriest in Chicago, blacks entered the urban political situation as nominal Republicans during the First World War.  DePriest became the city's first black alderman in 1915, and was succeeded by another black, Louis B. Anderson, two years later, Anderson remained on the city council for 16 years.  By 1930, blacks had become politically potent enough to elect DePriest as the first black Congressman from above the Master-Dixon Line, and the first elected black to go to Washington in 28 years.</p><p>However, soon after DePriest's election, the economic collapse following the Stock Market Crash threatened the Republican party with political bankruptcy.  The mass of black voters brought up in the tradition of total support of the Republican ticket found it hard to break the habit.  In the election of '32 only 23 per cent of Chicago's blacks voted for Roosevelt.</p><p>More importantly, in the mayoral election the previous year, the Republican candidate, Big Bill Thompson, who in his 16 years as Mayor, had \"courted the South Side win such fervor that he became known as 'The Second Lincoln,' and <illegible> so many Negroes to <illegible> jobs that his opponents referred to City Hall as 'Uncle Tom's <illegible>,\" had been defeated by a <illegible>, who had displayed a hostile <illegible> to the black vote.  Having won without blacks, Cermak was under no obligation to the back ward machine and freely divested it of whatever sources of patronage Thompson had given it.<p>In 1934, DePriest, seeking a third term in Congress, was defeated by a black Republican turned Democrat, Arthur W. Mitchell.  The defeat marked the end of DePriest's political career.  The year before Mayor Cermak had been assassinated in Florida by a bullet aimed at President Roosevelt, and Cermak was succeeded by Edward J. Kelly.  As Mayor, Kelly made an even more intensive effort than Big Bill Thompson had to woo Chicago's ever-increasing black vote.  Reading the handwriting on the wall, William Dawson, who after DePriest's defeat was the leading black Republican in the city, switched parties in 1938.  Dawson's election to Congress in '43 coupled with that of Adam Clayton Powell two years later finalized the switch of black political loyalty from the Republicans to the Democrats.  <i>..The concluding half--</i>Void in Spades II--<i>will appear in tomorrow's Crimson.</i></p></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></p></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></p></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></span></p> <p><b>\"N</b>IXON'S <illegible> TERM,\" one is at once startled and <illegible> by the notion.

Both Bruce and Kelso were from Mississippi, a state that had been fatally unreconstructed by Hayes's removal of the Federal troops.

As Daniel Thompson notes in his 1963 study of the upper echelons of black society in New Orleans:</p> <p><i>Unlike the Democratic party, which ignores Negro political leaders in state and national policy-making, the Republican party, with only about 250 Negro members in the city, has consistently included its single Negro leader in its policy-making.

DePriest became the city's first black alderman in 1915, and was succeeded by another black, Louis B. Anderson, two years later, Anderson remained on the city council for 16 years.  By 1930, blacks had become politically potent enough to elect DePriest as the first black Congressman from above the Master-Dixon Line, and the first elected black to go to Washington in 28 years.</p> <p>However, soon after DePriest's election, the economic collapse following the Stock Market Crash threatened the Republican party with political bankruptcy.  The mass of black voters brought up in the tradition of total support of the Republican ticket found it hard to break the habit.

The year before Mayor Cermak had been assassinated in Florida by a bullet aimed at President Roosevelt, and Cermak was succeeded by Edward J. Kelly.

Grant that the time would come when a Republican President would be faced by the possibility of defeat because of a lack of black support, he would have told you you were plumb crazy.  The very notion that any black would ever vote against the party of Lincoln would have seemed to him as ridiculously impossible as the idea that a Republican President would one day be accused of practising the malignant neglect of a Southern Strategy. </p><p>For almost fifty years after blacks first exerted national political leverage in 1868, the black vote was dependably Republican and often pivotal.

As Frederick Douglass notes the comments of one:  \"'The maddest, most unscrupulous and infamous revolution in history has snatched the power from the hands of the race which settled the country...and transferred it to its former slaves, an ignorant and feeble race.'\" </p><p>The white Southerners, of course, had only themselves to blame.  They, after all, had been the people who had constantly demanded that the supply of slaves be increased.  They had lost their war with the North largely because so much of the South's capital was in the fatally non-negotiable form of chattel slavery.  Moreover, fearing that any mobilization of the black population would lead to the formation of a hostile fifth column, the Confederacy failed to make any practical use of its major source of manpower. </p><p><b>T</b>HE UNION WAS LESS RELUCTANT, and as a result, won the war.  Universal manhood suffrage allowed the Republicans to win the peace.  Blacks registered for the first time in 1867, and, as DuBois and others have noted, they outnumbered whites in the recently re-admitted states of the South 703, 459 to 660, 181.  The black majority was a sizeable one in Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida and was almost two to one in South Carolina and Louisiana. </p><p>Although the full leverage of this numerical advantage was never felt, the black vote was the critical mass is the three national elections during Reconstruction.  Even after Hayes, whose election had been as dependent on the black vote as it was on the deal he made with the Southern Democrats, had honored his end of the compromise of 1877, and removed the Federal troops whose presence had protected black <i>de facto enfranchisement,</i> blacks continued to be loyal to the Republican party.  Although this loyalty was decidedly more advantageous to the Republicans than it was to blacks, the arrangement was not without token compensations.  Beginning with Grant, who appointed Frederick Douglass commissioner to Santo Domingo and later minister to Haiti, black Republicans were appointed to significant Federal posts.

His career testifies that a patient, practised and lucky player can finesse a winner from a political hand as apparently irreparably weak as Nixon's was after his defeat in California in '62.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think the idea is rather prevalent among a great number of people that what the country needs is a spectacular, if not flamboyant, charismatic figure as a leader,\" Nixon has said.  \"There are some others, however, who might say that when you really have a crunch, when it is really tough, when the decision made in this office may determine the future of war and peace, not just now but for generations to come, that you had better make the choice in terms of an individual who is totally cool, detached and with some experience.  Now I am not describing anybody, of course...\" Nixon said, poker-faced.</span></p> <p><span><b>III</b></span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>NE CAN WIN at political poker through a number of proven strategies:  a Fair Deal, a Square Deal, a New Deal.  If Nixon wins in November, the strategy of the Big Sleep will have to be added to the list of successful political approaches.</span></p> <p><span>A modern Rip Van Winkle, emerging from a 20-year siesta in Sleepy Hollow, would probably vote for Nixon in September because it would be the only name on the ballot he would recognize.  Moreover, he would not only recognize the name but also the style, for as Nixon himself notes, his style has not been adapted to keep pace with the times.</span></p> <p><span>Since '68, Humphrey has let his sideburns down.  Wallace has de-emphasized race in his rhetoric, and McCarthy has tergiversated on the mere question of his candidacy.  Through it all, Nixon has been as fundamentally constant as the northern star.  \"I don't intend to change my style,\" he has said.  \"I determined that when I came into office.  Of course I couldn't if I wanted to.\"</span></p> <p><span>It is precisely Poor Richard's recognition of the limits of his adaptability that has allowed him to accrue a certain strength in the Hearts suit of his political hand.  Through two decades of social change, he has remained recognizably unfashionable, but through his ability to defuse this weakness as an issue he has managed to survive--as if he had been granted a divine exemption from the laws of Darwinian adaptation--to the point that he has lulled many voters into the political sleep of resignation and parlayed his personal weaknesses into strengths.  What was derided in a Congressman as trickiness is in a President proclaimed by <i>Time</i> as the \"flair for secrecy and surprise that has marked his leadership as both refreshingly flexible and disconcertingly unpredictable...<i>(and made Nixon)</i> undeniably Man of the Year.\"</span></p> <p><span>Like any good poker player running a bluff, Citizen Richard does not adapt, but forces adaptation:  \"I am the President!\"  Deal with it.</span></p> <p><span>In so doing he has carved a formidable political image on the national consciousness:  Nixon is the one who in spite of all of the hostile indifference of the deck has bluffed future shock.</span></p> <p><span><b>IV</b></span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>OWEVER, IT IS UNDENIABLY CLEAR that Nixon is bluffing, hoping that he can finesse a return ticket to the White House.  Completing a suit-by-suit survey of his political hand for '72, one is suddenly aware of the reason for the bluff.  He has a fatal void in Spades.</span></p> <p><span>If in 1872 one had told a newly-enfranchised ex-slave who had just cast his first vote for Ulysses S. Grant that the time would come when a Republican President would be faced by the possibility of defeat because of a lack of black support, he would have told you you were plumb crazy.  The very notion that any black would ever vote against the party of Lincoln would have seemed to him as ridiculously impossible as the idea that a Republican President would one day be accused of practising the malignant neglect of a Southern Strategy.</span></p> <p><span>For almost fifty years after blacks first exerted national political leverage in 1868, the black vote was dependably Republican and often pivotal.  During that 50 year period, only two Democrats were able to defeat the Republican Presidential candidate as blacks mistook the Hayes's and Tafts and McKinleys for the Second Coming of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p> <p><span>First in the Deep South during Reconstruction and later in the border states, blacks were the bulk of the Republican rank-and-file and used their numbers to secure positions of leadership within the party.  All twenty of the black Congressmen and both of the black Senators elected during Reconstruction were Republicans.</span></p> <p><span>Democrats and white Southerners in general found the new political power of blacks in the Republican party supremely distasteful.  As Frederick Douglass notes the comments of one:  \"'The maddest, most unscrupulous and infamous revolution in history has snatched the power from the hands of the race which settled the country...and transferred it to its former slaves, an ignorant and feeble race.'\"</span></p> <p><span>The white Southerners, of course, had only themselves to blame.  They, after all, had been the people who had constantly demanded that the supply of slaves be increased.  They had lost their war with the North largely because so much of the South's capital was in the fatally non-negotiable form of chattel slavery.  Moreover, fearing that any mobilization of the black population would lead to the formation of a hostile fifth column, the Confederacy failed to make any practical use of its major source of manpower.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE UNION WAS LESS RELUCTANT, and as a result, won the war.  Universal manhood suffrage allowed the Republicans to win the peace.  Blacks registered for the first time in 1867, and, as DuBois and others have noted, they outnumbered whites in the recently re-admitted states of the South 703, 459 to 660, 181.  The black majority was a sizeable one in Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida and was almost two to one in South Carolina and Louisiana.</span></p> <p><span>Although the full leverage of this numerical advantage was never felt, the black vote was the critical mass is the three national elections during Reconstruction.  Even after Hayes, whose election had been as dependent on the black vote as it was on the deal he made with the Southern Democrats, had honored his end of the compromise of 1877, and removed the Federal troops whose presence had protected black <i>de facto enfranchisement,</i> blacks continued to be loyal to the Republican party.  Although this loyalty was decidedly more advantageous to the Republicans than it was to blacks, the arrangement was not without token compensations.  Beginning with Grant, who appointed Frederick Douglass commissioner to Santo Domingo and later minister to Haiti, black Republicans were appointed to significant Federal posts.  Even after Reconstruction, they secured patronage jobs like collector of internal revenue or customs duties for a given city, local consular agent or postmaster, or register of the Federal Treasury.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, blacks continued to exercise power within the councils of the Republican party.  Although the Hayes Compromise illustrates that much of this power was illusionary and provisional, the fact that two blacks--Blanche Kelso Bruce in 1880 and John R. Lynch in 1884--became temporary chairman of successive Republican conventions is not totally devoid of significance.</span></p> <p><span>First, it indicates the importance that Republicans placed on the black vote, even after by its own actions--or more precisely that actions of Hayes--it had brought about the political bankruptcy of black people in the Deep South.  Second, it demonstrates the degree to which politically skillful black men were able to institutionalize their power within the party.  Both Bruce and Kelso were from Mississippi, a state that had been fatally unreconstructed by Hayes's removal of the Federal troops.  Although this meant that it was impossible for either man to deliver the same vote in the national election that they had earlier given to the Republican candidate, it was not until 1916 that the party took practical recognition of this reality and adjusted its policy of delegate apportionment so that Southern blacks became as effectively powerless within the party as they were useless to the party in the national election.</span></p> <p><span>Most importantly, the honorific positions held by Kelso and Bruce are symptomatic of the basic strategy the Republican party has employed in its efforts to influence the black vote and continues.  As Daniel Thompson notes in his 1963 study of the upper echelons of black society in New Orleans:</span></p> <p><span><i>Unlike the Democratic party, which ignores Negro political leaders in state and national policy-making, the Republican party, with only about 250 Negro members in the city, has consistently included its single Negro leader in its policy-making.  Though powerless in local elections, he has served as secretary of the Orleans Parish Republican Executive Committee, and as a delegate to the party's national convention.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>Y</b>ET ALL OF THE TEMPORARY NATIONAL CHAIRMANSHIPS, Parish and County Secretariates and Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Chiefs for Minority Relations could not have tempered the tide of the black migration to the North and the ensuing abandonment of the Republican party by the majority of black voters.</span></p> <p><span>Under the leadership of men like William Levi Dawson and Oscar DePriest in Chicago, blacks entered the urban political situation as nominal Republicans during the First World War.  DePriest became the city's first black alderman in 1915, and was succeeded by another black, Louis B. Anderson, two years later, Anderson remained on the city council for 16 years.  By 1930, blacks had become politically potent enough to elect DePriest as the first black Congressman from above the Master-Dixon Line, and the first elected black to go to Washington in 28 years.</span></p> <p><span>However, soon after DePriest's election, the economic collapse following the Stock Market Crash threatened the Republican party with political bankruptcy.  The mass of black voters brought up in the tradition of total support of the Republican ticket found it hard to break the habit.  In the election of '32 only 23 per cent of Chicago's blacks voted for Roosevelt.</span></p> <p><span>More importantly, in the mayoral election the previous year, the Republican candidate, Big Bill Thompson, who in his 16 years as Mayor, had \"courted the South Side win such fervor that he became known as 'The Second Lincoln,' and <illegible> so many Negroes to <illegible> jobs that his opponents referred to City Hall as 'Uncle Tom's <illegible>,\" had been defeated by a <illegible>, who had displayed a hostile <illegible> to the black vote.  Having won without blacks, Cermak was under no obligation to the back ward machine and freely divested it of whatever sources of patronage Thompson had given it.<p>In 1934, DePriest, seeking a third term in Congress, was defeated by a black Republican turned Democrat, Arthur W. Mitchell.  The defeat marked the end of DePriest's political career.  The year before Mayor Cermak had been assassinated in Florida by a bullet aimed at President Roosevelt, and Cermak was succeeded by Edward J. Kelly.  As Mayor, Kelly made an even more intensive effort than Big Bill Thompson had to woo Chicago's ever-increasing black vote.  Reading the handwriting on the wall, William Dawson, who after DePriest's defeat was the leading black Republican in the city, switched parties in 1938.  Dawson's election to Congress in '43 coupled with that of Adam Clayton Powell two years later finalized the switch of black political loyalty from the Republicans to the Democrats.  <i>..The concluding half--</i>Void in Spades II--<i>will appear in tomorrow's Crimson.</i></p></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></illegible></span></p> <p>In 1934, DePriest, seeking a third term in Congress, was defeated by a black Republican turned Democrat, Arthur W.

Cronin, owner of the restaurant, permitting peaceful picketing, will sufficiently \"cover\" an earlier restraining order.  The stipulation will clarify the right of members of the Harvard Square Waitresses Organizing Committee (HSWOC) to resume picketing.</span></p> <p><span>Patricia Welch--one of the eight waitresses whom Cronin fired last week--said yesterday that the picketers will return today.</span></p> <p><span>The hearing was held late yesterday afternoon following the morning decision of Judge Frank W. Tomasello of the Superior Court of Middlesex to extend indefinitely the restraining order forbidding the picketing, and to postpone all further procedures in state court until the issue of proper jurisdiction in the case was settle in federal court.</span></p> <p><span><b>Contempt Hearing</b></span></p> <p><span>The morning hearing had been scheduled for HSWOC to show cause why it was not guilty of contempt of the restraining order.  The defendants named were Stephen R. Domesick, who presented the case of the defendants yesterday afternoon, Kathi Allen and Steven Kehoe.  The three are attorneys for HSWOC, which was founded in December as the official bargaining agent of waitresses at Cronin's Restaurant.</span></p> <p><span>James C. Gahan Jr., the attorney for Cronin, presented the plaintiff's case challenging Federal authority in the litigation.  Following a rebuttal by Gahan on the decision of the court, Julian said, \"I don't think you've understood what I've tried to tell you.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"The fact that the motion to remand (to state court) was filed by you, indicates that you yourself acknowledge that the case is here.\"  Julian said to Gahan.  Julian added that the entire case will remain in his court \"until it is remanded to state court, if it is remanded to state court.\"</span></p> <p><span>Julian spent the first 35 minutes of the 75-minute hearing attempting to determine the chronology of legal events surrounding the case.</span></p> <p><span>Julian said that the rapid succession of petitions filed in several courts during last week had caused extensive confusion.  Both litigants said that, in several instances, there was no \"reasonable notification\" of filing to the other party.</span></p> <p><span>Gahan reported that his client filed a petition to restrain the \"criminal acts of violence\" allegedly committed by picketing HSWOC members on Monday of last week.  Cronin alleged that the union members had threatened employees who wished to work and had harassed customers who tried to enter the restaurant.  Tomasello issued the restraining order in his chambers.</span></p> <p><span><b>Restraining Order</b></span></p> <p><span>The restraining order commanded that HSWOC \"desist from and refrain from (1) illegally picketing:  and (2) annoying, harassing and intimidating employees or customers while on the picket line.\"</span></p> <p><span>Domesick denied yesterday that anyone has ever defied this code.  \"The picketing has always been peaceful,\" he said.  \"Our peaceful picketing is now being enjoined.\"</span></p> <p><span>Domesick explained yesterday that picketers have attempted to \"dissuade\" customers from entering.  Julian concurred that the function of picketing is \"persuasion\" and that this is not legal.</span></p> <p><span>The restraining order was upheld on Wednesday in response to a request by Domesick for a court hearing during which Cronin would present evidence of his charge.  When Judge Julian asked yesterday what evidence had been presented, attorney Gahan floundered and then named only himself and his client as witnesses to the \"criminal acts\" allegedly committed by the picketers.</span></p> <p><span>A motion by Domesick in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, requesting that the lower court decision be overturned, was denied on Friday.</span></p> <p><span>Cronin's accusation of illegal picketing is based primarily on the fact that the waitresses are picketing for a larger wage increase than is allowed by the wage-price freeze.</span></p> <p><span>Responding to the claim that the picketing is in violation of President Nixon's Phase II Economic Guidelines, Domesick's Friday petition to have the case removed from state to federal court was based on the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970.</span></p> <p><span>Gahan must submit the written stipulation permitting peaceful picketing to the federal court by this morning.</span></p> <p><span>Julian asked that Domesick and Gahan submit their statements and affidavits regarding the latter's petition to remand the case to state court by next Tuesday.

{"title": "An End to a Beginning? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>P</b>resident Nixon's disclosure on January 25 of secret negotiations and his publication of a version of the October 11 U.S. peace plan have not improved the chances for a negotiated peace in Vietnam.  Neither the Saigon government nor the North Vietnamese and the Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG) take Nixon's offer seriously, Nixon has used Hanoi's unwillingness to send a high-ranking delegate to Paris for discussions on the October 11 plan with Dr. Kissinger as an excuse to step up the air war.</span></p> <p><span>Although late in October last year Hanoi had agreed to send Politbureau member Le Duc Tho to Paris for talks on November 20, three days before that date, the North Vietnamese informed Washington that Tho was too ill to come.  However, Hanoi's chief delegate to the Paris Talks, Xuan Thuy, was ready for secret talks.  Nixon refused to send Kissinger to talk to Thuy who, according to Kissinger, lacks the authority to negotiate on important matters.</span></p> <p><span>On November 17, the same day that Hanoi informed Washington that Tho would not be coming to Paris, two French newspapers, <i>Le Monde and Le Figaro,</i> reported that Tho would not come and that the United States had stationed five aircraft carriers off the Vietnamese coast--more carriers than the U.S. has ever stationed there at any time during its involvement in Vietnam.  The presence of so many aircraft carriers must have made Hanoi wonder why, before they had even had a chance to give a reply to the secret U.S. peace plan, Nixon and Kissinger were already threatening them.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>n a similar maneuver, before the Doves had had a chance to study the peace plan released on January 25, Henry Kissinger and Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott told newsmen that to oppose the President's plan was to advocate surrender.</span></p> <p><span>Nixon had also stated in his televised speech that Hanoi had deluded the Doves to make the U.S. public believe that Hanoi would separate military from political issues.  During secret negotiations in May 1971, Nixon pointed out, the U.S. had pledged to withdraw all troops within six months if Hanoi agreed to release U.S. prisoners of war and to a cease-fire <i>throughout Indochina.</i></span></p> <p><span>Kissinger told newsmen on January 26 that the North Vietnamese had agreed in principle to a cease-fire, but he neglected to say that Hanoi wanted political agreements to end the war signed at the same time as a cease-fire agreement.</span></p> <p><span>President Nixon, in an interview published in this month's <i>Reader's Digest,</i> suggested that he would prefer to leave political questions for the South Vietnamese to settle after a cease-fire agreement and the completion of the release of U.S. prisoners and of the withdrawal of U.S. troops.</span></p> <p><span>Since Nixon actually knew that Hanoi would not accept separation of a cease-fire from political agreement, he reiterated on January 25 a proposal first presented by the U.S. delegation at the Paris Talks on October 2, 1969, to allow an electoral commission composed of all political groups including the PRG to <i>organize</i> elections in South Vietnam.  For several years, U.S. officials have refused to discuss the extent of the powers such a commission would have to enforce and implement its decisions.  Obviously, Hanoi had clarified that it would not agree to any elections that Thieu could manipulate.</span></p> <p><span>To counter Hanoi's argument on election rigging, Nixon announced on January 25 that President Thieu of the Saigon government had agreed to step down one month before a new presidential election, and that the election itself would take place six months after the U.S. had completed its withdrawal.  On January 26, Thieu's foreign minister stated that before there could be elections the PRG troops would have to <i>lay down their arms and accept</i> 'reintegration' <i>into the community.</i></span></p> <p><span>In the same vein, on February 10 President Nixon acquiesced to Thieu's castigation of Secretary of State Rogers who had told a national gathering of newspaper editors and broadcasters on January 27 that the U.S. would be flexible on the timing of the Thieu resignation and the arrangements for organization of new presidential elections in South Vietnam.  Nixon told newsmen, \"We are not going to negotiate over the heads of our ally with our enemies to overthrow our ally.\"</span></p> <p><span>While the U.S. has proposed that elections take place six months after withdrawal of U.S. troops, the Nixon plan of October 11 stipulates that the countries of Indochina will \"adopt a foreign policy consistent with the military provisions of the 1954 Geneva accords,\" and that after a cease-fire is signed \"there will be no further infiltration of outside forces into the countries of Indochina.\"</span></p> <p><span>The military segment of the Geneva Accords of 1954 provided that all outside parties regroup and then totally withdraw their troops prior to elections--which never took place--in South Vietnam.  In recent years the North Vietnamese have labeled such withdrawal \"mutual,\" and they have repeatedly stated that the question of withdrawal of non-South Vietnamese troops from South Vietnam must be settled after elections.  After the U.S. and its allies withdraw, Hanoi says that <i>all armies</i> would remain intact until after elections when a new government would settle the question of troop disposition.</span></p> <p><span>Nixon's ban on further infiltration is a disguised demand that Hanoi close down the Ho Chi Minh trail.  Since Hanoi's troops and their allies would be fully cut off from their lines of supply, the U.S. supported governments--who would presumably retain their supplies of U.S. military aid--would find themselves at a distinct military advantage.</span></p> <p><span>In his book <i>Vietnam:  Between Two Truces,</i> Jean Lacouture pointed out that in the mid-1950's after Hanoi had withdrawn its troops and had agreed to end the insurrection by the southern Vietminh, the regime of Ngo Dinh Diem took drastic measures:</span></p> <p><span>In 1955 every opponent had been denounced as a left-over from the \"feudal rebels\" supported by colonialism.  After 1956 every opponent was called a communist.</span></p> <p><span>A tremendous war machine was then set up against the Viet Cong.  At first the struggle was conduced by simple means:  concentration camps....</span></p> <p><span>Lacouture added that on May 6, 1959, Diem passed a law which after three days gave military tribunals the power to execute anyone accused of being a \"coinstigator\" of \"attempts against the security of the state.\"</span></p> <p><span>Whereas President Nixon spoke of the need to safeguard the individual rights of the Indochinese in his October 11 plan, his administration was not concerned that the removal of civilians on their own \"free will\" from northernmost to southernmost South Vietnam--which began in late October--would hinder a positive response from Hanoi to his peace plan.  The relocation project grew to impressive dimensions in early January.  On January 13 the PRG charged that the Saigon government's plan to relocate one million civilians would create a free-fire-zone in northernmost South Vietnam in which the U.S. could use tactical nuclear weapons.  Peking and Hanoi have also expressed concern over relocation.</span></p> <p><span>Another serious problem with the U.S. withdrawal proposal of October 11 is it does not firmly prohibit the reintroduction of American forces into Vietnam or the surrounding area.  sAs Secretary Rogers told the editors on January 27, \"We have a defense treaty with Thailand, the SEATO treaty, and Thailand is not involved in the war as Cambodia and Laos are.  So we would expect that we would, at least for the short run, continue to have some Americans in Thailand.  But that doesn't affect the settlement in Indochina...\"</span></p> <p><span>In recent days U.S. officials have indicated that to counter the upcoming communist offensive, two aircraft carriers are on their way to the Vietnamese coast, and one squadron of F4 Phantom bombers and two squadrons of B52s are en route to bases in Thailand.</span></p> <p><span>On April 9, 1971, General R. David, deputy commander of the Marine Corps, said that in case U.S. troops in South Vietnam were seriously endangered, Marine units on board ships off the coast of Vietnam would land in thirty minutes, and the Third Division of Marines would arrive by airlift from Okinawa in five hours.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he return of so much airpower to the Indochina battle-field hides the fact that the Nixon Administration does not really fear that Hanoi and the PRG can do much damage to the Thieu regime during Tet, the lunar new year.  When questioned about the situation a highly placed official appeared to hope that Hanoi would expend all its energies during Tet on the theory that its whole military apparatus would be destroyed.  During the next four years that Hanoi would require to rebuild its forces, the 'force of reason' and a decrease in Russian and Chinese aid would convince Hanoi to negotiate a settlement.  The official also doubted that during this year's Tet offensive the village infrastructure of the Thieu regime would topple as it did in 1968.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever happens during the present dry season fighting, it is unlikely that either side will achieve permanent tactical superiority over the other.  At present there is no sign that a negotiated settlement is in the offing, but indecisive fighting and continued unwillingness on the part of Hanoi to release U.S. prisoners of war will make an eventual political accord unavoidable.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Romanovs in Hollywood | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>P</b>ROFESSIONAL film critics and motion picture moguls have long proclaimed the death of the Big Hollywood movie.  Grand spectacles like <i>Intolerance, Ben Hur, War and Peace</i> and <i>Cleopatra</i> are said to be relics of another era that has ended because of changed audience tastes and a lack of money in the large studios.  But each year there are new examples of the staying-power and constant appeal of such pictures.  <i>Nicholas and Alexandra</i> proves that the public hasn't tired of gazing humbly at larger-than-life historical personalities on the big silver screen.</span></p> <p><span>Luckily however, <i>Nicholas and Alexandra</i> has more going for it than just a generous budget.  It was directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, a man who is usually in solid control of his cameras and last year guided <i>Patton</i> to a virtual sweep of the Academy Awards (Hollywood likes to reward success).  It also concerns a subject and a period that fascinates Americans:  the Russian Revolution.  Almost everyone west of Berlin shares various illusions about the nature of the Russian people, if only because Russia has always deliberately shielded itself from foreign scrutiny.  The average American is eager to view the origins of the United States' chief competitor in the world (witness the popularity of <i>Dr. Zhivago).</i>  In addition, the film has been well cast and no effort has been spared in making it as visually authentic (and lavish) as possible.</span></p> <p><span>The movie, based on Robert K. Massie's historical novel of the same title, focuses on the giants of the revolutionary period.  Lenin, Trotsky and Kerensky are set against Tsar Nicholas II, his German wife Alexandra, their four pure daughters and a son, Alexis, who is crippled by hemophilia.  There is Grigori Rasputin, the Siberian <i>starets</i> whose mystical healing powers and divine judgment endeared him to the Tsarina.  This placed him in a position of immense power within the government, despite his fanatical ambitions and licentious behavior.  And there are Nicholas' ministers and advisers, his generals and soldiers.  All of these people struggle with each other against the background of the Russo-Japanese War, the mounting discontent of the Russian people, World War I and finally the Bolshevik takeover in 1917.</span></p> <p><span>But this same plethora of characters and events forces Schaffner to treat some of them superficially, despite the length of the film (three and one half hours including intermission).  The oppression of the peasants, the \"Red Sunday\" massacre of 1905 and the manuverings of the Communist leaders appear almost as footnotes to the life of Nicholas and Alexandra.  And the movie succumbs to the temptation of introducing famous figures just for the shock appeal; we hardly see Joseph Stalin at all after he boyishly introduces himself to Lenin's wife at a Party meeting.</span></p> <p><span>The main characters also suffer from this cardboard figure effect.  Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman are extremely good in the title roles, but one doesn't believe they were quite as shallow and naive as their lines indicate.  One also wishes that the screenwriter had not put so many \"Nicky\" and \"Sunny\" references in the script; even though Nicholas II was a weak monarch not everyone could have had the audacity to call the Tsar of all the Russians \"Nicky.\"  Even Haldeman, Kissinger and Mitchell have admitted that they always call Nixon \"Mr. President,\" never \"Dick.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nicholas is of course the central figure.  He was weak in character and judgment, an old-fashioned autocrat surrounded by decaying institutions, unable to cope with the new ideas and technological improvements that were completely changing his own 19th-century world.  The revolution that had rocked Europe in both philosophic and industrial terms since the Congress of Vienna in 1815 did not penetrate the unfriendly borders of Russia.  Nicholas felt a token Parliament, the Duma, would stem the revolutionary tide of 1905.  He approved a nationalistic birthday celebration of the 300th year of Romanov reign and relaxed in his luxurious train on a trip into the country, saying in the movie, \"I didn't want to come on this trip, but my God I do love it when they <i>(the peasants)</i> stand and wave.\"  He launched his country into World War I with the belief that sheer weight of Russian numbers could overcome superior German railroads, supplies and weapons.</span></p> <p><span>Nicholas was dominated by his wife, his mother and near the end of the movie, even his young son denounces him for abdicating the throne.  In fairness to Nicholas, it is improbable that any Tsar could have done much better given the conditions of Russia at the beginning of the 20th century.  But Nicholas was certainly guilty of insensitivity and deliverate isolation from the problems of his people and the effects of his decisions.  There is a good scene in which the Tsar is on his way back to Moscow for trial (a journey that is of course interrupted by the execution of Nicholas and his family at Ekaterinburg), and, in a brief discussion with the chief guard, Nicholas Romanov begins to realize the hatred Russia feels for him and the reason he is called \"Bloody Nicholas.\"</span></p> <p><span>There are other very good scenes:  Nicholas on his knees apologizing to Alexandra for abdicating; Lenin's triumphant entry into the St. Petersburg train station where he has come to seize the power that was \"lying on the streets waiting to be picked up;\" the beginning of the First World War just before Intermission, where pictures of Europe's diplomats and monarchs disolve into each other to the sound of marching soldiers and national anthems.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE ACTING is all very competent, and sometimes superlative.  Laurence Olivier is excellent as an aging Count Witte, urging Nicholas not to order mobilization and start a war that would surely change the nature of the world while killing millions for a worthless cause.  Alan Webb and Jack Hawkins also turn in good performances.  Tom Baker is very fine as the lewd and mysterious Rasputin whose deep blue eyes meant the ruin of many good diplomats and the violation of even more young women.  All the characters possess a remarkable physical similarity to their historical conterparts; in Lenin's case the resemblance is phenomenal.</span></p> <p><span>This is a family picture, rated GP and devoid of excessive violence or serious sexuality.  It is a dramatization of the past, better than <i>The Sound of Music</i> but not equal to <i>Gone With the Wind.</i>  Some on the left might quarrel with its simplistic treatment of the Revolution and its causes, but the movie is basically fair, and probably harmless.  In an interview with The New York Post several weeks ago, Schaffner said that he lost more weight during the filming of <i>Nicholas and Alexandra</i> (17 pounds) than during the making of <i>Patton</i> (10 pounds).  Perhaps he was worried that instead of giving him an Oscar this year they will take last year's away and give it to someone else more deserving:  Charlie Chaplin, perhaps?</span></p>"}

For another view, ABC news brings you an exclusive interview with Richard M. Nixon, the defeated Republican candidate in the 1968 Presidential election.  We take you to our reporter in San Clemente, California...\"</span></p> <p><span>\"This is ABC news correspondent Thomas Mondrake at the home of the former Vice President Richard M. Nixon here in lovely San Clemente.  How are you, Mr. Nixon?  It's been quite a long time.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Well, yes, Tom, but this outrageous behavior on the part of the President is enough to scare anyone out of the shadows.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Yes, I see.  Could you explain why your reaction to this Presidential visit is so negative?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Well, you know, it is not so much the policy behind the trip that I object to.  In fact, as you know, Tom, it was I who as early as 1967 said that any American policy in Asia would have to take Red China into account.  So in that sense, I am not trying to put the monkey on the President's back.</span></p> <p><span>\"What I do find objectionable is the style of the meeting itself.  Now, our American Presidents, when they hold summit meetings with Communist leaders, always try to find a midway point, a compromise site, to hold this type of meeting.  Now it is a fact that, before Mr. Humphrey, no American President had ever visited a Communist capital.  But, as you know, this President went right to Peking.</span></p> <p><span>\"Now it is also true that Mr. Humphrey has allowed himself to be entertained in a way that just does not befit an American President.  I have read in the paper that Mr. Humphrey was a guest of the Red Chinese leaders at one of their so-called revolutionary operas.  Now a ping pong tournament or a Chinese band playing American music is one thing, but this other behavior just strikes me as unacceptable and degrading.  This is not common courtesy.  These' are concessions.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"But don't you think, Mr. Nixon, that one needs to make concessions in order to receive concessions in return?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Now, Tom, I have had a long experience in dealing with this type of leader, and let me tell you that they are a different breed of cat.  You try to talk to these people on a friendly basis, you try to talk in their language.  You ask them, do you want to play baseball?  They say, all right, we'll play baseball.  You say, nine men on a side?  Okay, they agree, nine men on a side.  Nine innings in the game?  Fine, nine innings in the game.  Only by the time you're done, there are six men on the team and you are talking about hockey.</span></p> <p><span>\"Now I am afraid that Mr. Humphrey is in that situation right now.  And I find this deplorable, because the Red Chinese cannot defeat or humiliate the United States.  Only Americans can do that.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"What then, sir, do you see as the likely out-come of this trip?\"</span></p> <p><span><b>'I</b>F YOU remember, Tom, I pledged during the campaign that if I were elected President, the United States would remain number one in the world.  And, you know, if you reflect a little, you find that this really suits the American people, because we are a number one people, we are a do-it-yourself people.  But if, when the chips are down, an American President behaves like a pitiful, helpless giant, the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will be let loose in the world.  And if you think about history for just a minute, you will see that a bad foreign policy leads to the collapse of public spirit and moral standards right here at home.  I can't help but think, though, that Mr. Humphrey had his own re-election in mind when he planned this trip.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Do you yourself have any political plans for the future?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Now you know, Tom, that I would not want to take this occasion as a jumping-off point into politics.  But if the American people find that their leadership is failing them, then it is only natural that they will want to change that leadership.  And it seems to me that, after this trip, the American people will be looking for a new voice, and it may be that they will recognize they want me to become that new voice.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "Groove Tube 2 | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b> VOICE intones, while the Presidential seal flashes on:  \"We interrupt this program for a message from the President.\"  \"I don't want to be in Vietnam,\" the President whines.  \"The Vietnam war...\" --he searches for a perfectly clear description--\"...is like a pebble in my shoe; it's like blowing a wet fart...\"  \"America has balls...\"--again he looks for the perfect phrase--\"...and if any of you out there take offense at that you can go take a flying shit.\"</span></p> <p><span>Ken Shapiro's <i>Groove Tube 2</i> satirizes by rendering the subliminal visible, by making graphic the fears and the personal and institutional dishonesty which everywhere stultify the day-to-day process of living.  If the above joke seems in bad taste, it is because Nixon and the war are, themselves, obscene.  What Shapiro lacks in propriety, he attempts to make up in truthfulness.  The result is an exciting, though certainly not flawless work.</span></p> <p><span><i>Groove Tube 2,</i> the sequel to Shapiro's first Channel One production <i>Groove Tube,</i> presents a series of video-taped episodes over closed-circuit television.  Video Theater reinforces the familiarity of the medium's context by creating a living room-like atmosphere.  Only thirty or so viewers watch each set in the main room and, in the smaller room the audience sits on floor cushions before one large receiver.</span></p> <p><span>The incongruity of these episodes' content with America's usual television fare creates a major source of humor, but television is as much Shapiro's vehicle as his target.  The romanticization of violence and the artificiality of sexuality portrayed on television are properly depicted as symptoms of broader and more deeply rooted individual and social pathologies.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE PRODUCTION'S faults frustrate rather than irritate the viewer because Shapiro's basic failure is not taking fuller advantage of the virtually new medium he so provocatively explores The conventional camera work, reminiscent of television's own too frequent artlessness, occasionally detracts from the experience of watching the show exactly as it detracts from the experience of watching television.  A film essay to the music of \"Gimme Some Lovin'\" is a particular victim of such ordinariness.  Fortunately only a few jokes are predictable in the same way.</span></p> <p><span>Occasionally, Shapiro's unremitting emphasis on sexuality falls flat, blunting once or twice an otherwise deft satirical job.  The sexual overtones of a naked couple's encounter with a fascist Smokey the Bear defuse what could have been a more powerful swipe at the authoritarianism embodied even in the symbol of our national parks.</span></p> <p><span>This question of balance springs from a tension in Shapiro's work, a tension between ideals of consistently hilarious comedy and of valid political and social commentary.  Perhaps the two most insightful portions were the ones which tended least to be bombardments of gag lines, in particular, a mock anti-drug program and another \"message from the President\" on riots in Detroit.  Richard Beltzer, who plays the President as well as other roles, delivers his philippics with a devastating sense of timing.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>THER SCENES, perhaps funnier, evoke laughs because they--and the audience's sensibilities--ignore significant aspects of the issues at hand.  For all Shapiro's revelations on the underlying sexual message of commercial television, he exploits women for laughs just the way advertisers exploit women for sales.  It is likely that the audience, laughing at a newsclip of a press conference at which the President fondles Shapiro, in drag, as India's woman prime minister, felt subconsciously self-satisfied at having not been offended by <i>Groove Tube 2's</i> breach of conventional taste.  It is not likely they would have laughed or felt so entirely sure of themselves had the Prime Minister returned the President's favor, admitting that women have aggressive fantasy-lives as well.</span></p> <p><span>Given these reservations, <i>Groove Tube 2</i> is exciting, not just in its own right, but as a tantalizing hint of what the video medium may yet produce.  Rick Steiner, the owner of Video Theater, who, like Ken Shapiro, began his involvement with films as a child actor, is part of a small group hoping to produce a show for the fall.  Much work is also being done by students who find that video is relatively inexpensive and that video theaters and festivals are springing up around the country.  Popular reception of the new medium as presented in theaters has been encouragingly enthusiastic; the original <i>Groove Tube</i> ran three years in New York before opening for a long run at Boston's Video Theater.  <i>Millhouse,</i> Emilio de Antonio's video production, enjoyed considerable success, probably reaching a broader age group then is likely to patronize <i>Groove Tube 2.</i></span></p> <p><span>There is no denying that <i>Groove Tube 2</i> is often hysterically funny, and that alone should make sitting through an hour and a half's comedy worthwhile.  The humor is incisive and genuinely inventive.  However, while <i>Groove Tube 2</i> is a successful satirical venture in itself, it is even more important as a clue to potentially more radical developments to come.  Shapiro's work--and this represents a sizable achievement--is as challenging in the long run as it is immediately entertaining.</span></p>"}

Roman Hruska, on the occasion of President Nixon's nomination of Harold Carswell to the Supreme Court, that we need more mediocre men in positions of power.</span></p> <p><span>Mr. Epps' passionate analysis is a welcome call to arms for those of us who wish to combat the hordes of summas and magnas who are trying to \"squeeze the life out of us.\"  I have one nagging question, however:  why does he choose to canonize the C student?  Surely if virtue increases positively with distance from Group I, aren't D and E students even more in the state of grace?  I am also slightly puzzled about why Mr. Epps, who was struck with his anti-Harvard revelations back in his freshman year during the Strike, remained for three subsequent years at this institution which he so percipiently recognized as a heartless manufacturer of oppressors (I was not so fortunate to be enlightened early--a senior at the time of the Strike, it proved terribly difficult to unburden myself of the delusion inculcated by four years that my education was worth something).  Perhaps he selflessly devoted his last three years to missionary work among those naive and misguided souls hurtling headlong into the depraved trap of intellectual achievement.  He should in such a case be applauded, since be sacrificed his own purity (certainly his virtue would have been less compromised had he transferred to an unaccredited junior college, or more righteously still, quit altogether and thumbed his nose at academe) that others might be saved.</span></p> <p><span>No, Mr. Epps should not be slighted for failing to follow the logic of his beliefs:  there are few of us so pure that we have not succumbed to the lurid temptation of distinction somewhere along the way.  Rather he is to be congratulated, if not for embodying the mediocrity he so persuasively apotheosizes, at least for pointing out the possibility of salvation to those callow freshmen destined to follow him, by warning them of the ineluctable moral degradation which will infect them should they get an A.  It's not too late for them to flunk out and secure their status as good guys.  Let not the technocratic brutes of the university power structure captiously accuse Epps of paranois, juvenile rantings, or hubris in reverse.

The impression is probably accurate, but the recent bomb strikes against North Vietnam again demonstrate that Nixon's ambition has little to do with any much-heralded peace.</span></p> <p><span>In alleged anticipation of a new Tet offensive, the United States last week launched its most massive air attacks of the year.  Coupled with new fighting in Cambodia and Laos, these attacks belie Nixon's claims of winding down the war.  The Tet offensive--if indeed ever planned--has, in fact, never materialized, and Nixon continues to advertise a bogus timetable for illusory peace, a schedule geared only toward his all too likely reelection.</span></p> <p><span>There can be only two motives for the bombing:  Nixon's hopes of negotiating in China from a position of strength, and his desperate need to appease right-wing hardliners at home.  To support these goals, he continues to sacrifice the lives and property of Vietnames freedom fighters and civilians, and prolongs an immoral struggle against the forces of genuine self-determination in Indochina.  How much of Nixon and Kissinger's revelations on secret negotiations can be trusted should be indicated by Thieu's subsequent reservations and his reiteration of the three \"no's\":  no coalition, no neutrality, and no Communist government for South Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HAT SHOULD be clearest of all is that Nixon's role as peacemaker in China exists only insofar as he can improve the U.S. economic and political position by playing on Sino-Soviet tensions and by deflating antiwar opposition at home.  It is as tragic as it is ironic that a student of John Foster Dulles' foreign policy should be the first American president to visit China in a generation.

{"title": "White Liberal, Black Superman | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HERE is a very short history of films made by committed artists with political intentions.  There are the famous propaganda films--Leal Riefenstahl's <i>Olympia</i> and <i>Triumph of the Will,</i> the early Soviet Union silent classics, the American, \"Why We Fight\" series during World War II.  But films which have dealt with social process in a direct attempt to instruct or instigate change are few and mostly foreign.  Think of <i>Battle of Algiers The Confession If</i> the films of Godard.</span></p> <p><span>The summer however, American critics and audiences began to consider films in increasingly political terms.  The reception of <i>The Candidate</i> made it seem that earlier attempts by Haskell Wexler and Emile de'Antonio had prepared U.S. critics at long last for a film which at least broached contemporary issues.  Even <i>The Trial of the Catonsville Nine</i> a lib-rad pageant released in early June received much kinder treatment from the press due to political leanings which film critics would probably not have generally taken into consideration a few years back.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps more important pop entertainment was politicized by the entrance of blacks into Hollywood genres in some cases constituting acts every bit as political as the more highbrow whites filmed social commentary.  One decent film emerged from the trashleap to become the biggest black but of the year perhaps of them all.  <i>Super Fly</i></span></p> <p><span>In the course of the summer, I had opportunities to interview representatives of most of the mayor political releases Gregory Peck, the producer of Catonsville Nine was the first I talked with and had the least to say.  He decided to back the production, out of a gut level reaction against what was happening in Vietnam if he had personal politics at all they were directed against our totalitarian cultural blandness and could not be specified particularly by the star of Marooned and <i>The Chairman.</i>  Later talks with Jeremy Larner screenwriter of <i>The Candidate</i> and Ron O'Neal, the star of <i>Super Fly</i> did manage to reveal real intentions behind their respective huts.</span></p> <p><span>A note on interview form no matter how you cut, verbatim question and answer is the only way to write one up if the subject is going to be the men of issue at hand, and not the interviewer.  The manner of speech earmarked the man more than the few verifiable facts.  This does not matter as much in intellectual discussions, but the principle, I think, remains the same.</span></p> <p><span>About one month after <i>The Candidate</i> opened in Boston.  I met Jeremy Larner at a small French restaurant on Boylston Street.  As I had given the film an unfavorable review (which he of course disagreed with).  Larher had not been particularly anxious to talk.  But he did, in fact, provide amiable enough.  Looking very much as you imagined Hector Bloom, the Jewish college basketball star of Larner's first novel, <i>Drive.  He said,</i> he spoke with an engaging humor to his edgines, though the presence of a taciturn political friend, who contributed an occasional grunt or mumble and proved invisible otherwise, was slightly discomforting.  The talk began over omelettes.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  How did you first become associated with Redford and Ritchie on The Candidate?</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  Listen, before I answer those questions, let me tell you what I disagree with about your review.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  OK, let's do that.</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  There are some things I agree with, but...\"The filmmakers have not mentioned Vietnam in a vain attempt to reduce the chance of incipient outdatedness...\"</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  You did mention it once.</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  Right, So this is wrong.  But it is not just an attempt to avoid \"outdatedness,\" though it is a serious problem, I don't know why you would take that lightly, for the war could have changed drastically by the time the film came out.  It's really not a film about Vietnam, but certainly some of the things that got us into Vietnam.  And the mention of Vietnam that's there is not insignificant, where what are serious subjects for McKay...are turned into a kind of a joke and kind of offensive and puts him off against the television people a little bit.</span></p> <p><span>Now, You say \"in the process of winning, McKay becomes less of a statesman, but a potent show-biz votegetter;\" I disagree.  He was never a statesman, but he was a person, who was trying to be serious about his life and about his work, and who cared about certain issues.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  Where is this expressed, that he's so serious and living his life so consciously?</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  It may not be well enough expressed, but the fact that he's avoided politics up to now, and the fact that he's running a legal aid office, and his own attitude towards Lucas when Lucas first approaches him.  A good part of the film is spent trying to establish this, whether successfully or not.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  The fact that he's not politically committed doesn't make him a serious person</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  He's suspicious of politics, like a lot of people.  Yet he isn't a profound thinker, he isn't represented as the world's brightest guy.  He's a type who doesn't believe, say necessarily, that elections and politics and taking positions is at all the right way to get things done; he's on to something that's more fundamental, he thinks.  But he's not necessarily an intellectual.  He is, in fact, like a lot of liberal candidates, that is, intuitive, confused, with potentiality to be led by his emotions.  Now you say, \"Whether Ritchie and Larner feel this process necessary, and McKay's actions morally justified, is unclear.\"  Well, I think that that's the most ridiculous statement in the review, no, the second most ridiculous statement.  I think it's crystal-clear whether one thinks this process necessary or his actions morally justified.  We're not moralizing.  We're not moralizing because that would be all too pat to moralize but there's no proof for that in any part.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  No proof</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  Right, there's no part of the film you could point to that would say this process is justified.  We're showing you what the process is, we're also showing you how silly it is and how little it has to do with getting good people to lead us.  To say that...</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  It seems to me what you're doing then, as you've done in your previous points, is merely proving what I think of as limitations in the film.  For example, outdatedness.  If you were thinking in terms of real politics and how audiences could effect things in real situations, you wouldn't have to worry about outdatedness...</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  We're not interested in showing people how they could effect a political situation.  We're making a movie about a certain kind of character in a certain kind of process in a certain kind of situation.  We are not serious in your sense.  We're serious in the sense of being artists.  Artists do not have to solve political problems.  One argument is they shouldn't care.  We're not telling people what to do.  We're showing how this kind of candidate can get elected, totally unprepared to exercise power.  That's not everything but it is alot.  And over the weeks it's gotten very disgusting when high brow reviewers try to pin us with a purpose bigger than we intended...and missing the point of what we were trying to do.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  But it is a real criticism to say that the limits you set yourself are too limited to validate your statement.</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  There's nothing we leave out of the campaign that would happen in a campaign.  He is not pressured on the war in Vietnam any more than he would really be.  You should know what his position would be on Vietnam.  It would be to bring the war to a close...Would it show our moral integrity if we had another scene on Vietnam?</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  It's not really a question of moral interests</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  But you said it was a cop-out.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  OK I say in my sense if I made the film, it would be a cop-out and I do think it's still unclear whether you think McKay's actions justified.</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  Then how could we present these men as being so venal and stupid?</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  If you take that situation as the given you work with and you say that this is what the men have to go through then you say he is morally justified in participating</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  You're saddling us with a theme we do not have.  Given a certain person, this is what happens.  This explains the candidacy of John Lindsay for example.  But it doesn't say something different couldn't happen to another candidate.  It does say, look, this is what happening.  Certainly the implication is we could do a hell of a lot better.  You're confusing art with preaching.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  No.  I'm not, I can point to works of art which a have messages</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  Art doesn't have to preach.  But I think you have to be very obtuse to come out of there that we feel this is necessary.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  If Mckay in the course of the film having been introduced to political chicanery, going through all the whoring and what not you had him go through had say lost.</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  He didn't doe a lot of whoring.  He loses himself in the feedback.  That's important.  It goes against the back room image most people have of politics.  This is what happens in real life.  Most of our politicians are not evil.  In fact, Bill McKay might become an effective senator with a good liberal voting record...But in fact I think it is very clear he loses something as a human being.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  All this is painfully obvious.  But what exactly is he as a human being.  He seems like a nice fellow.  His wife comes across as a very unsavory character but she throws the most serious doubt on his character in the whole film when she says.  You could win if you take it seriously.  We don't know enough about him to know how that registers.</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  That may be a valid criticism.  Look, you say \"in the context of easy ironies that the film presents, in which all men are power-hungry or venal on a solely personal level,\" ...in a sense, all political people are on a personal level, but I think we show relatively idealistic people in this film.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  But not in the political arena...I'm not disturbed that you paint people in politics that way, but I think there may be a level beyond that, where a candidate may recognize the system cynically for what it is, but use it as a tool.</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  That would be great, but that's another film, that's Ted Kennedy.  That's also McKay a little further along, or Marvin Lucas.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  Right, I think he's the hero of the film.</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  You say:  \"I presume that attitude the filmmakers wanted to express was 'this is the way the system works, and if we want to change it from within, we'll have to temper our idealism.'  That's total bullshit.  All the film is saying is this is the atmosphere, these are the pressures.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  Art is reportage.</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  Yes, it certainly is.  We did try to avoid a lot of cliches.  We spent an awful lot of time just on the crowds, the overwhelming feedback.  Just the fact that we choose to show this shows we think this is important.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  Then an important question is \"who are you addressing this film to?\"</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  Not necessarily, not if you don't necessarily think a film is a political act.  I hope everybody sees this.  Everybody could have learned something from it.  The film is a human act.  There are, of couse, compromises, simply on the level that the word \"fuck\" isn't used so we wouldn't get a R rating.</span></p> <p><span>You say we're never sure why McKay goes along with it.  You may be right about that, but we do try to hint at those reasons.  If you just sit there, you'll see a human being who is struggling...he does not have as concrete an ideology as a student, even as a Harvard student.  McKay's downfall is he thinks he can do things his own way.  One of the marvelous things about Lucas is Lucas knows he can't, but dangles this in front of him.  Then McKay becomes trapped.  If he loses, he won't only lose, he'll be humiliated.</span></p> <p><span>Politicans are amazingly weak people.  They can't say no to anybody.  So they get surrounded by people like Marvin Lucas who baby them and manipulate them along.  And very few of them are ideological, though they may give a series of ideological speeches.  They are the kind of people who are very sensitive to how they are coming across.</span></p> <p><span>Q:  At the end of he <b>flim.</b>  McKay is in the Senate.  <b>If you were to make a film</b> The Sena or <b>how do you think  Mckay would act?</b></span></p> <p><span>A:  There's a range of possibilities, I think you would then show him as a much more consciously cynical person.  I don't know that that would make a good film.  I've never considered it.</span></p> <p><span>Actually, I don't think people like Bill Mckay should run for high offices. People who are cleaner.-</span></p> <p><span><b>Q:  What's an example?</b></span></p> <p><span>A:  You may be asking that to find out something about what I'm like as a person, but that doesn't reflect much in <i>The Candidate.</i>  The people I'd like to see in office are not necessarily the ones that would run for office or the ones I'd like to make a movie about.  The best senators are not the most glamorous people, and the best people in the country aren't senators.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q In what sense are you political</i></span></p> <p><span>A I'm a writer.  As a political person, that's a different story.  First of all.  I have a higher obligation as an artist, that in no way cuts against my political obligations, and that's to tell the truth.  That's a simple way of saying something that turns out to be very complicated.  As a political person, my point of view is expressed by <i>Nobody Knows,</i> the book I wrote about the McCarthy campaign, which is that there are very fundamental changes needed in this country, and it's very tricky matter how we go about getting them I'm against a violent revolutionary approach on grounds that it's dangerous, counter productive and immoral.  I believe in democracy for one thing I think as long as there's any chance whatever, you've got to try to persuade people.  I think the McCarthy and McGovern campaign is hopeful, though I'm not pieased with the route his campaign has taken in the last three weeks..To me, there's a big distinction between socialism and communism.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q After the McCarthy experience do you see yourself getting directly involved with a political campaign again\"</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  I get involved in these things now and then out of a sense of obligation.  I just try to make sure that I'm effective.  Mostly, for the last two years.  I've been working on a novel I got involved with the McCarthy campaign by a fluke.  He needed someone, and I was free.  It was a responsibility I couldn't refuse, he was he most hopeful thing happening in this country.  (I was known in certain literary political circles as a \"radical,\" and a friend of mine knew McCarthy and showed him some essays I had written on education in impoverished schools.  McCarhy liked them..)</span></p> <p><span>I was going to quit after the California primary, but stayed on because McCarhy was all we had left.  After California I didn't feel any justification in saying that, with Bobby Kennedy or Eugene McCarthy, one was beer than the other, In retrospect, I'm sorry that Kennedy didn't win and get to be president, though I didn't like how he behaved in the campaign.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  You think he would have been president?</i></span></p> <p><span>A: Oh, I think McCarthy would have, if he tried.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  Did you Robert Redford, and Michael Ritchie share similar political concerns?</i></span></p> <p><span>A: Human concerns, yeah, but Redford and Ritchie are not very political people.  Redford is like McKay in that he distrusts politics and prefers to stay away from them; he's endorsed McGovern, but you won't see him going out and doing the sort of thing Paul Newman did.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  Same incidents in the film have obviously come out of Nobody Knowns.  How much came out of Ritchie's experience with the Tunney campaign.'</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  Some, not as many specific incidents, but Ritchie's feel for what goes on in a make up room before a debate.  The actual dialogue was written by me. We traveled around with Tunney for awhile.  I was also with Unruh, wrote a piece on Unruh and Reagan...Nothing Jarman says in <i>The Candidate</i> hasn't been said by Reagan or Murphy People don't realize how crazy these guys are when they're with their hometown people.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  A major part of the film depicts California, the happiness culture--</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  Right...Ritchie lives in the San Francisco area, Redford's from the Valley, the other side of Low Angeles...California is just an example of what the rest of the country becomes...It's a redundancy to moralize about California, all you have to do is show it.</span></p> <p><span>Most people in California don't think or talk about books and they regard writers as janitors, somebody you have to have.  The things you talk about in L.A. are rock music, movies, and \"where my head is at.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  There seems to be a theme running throughout year work of people with delayed adolescence, grouping for something to hang on to in their lives or professionally...</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  Yes Obviously the social system has collapsed to a degree, leaving a lot of people shipwrecked.  The things people believe in don't work as well in terms of them making a life for themselves, and that's something that does crop up again and again in my writing.</span></p> <p><span>By the way, this is the first time I have defended my film so insistently, because your review expressed what a lot of people felt about the film, I don't think the film is above criticism.</span></p> <p><span>* * *</span></p> <p><span>I spoke with Ron O'Neal under quite different circumstances.  As is often done for stars with commercial prospects, a studio representative and one of Sack Theaters invited a few critics to dine with the star at the suits.  The interview was interspersed with casual conversation and the dining room's piano.</span></p> <p><span>O'Neal is a tall, bag and handsome man who lives in New York but speaks with an educated Midwest accent, unexpected after his portrayal of <i>Super Fly,</i> a live cokepusher named Priest.  O'Neal led off by calling the production the \"definitive black film.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  Have you seen Clayton Riley's piece in the Sunday Times?  Compared to the other black films.  Super</i> Fly <i>came off pretty well, but what he said in general was that all black films subscribe to a sort of black macho ethic which he thought was very crude in which there was a return to the law of the gun and women figure only as sexual pawns.</i></span></p> <p><span>A He's probably absolutely correct, Clayton, you see, fancies himself as the moral and artistic leader of the black artistic community.  He usually states the obvious rather well, in a rather esoteric and involved fashion.  He's very, very bright, but not particularly wise.  Being correct is not necessarily the only thing of worth.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  What good is Super Fly if Riley's criticisms are correct'</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  Go see the film and watch the black audience watch the film.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  In other words, you think it's useful to have black versions of the crude white superheroes?</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  Yeah, but super Fly isn't one of those.  He has a father and a lover, for example.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  I agree as did Riley to some extent Now, if Super Flogets outside the macho ethic in the course of the film, what do you see as his eventual end?</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  He'd have to leave the country, Or else he'd return and be forced back into some hustle or another.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  Then do you agree with Eddie's statement, that hustles like the coke trade are the only way for some bright blocks to get ahead?</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  I would agree...if you are in that certain situation it can seem that way, because it is almost \"the truth.\"  There are exceptions, I think he could be a moyie star.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  Do you enjoy the life?</i></span></p> <p><span>A: I've only had it for three days.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  But you were in theater beforehand.</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  People don't listen to theater anymore.  New York theater taught me one thing:  it's hard but it's fair.  There are no holds learned, no rules.  You've got to be good on your own.</span></p> <p><span>Black producers are the same as white producers. Everyone has his reasons.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  At what level did you get involved with super Fly?</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  The ground floor.  The role was written for me by Philip Fenty, a friend of mine from Cleveland.  After I did <i>The Organization,</i> he was cine president of Creative.  Advertising, very Madison Avenue, and decided he wanted to do films..He thought I was saleable, and I encouraged him.  He finally wrote a script, with my assistance, then he went out and found a producer, Sig Shore.  I never believed for an instant we were going to do this film.  But then we auditioned actors, and selected Gordon Parks, Jr., as director</span></p>"}

It was that kind of scene.  We completed the film, and the next thing I knew Warner Brothers had picked it up.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q: Sig Show was the only white in creative credits.  How involved was he in the film?</i></span></p> <p><span>A. The film would never have been possible without him.  He did directing mostly edited the film.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q: Were there any political arguments and the others.</i></span></p> <p><span>A Not political if Sig and I or Phal or Gorden disputed anything, it would be whether the film was commercial or not.  We learned something from him--he's been in the business 25 years you know.  On the other hand we pulled him into come ideas that with his formula-ridden thinking he didn't think would work.</span></p> <p><span>For instance the relationship between the white girl and Priest.  I would hope that when you saw the trim there wasn't anything offensive about the relationship It would have been eass to put the white girl down strangely enough I was on her side.  You see rust because it was a black him they wanted to do the same thing to that girl as is traditionally tone to black women in white films we came  to a sort of compromise she still something to be avoided.  but an interesting not offensive person who does love Priest It's the Upper East Side world she movies in that stinks for tam.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  will Super Fly be followed up?</i></span></p> <p><span>A There's a very strong possibility.  And a sequel has very potential of being a better film than <i>Super Fly.</i>  We've established our base from which he can mature we don't known what his fullness would be. But there must be a deepening' Super grows which is why he's different from the black film characters.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  What other different are there between him and the others?</i></span></p> <p><span>A I think anyone can agree intellectually with a man who wants to give up dope peddling and get out of the ghetto And the plan he comes up with is quite clever I think You know, a lot of people think the black community is without intellect.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  You seem to think of Priest as some kind of existential hero.</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  Well...the trouble is that this is such an insane country that Priest is really a very common person, at lest from the outside.  A ghetto is an artificial situation, like a laboratory.  You take away so many things, and crowd the people in so, that they do the strangest things.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  The film, according to the press hand-outs, was financed by a host of ghetto figures from \"pushers to dentists, from  madams to businessmen.\"</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  There's some truth in that.  Primarily the film was financed by two black dentists.  We received money from others in small amounts, when we were desperate, from various other people.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  Did you have any trouble with New York City unions</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  We had no trouble, but I have no sympathy with unions.  They've never done a thing for me.  All they do is take dues, and make things expensive to do.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  If Super Fly now relates directly to people in the ghetto how are you going to keep that link as he grows' How would he relate to the black community.'</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  Simply by helping black people in his own way.  Which is something he never did before actively.  He's not one for waving flags or marching or to picket or sit in and that sort of thing.  He's a bon. He doesn't move except with great passion.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  Do you as an artist feel a responsibility to participate in ventures which would aid the black community?</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  I taught theater in Harlem for two year's that's something I put my all behind.  On the other hand I don't think most Americans understand about polities either.  The deals of politics are made over bowls of calm chowder at Howard Johnson's By the time it gets disseminated to us through the papers thought the Vietnam War it's Big Brother time.</span></p> <p><span>Neither Nixon nor McGovern is probably going to match for 125th Street.</span></p> <p><span>But I don't understand why people care what actors think about politicians.  It tells you something about the American political system that people care that John Wayne votes for President Nixon.  It can't be a very sophisticated system.  Now, I thought Adlai Setvenson was a bright man.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  This all says something about culture affecting politics as well People who ride the range with John Wayne might have fantasies to jibe with Nixon promises.</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  Look, the blacks are victims of the much larger problem of America today. We've actually become quite handy to some whites, and most blacks could stay up late dreaming about whites plotting against them.  Actually if it wasn't us it would be somebody else.  The machine keeps grinding.</span></p> <p><span><i>Q:  Just as you said it was important for blacks to have the some cultural whacks as a white macho, wouldn't you want, say, Ron O'Neal to have the same kind of political voice as John Wayne, by the same reasoning.</i></span></p> <p><span>A:  I'm apparently already there, whether I like it or not.  But what the artist should do is define the ethics of a society.  For me, at this point, the Vietnam War carries with it many more moral than political issues. <i>Super Fly</i> is a philosophic moral film.</span></p> <p><span>You know, politics as a subject with black people is a very interesting phenomenon.  The Black Caucus isn't endorsing anyone.  It doesn't concern us We're still building the Black side.  Which ever side it is I'm interested in any film which brings hope, encouragement, enlightenment, pride and warmth or any of the human qualities.  That's all being black is in this country, being a person is--a country determined that you're never going to be a person.  Blacks have to cut against the worst kind of stereotyping.</span></p> <p><span>If change comes anywhere, it will, come in New York.  If someone bumps me on a New York City subway, I know it's not because I'm black, but because my feet are the big.  And individuals can move up quickly in the City.  It's an arena; and the only problem the block man has is that his sword is slightly shorter, and the edge of the sword is not as sharp.  That means you have to have to have a tougher arm.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Harvard Right Makes a Slow Entry Into State Politics | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The miniscule Harvard right frequently obscured by the lush foliage of campus and state liberalism, has shown signs recently of making its first inroads in Massachusetts politics.</span></p> <p><span>In the fourth congressional district, a 30 year old libertarian Harvard graduate student running as a Nixon supporter has thrown one of the state's leading liberals the scare of his political life by turning a \"hopeless\" primary campaign for Congress into a serious challenge.</span></p> <p><span>In eastern Massachusetts, a Harvard sophomore who helped found the New Right Coalition 18 months ago reports that local paid membership has risen above 150 and that the group plans this fall to escalate demonstrations and postering which last Spring inflamed Cambridge tempers over rent control.</span></p> <p><span>At a news conference at Logan Airport last week a Harvard Business School student accompanied by long-haired students and a short-shorn philosophy professor, announced the birth of a Massachusetts Libertarian Party which espouses a number of leftist-sounding causes and is running John Hospers chairman of the Philosophy Department of the University of Southern California, as its presidential candidate.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the sectarianism and vague conflicts in approach these groups and individuals profess a shared belief in Ayn Randian laissez faire capitalism.  And while the climate of Massachusetts appears lethal to their species of political flora the success of similar groups and individuals elsewhere suggests that the new growth may become may become a hardy fixture in ideological forests.</span></p> <p><span>The most significant and professional of the three Massachusetts campaigns belongs to Avl Nelson a doctoral candidate in Physics Running in the Republican primary for Robert F. Drinan's congressional seat.  Nelson has jumped from complete obscurity to what appears to be a photo finish in the four-way primary on Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span>His chief rival.  Ripon society member and state Representative Martin Linsky (R-Brookline), was conceded the race by most observers last Spring due to an established base and close ties to Governor Fransis W. Sargent.</span></p> <p><span>Nelson's leap in the polls--he was a close second to Linsky in a poll published by the Boston globe last month--has been attributed to impressive personal campaigning, the services of a top Nixon political strategist, and a determined media effort.  Volunteer support has come largely from libertarian Harvard and MIT students, and members of the Brookline synagogue headed by his father.  Rabbi Zev Nelson.</span></p> <p><span>The Nelson campaign literature has emphasized the theme that government paternalism and coercion has corroded rights and diminished the lot of productive individuals.</span></p> <p><span>\"I propose to begin by attacking the oversize bureaucracy, the swellen budgets of our regulatory agencies, our exorbitant welfare expenditures, and go on from there,\" his brochure reads.  \"The primary function of government is to protect and guarantee the basic rights which belong to all human beings.\"</span></p> <p><span>Those rights, according to Nelson, are expressed in the concept that \"each individual must have the security to pursue his own goals and values, in peace and without fear.\"</span></p> <p><span>Such positions have been seldom heard in the overwhelmingly liberal Fourth, which resoundingly endorsed the campaigns of McCarthy and McGovern and gave Humphrey's 1968 presidential race landslide approval.  What makes the Nelson showing more surprising still is the handicap of strong competition for the conservative\" vote.</span></p> <p><span>Of the four candidates, only Linsky has a solid record as liberal.  Former Congressman Laurence Curtis, who has outspent all his rivals, holds the Conservative endorsement, while State Rep, Robert A. Belmonte (R-Framingham) carries a reputation for showy patriotism and \"fiscal responsibility.\"</span></p> <p><span>The race, according to a Boston Globe article published September 10 could go any way.  But the article did not exactly downplay Nelson' chances--it ran under the headline \"Three have the background, one has the impact.\"  The one was Nelson.</span></p> <p><span>The New Right Coalition, founded in early 1971 by eight members of Young Americans  for Freedom disgruntled with the organization's conservatism, has seen a similarly surprising rise.</span></p> <p><span>\"We're a national organization now with about 600 or 700 members,\" one of the cofounders, Niel Wright '75 said last week.  \"Most of our members joined after reading about our demonstrations, seeing our posters, or hearing us on talk shows, we stress activism more than most libertarian groups do.\"</span></p> <p><span>One of the more spectacular activities of NRC last year was a attempted filibuster of a rent control law in Cambridge.  Forty NRC members, carrying signs reading \"rent control means people control,\" dominated the microphone at a City Council meeting for three hours while a fuming audience for 1000 chanted obscenities.</span></p> <p><span>Though violence threatened, the filibuster ended without incident after a bomb scare forced evacuation of the hall.</span></p> <p><span>Other NRC rallies have been equally eventful.  A demonstration for \"laissez-faire\" erupted last winter in Harvard Square when street people lit an NRC revolutionary War flag and fled as burning pieces fell on picketer.  On another occasion, two dozen NRC members descended on Welfare Department offices, demanding unsuccessfully to see Commissioner Stephen A. Minter.</span></p> <p><span>The group's pre-eminent claim to fame, however, at least in the Boston area, consists of its prodigious poster campaigns.  It has become almost impossible to walk down any street in Cambridge without encountering posters emblazoned with \"Wanted for Murder--Karl Marx,\" or IRS--Your Money and Your Life,\" or \"Read Atlas shrugged\".  The posters have suffered erosion by angry fingernails and ball point pens, but Wright maintains that they still constitute the group's chief means of advertising.</span></p> <p><span>NRC has targeted several activities for emphasis in Massachusetts this fall.  According to Wright, the organization will hold a leadership conference during a forthcoming weekend, with an expected attendance of 40 or 50, to develop new strategies to increase membership and visibility.  There the group will plan major tax protests, demonstrations against economic controls, and formation of an academic advisory group to develop position papers.</span></p> <p><span>In the meantime, Wright said last week, NRC will prepare new posters and leaflets deploring Nixon and McGovern.  A poster depicting the two candidates on the \"Socialist\" ticket has already begun to make its appearance on Harvard Square lamp poles.</span></p> <p><span>The Libertarian Party, though indistinguishable philosophically from NRC and also very new, has chosen a substantially different strategy.</span></p> <p><span>\"NRC tends to emphasize economic decontrol, \"Paul Siegler, a  second-year student at the Business School and chairman of the Massachusetts Libertarian Party, said last week.  \"We advocate decontrol of social issues with equal stress.  By strongly opposing 'crimes without victims' and legislation of morality, we tend to get a better reception from the left.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Massachusetts party, which formally organized last week with a press conference featuring presidential candidate Hospers, now claims 25 paid members.</span></p> <p><span>In the nine months since its inception, the Libertarian Party nationally has grown to a paid membership of 1500.  Approximately one third characterize themselves as \"free market anarchists,\" despite the Party's limited-state platform, while the rest describe themselves as followers of Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman or Robert Heinlein.</span></p> <p><span>An openness toward the left is also evident in the Party's organizational guidelines, which suggest recruitment of members from the War Resistor's League and the ACLU as well as conservative groups.</span></p> <p><span>The Party's membership diversity and attention to civil libertarianism appear to have produced sympathetic and widespread coverage of the organization by the media.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Village Voice ran a large story about the New York party a few weeks ago,\" Siegler said.  \"They were expecting a group of Jaycees and what they found was quite a surprise.\"</span></p> <p><span>Other major stories have appeared in The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Herald, and The Denver Post, and on network news programs.  \"They usually can't tell whether we're radicals or reactionaries,\" Siegier said.  \"But they admit we're consistently in favor of letting people live their own lives.\"</span></p> <p><span>For the upcoming months, the Massachusetts LP intends to promote the Hospers write-in campaign, host his vice presidential candidate.  Oregon TV journalist Tonie Nathan, form a group of law students to prepare position papers, paste up posters, and work for Avi Nelson.</span></p> <p><span>According to Siegler, the late blooming Massachusetts LP will attempt next year to build a base similar to that achieved in New York, Illinois, Colorado and California.</span></p> <p><span>\"The New York Party has almost 200 members to date who paid $4 or $6 to join,\" he said.  \"They are running two people for congress and one for state legislature.  In California, the LP has even more members has a candidate against Barry Goldwater Jr., and has been allowed editorial rebutals on most of the important radio and TV stations.  Colorado and Illinois both have serious Congressional candidates, and an LP member in Idaho just won the Republican primary for Congress.\"</span></p> <p><span>Despite the fluke in Idaho, virtually no one in the Libertarian Party expects short-run success at the polls.  Siegler and other Harvard members \"The best we can hope to see as a result of our efforts is some realization that 'left' a,d 'right' are poor political terms,\" he said.  \"What we and NRC and people like Nelson are trying to do here in Massachusetts, for all our differences, is say the spectrum should be different.  It should have one endpoint in tyranny and the other in liberty.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Football Team Will Contend for Ivy Title | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last year at this time.  Harvard football coach Joe Restic had a complicated offense imported from the Canadian pros and a lot of confused players left over from the days of the Yovicin sweep-right sweep-left-and-pray-for-the, defense system.  Consequently, Harvard roared out to lose its opener to Holy Cross, a team that had not won a game in almost three years.</span></p> <p><span>By the end of Restic's rookie year, however, his ball club had jelled, and with the aid of such Restic trickery as a quarterback-in-motion play, the Crimson stepped on Yale, 35-16.  Last Wednesday, after two weeks of preseason practice Restic leaned forward in his chair flashed his salesman's smile and chortled.  The systems in.  If Restics players really can understand and execute the complexities of his fat play book.  Harvard will be hot this year On paper at least the Crimson has the talent to a serious contender for the Ivy League title</span></p> <p><span>A lack of clutch plays in crucial situations contributed as much to Harvard's early season losses in 71 as the team's lacks of familiarity with the Restic system.  And unfortunately for the Crimson, the 72 team has lost its most on sistent student clutch player halfback Richie Gatto who is campaigning for McGovern this fall, Gatto's departure casts some uncertainty over what appeared to be a really superb backfield.  Without Gatto, Restic will be forced to start a halfback who suffers from the same inexperience with the Restic system that plagued the Crimson in '71.</span></p> <p><span>Mark Wheeler a transfer student who spent his season of ineligibility learning the opposition's plays to run against the defense in practice will replace Gatto.  Wheeler is faster then Gatto, though, and his credentials are impressive to say the least--he was All-City.  All-State, and All-American in high school, and as a sophomore at the University of Washington in a league considerably tougher than the Ivies, he scored four touchdowns in five games while averaging over four and a half yards a carry.  Restic will also use Nick Leone, a junior track star who showed some good moves early in the '71 season before being hobbled by an injury.</span></p> <p><span>One halfback spot will be held down by Captain Ted DeMars, who has the cutting ability, acceleration, and knack for finding the holes to rate with Yale's Dick Jauron as one of the two best running backs in the League.</span></p> <p><span>Restic's hopes for an explosive backfield have been lampened by an injury to Rod Foster.  Restic finally convinced Foster to give up his quarterback career (with the persuasive arguments of Jim Stoeckel and Fric Crone on his side) and use his considerable running talent as a fullback.  But Foster is nursing an injured ankle, and he has missed the pre-season practice he needed to master his new position.  If Foster isn't ready in time, Restic will have to rely on the shaky ankles and ailing back of Steve Hall a good blocking fullback who saw more time in the last year, or two lesser knowns JV veteran Marc Mayberg and sophomore Phil Allen.  Semor Chuck Krohn a fullback who started the last four games in '71 has quit the team.</span></p> <p><span>The depth chart in a lot more encouraging at the quarterback position Restic is blessed with Jimmy Stoeckel a junior who broke passing records records his first varsity game only to go under the knife two weeks later, and Eric Crone, who came back from as early season injury to blitz the Yale defense in the season finale.  Restic's favorite word, \"flexibility,\" calls for playing time for both quarterbacks.  Each has different talents to offer--Stoeckel is a smart play caller and a good play-action short passer, while Crone is a drop back passer with a rifle arm well suited to the long bomb.  Milt Holt, who threw seven touchdown passes while sharing the quarterback duties on last year's freshman team, has also drawn Restic's praise during preseason practice.  And senior Frank Guerra, a frustrated veteran of three seasons on the bench (and one who may have the best understanding of the Restic system) has not been counted out of the quarterback race.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson put the ball in the air more times than any team in Harvard history, last year.  With a promising new split end on the receiving side, sophomore Pat McInally, the Crimson may well outdo themselves this season.  Restic effusively praised McInally, who may duplicate his record breaking year on the freshman team (eleven TD's an average of over 24 yards per catch), if his six foot six inch, 160 lb frame is not broken in half by a defensive back.</span></p> <p><span>Mclnally is also a long ranger held goal kicker--booted two 19 yarders in high school.</span></p> <p><span>However if any offensive linemen succumb to injuries this season Mclnally Howard Keene and ends will be running pass patterns for exercise while Restic's mans talented quarterback eat the football Restic calls the lack of depth in the offensive line his biggest problem\" Standout tackle Monte Bowens is the only returning starter on the offensive interior line.  Fortunately, last year's second string linemen saw a lot of action under the Restic system of giving under classmen a lot of playing time.  The system made for some unhappy seniors, but now Restic is congratulating himself on his foresight.</span></p> <p><span>Tackis Bit Perry and Tim Manna and guard Bob Kircher all saw more action on the line than either Crone or Stockel did at quarterback.  Restic also has two strong transfers to beef up the line--guard Doug Crim, a sophomore letterman at Indiana and a high-school All-Ohio selection, and center Mike Evans, a 250 lb. former UCLA letterman who was once named \"Player of the Week\" during his sophomore season, and who won the Outstanding Freshman Award during his first year at UCLA.  Two other linemen, guard Mark Bauer and center Steve Snavely, saw about 60 minutes apiece of playing time last year.</span></p> <p><span>If any of his small group of experienced linemen are injured, Restic will have to take a chance on untested and largely unknown players.  With reference to his thin offensive line, he commented last Wednesday that the Ivy League title rests on the weekly question, \"who's injured?\"</span></p> <p><span>The defense has more experience with seven former starters back in the line-up.  Mitch Berger, an All-Ivy selection and an aggressive 235 lb. pro football hopeful, and returning starter Mike McHugh, the fourth leading tackler on the team last year, give Harvard two excellent defensive ends.  The tackle spot will sorely miss All-Ivy Mark Steiner, but two-year veteran Ed Vena, plus Mike O'Hare and Bill Kettlewell, both of whom saw some playing time, should adequately plug the holes.</span></p> <p><span>Middle guard Spencer Dreischarf has graduated, but according to Restic Sandy Tennant and Fred Smith will be more flexible than Dreischarf at playing both inside linebacker and middle guard, as Harvard switches back and forth from five-and-four-man fronts.  Veteran Mark Ferguson returns to inside linebacker with more defensive playing time than anyone except Barger while Jim Westra and Bob Kristoff will provide some linebacking depth.</span></p> <p><span>1971 All-Ivy, team MVP, and Captain Dave Ignacio no longer occupies the rover back position, but his replacement, hard-hitting veteran Steve Golden, should make the most of a rover back's many opportunities to flatten opposing runners and receivers (Ignacio led the team in tackies last year with 60, 19 more than his nearest competitor).</span></p> <p><span>The defensive backfield could be a real source of weakness.  Restic enthusiastically points to a wealth of experience in the defensive secondary, as he has four veterans returning--Barry Malinowski, Mike Murr, Wes Schofner, and Rich Bridich.  But those same veterans provided possibly the worst pass coverage in the League's last year, experiencing such humiliations as a 285-yard day by a single opposing receiver, Doug Clune of Pennsylvania.  Restic attributes the bad days of the pass defense to over-aggressiveness.  He plans to use less blitzing, which left Harvard's slow defensive backs in vulnerable man-to-man situations, and instead lay back in a more cautions zone defense.</span></p> <p><span>Fortunately for Harvard, there weren't many good quarterbacks in the League last year.  However, the Crimson will have to tangle with one of the few really good ones in its League opener against Columbia and the Lions' All-Ivy Don Jackson.  If Harvard's defense doesn't succeed in penetrating the Columbia pass blocking, as it did last year, Jackson and his best receiver, Jeme Parks, may devour Harvard's slow pass coverage.  Restic said the Columbia game \"will pretty much tell you which way we'll go.\"</span></p> <p><span>After years of lurking around the cellar, Columbus looms as a real contender.  The Lions lost only two League games last year, and they handed Darmouth its sole loss on a last-second field goal by their outstanding linebacker, Paul Kaliades, who is perhaps the Ivy's best All-American prospect this year.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately for the Lions, their title hopes come in a year when Dartmouth has the talent and the depth to resume the sole domination of the League and the Big Green Indians enjoyed under ex-coach Bob Blackman.  Last year, Darmouth had to settle for a tie with Cornell, but without almost Hiesman Trophy winner Ed Marinaro, Cornell should fade back into the middle of the pack, despite a good quarterback, Mark Allen, and a great linebacker, Bob Lally.</span></p> <p><span>Yale is the most uncertain commodity in the League.  Although the Elis finished last season with a dismal 4-5 record, they have a lot of enormous linemen returning from injuries have come back to plague them in pre-season.  Yale has switched to the wishbone, releasing Dick Jauron from his fullback duties and perhaps giving him another opportunity to run amuck through the League, as he did as a sophomore halfback in '70.</span></p> <p><span>A mediocre Princeton team his been decimated by graduation.  With the academic departure of Princeton halfback Walt Snickenberger, the Tigers' most experienced back has carried the ball 11 times in varsity action.  Penn, with an experienced defense, some good backs, and receiver Clune, could provide an upset or two.  Despite the loss of outstanding back Gary Bonner, who went the way of Princeton's Snickenberger, Brown should also improve; in other words, it might win a game this year</span></p>"}

She apologized for Senator, nothing that an emergency\" had arisen on the floor of the Senate.</span></p> <p><span>Humphrey, whose deeply lined face makes him look markedly older than be does on television, walked across his office and sat down on the couch.  His appearance was surprising--a sizeable paunch, bloodshot eyes, and hair, which he no longer dyes, the grey hair of an old man.</span></p> <p><span>After he sat down, Humphrey began to discuss the upcoming campaign.  From all appearances, Humphrey will go all out on behalf of the McGovern candidacy.</span></p> <p><span>\"I have about 20 cities that I'm going to for Mr. McGovern.  That was Joe Beirne on the phone just now.  He was complimenting me on my visit to Michigan.  I'm going to Wisconsin.  Tomorrow he wants me to go to Pennsylvania.  Of course in Minnesota.  I took McGovern all around and look him to the AFL-CIO meeting, look him over to the President of our AFL-CIO and we set up a state committee.  I introduced him to all of the audiences there and gave him active support.</span></p> <p><span>\"I am going to California, Ohio, Michigan Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Masschusetts--these are just a few of the states in which I'll be campaigning for Senator McGovern.\"  In spite of the bitter contests he's seen involved with in the last four years, Humphrey has not backed off from what he considers to be the most important principle in party politics when he talks about that principle, it's like a man affirming his belief in religion.</span></p> <p><span>\"Honestly, I have to say that George was not that active for me.  But I think the word \"loyalty\" is a very valuable word, and I hope that young people remember it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Humphrey seems to put his deepest feelings behind his belief in the principles of unity within the Democratic Party, noting that, while he and George McGovern have honest differences, he has no bitterness towards the South Dakota Senator.  Although he considers victory in November a \"highly questionable\" proposition.  Humphrey cited several factors in George McGovern's favor, advantages which he himself did not enjoy in 1968.</span></p> <p><span>\"First of all, I'd just gotten out of the convention on August 30th.  While George had problems from the 15th of July up til now, he had time to get mailings out, to pick state coordinators, to set up labor committees, and to prepare his media--I hadn't done any media by this time.  We came out of the convention a million dollars in debt.</span></p> <p><span>\"Remember, in 1968, the political environment in which we had to operate--the Tet Offensive.  Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination.  Bobby Kennedy's assassination, the McCarthy-Kennedy battles.  Johnson dropping out of the race, the riots at the Democratic Convention--I had to campaign in that atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span>\"George doesn't have these problems this year.  There isn't the harassment in the streets, not only for Mr. McGovern but for anybody.  It's different political environment.\"</span></p> <p><span>Humphrey suggested that the office of the Vice-Presidency was \"some what constricting\" in how he was able to campaign for the Presidency.  Referring to the position as being</span></p> <p><span>Standing in shirtsleeves at his paper cluttered desk, Senator Thomas F. Eagleton (D-Mo) managed a smile as two reporters entered his office.  Two youthful bellbortom-cald aides, followed and took seats directly behind the interviewers.</span></p> <p><span>Eagleton appeared tired and worn.  The exuberant smile of Miami Beach was gone--it was replaced by a forced upturning of the mouth.  His deeply set eyes held a dour, almost mournful image, and his face was noticable taut and lacking in expression.</span></p> <p><span>Thomas Eagleton has become a figure in history, the martyr of election \"72, and while publicly he is wearing such a title with dignity and strength, it was obvious that the events of the last two months had had a profound effect on the character the junior Senator from Missouri.  When he was asked how his recent vacation had been, he repiled, \"Fine, Now let's get going.\"</span></p> <p><span>Eagleton propped his feet up on his desk and took a sip of ice coffee.  An imposing picture of his father, the late Mark D. Eagleton, cast an imposing eye upon the Senator as he spoke of his youth and ventual career in politics.</span></p> <p><span>\"My father was largely responsible for my intereal on politics, although he did not have a preconceived design to thrust me into a political career.  I suppose you could say that I was written by the bug at a very early age Between my father's activities' as a member of the St. Louis Board of Education and his position in Republican politics, I had an early introduction to politics.  He took me to board meetings from the time I was eight and to the Republican convention when I was 11.  Although I was young and didn't always know what was going on the flavor was tantalizing.  I liked the challenge--the combatancy and the competitiveness exited me.\"</span></p> <p><span>Eagleton graduate from Amherst College in 1950 and entered Harvard Law School later that year.  He recalled that though he was a strong supporter of Stevenson in 1952.  Stevenson's supporters were unstructured and disorganized, yet loyal and enthusiastic.  There was no organized activity per se, so I can't say that I took any active political role at Harvard.\"</span></p> <p><span>Eagleton noted that in 1956, when he ran for circuit attorney of St. Louis at the age of 27, his father's initial reaction was negative.</span></p> <p><span>\"As a matter of fact my father tried to discourage me from running and he felt that I should try and establish myself as an attorney first and save politics for later.  Anyway I entered the race and was the youngest man ever elected to that office.</span></p> <p><span>He went on to become the youngest Attorney General in Missoun's history in 1960 and the youngest lieu tenant governor in 1964, a race he won by more than half a million votes.</span></p> <p><span>Missouri politics is know for its tenacious and often dirty political campaigns and Eagleton admitted that he had to downplay his Amherst Harvard background during his early campaign.  Most of Missuri's politicians are educated in state and I can recall several me occasions where opponents tried to criticize me for my Eastern Establishment academic credentials.  While Amherst and Harvard are excellent academic institutions within their own spheres, my schooling was used as ammunition against me, and although I can't say it hurt me, I can't say my New England education helped me with the voters of Missouri.</span></p> <p><span>Eagleton won the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate in 1968, running against the incumbent.  Edward B. Long, and True Daeis, ambassador to Switzerland in the Kennedy Administration.  He won the November election by a 30,000 vote margin while the national Democratic ticket lost the state by 30,000 votes.</span></p> <p><span>Since entering the Senate in 1969, Eagleton has generally taken traditional liberal Democratic positions on issues, voting for end the war legislation and extension of civil rights laws.</span></p> <p><span>In Many of 1969 Eagleton introduced controversial measure designed to permit college and university officials to see injunctive relief in Federal court \"whenever force or the threat of force\" is used to disrupt \"only a spokesman for the Administration,\" he expressed his belief that his creativity and power to affect change, which had brought about far-reaching social legislation throughout his years in the Senate, were stifled in the Vice-Presidency.</span></p> <p><span>\"Obviously, my campaign suffered from all this too.  Also, I truly believe that I was hurt by the press.\"  \"Humphrey seemed disdainful of newsmen, and calls them \"newsies\", \"In September, when I drew 20,000 in Seattle and then 50,000 in Philadelphia, in both cases, the cameras weren't on me or the crowd; they were on the 50 or so demonstrators trying to break up the meeting.\"</span></p> <p><span>While generally known as a spokesman for the \"old guard\" of the Democratic Party, Humphrey acknowledged that the party was in a \"distorted form\" throughout the sixties.  The Minnesota Senator, who became a strong advocate of party reform following his loss to Richard Nixon, and who helped found the McGovern Commission in 1969, stated his qualified support for the Commission's guidelines.</span></p> <p><span>He recognized that there were practices in effect over the past years sometimes prevented\" large numbers of young people inorities, and women from taking and active role in the Party.</span></p> <p><span>\"The changes that we made from '69 to '72 were based on the theory that you must go on out and bring people into the Party, and the only way to do this was to set quotas.  Now I generally don't like quotas; I think they're undemocratic.  I think they tend to build more friction than harmony over the long period of time.  But, even though I don't think we should have quotas next time, I think the price we paid was worth it, and, in the long run, we'll have a better political party.\"</span></p> <p><span>Humphrey said that he would recommend to the Democratic Reform Commission that they do away with the \"strict kind of percentage system\" that was used in the selection of delegates to this year's Democratic Convention.</span></p> <p><span>Though Senator Humphrey expressed his approval of the Nixon Administration's troop withdrawal program in 1969, he said that his greatest opposition to President Nixon right now comes from Nixon's handling of the war in southeast Asia.</span></p> <p><span>Referring to the President for the first time as \"Nixon\", Humphrey stood up to show the personal hurt he felt from Richard Nixon's management of the war:  \"He said he wanted to be judged and held accountable for his actions in getting us out of the war.  He said he'd have us out in six months.  He won an election on that!</span></p> <p><span>\"He won that election from <i>me</i> and he told the American people that he was going to get out of that war and he's still in it.</span></p> <p><span>\"Sure, he's taken out troops.  But we've increased the amount of air power, we've increased the amount of naval power, we've increased the amount of fire power.  And I think the President did not keep his word.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"It's bad enough for him to say that there would be no rise in unemployment and that inflation would be brought under control--this I suppose you could say is some what political.  But when the war was the key issue, it was the thing, I'm sure that won for him--the promise that we'd be out of there.</span></p> <p><span>\"He hasn't kept that promise And I don't like it.\"  In his own office.  Humphrey showed a degree of outrage of the war, and a depth of committment against it that had never shown in his campaign It is a side of Hubert Humphrey that he seems unable to communicate on television.</span></p> <p><span>Discounting reports that many of his former supporters were jumping on the Nixon bandwagon, Humphrey said that the anti-McGovern feeling among disaffected Democrats will soon subside.</span></p> <p><span>\"When the chips are down, we're all Democrats.  George McGovern is our nominee, and my idea is that you pull the team together and go to work.\"</span></p> <p><span>A buzzer sounded in his office, the buzzer that tells every senator that an important vote will be taken on the Senate floor in five minutes.  Humphrey stood up, straightened his tie, and strode confidently out of the office, down the marble hallway, with an aide trailing behind</span></p>"}

Hall, vice president for Administration, said he expects further action this winter.</span></p> <p><span>The mammoth 35-story plant would cover a two-block area and provide steam, electricity and chilled water for air conditioning at roughly half the price currently charged by Boston Edison.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Mass Hall Decisions</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Just as the summer began, less than a week after the last Spring term exams, the Committee on Rights and Responsibilities (CRR) came to a decision on two controversial cases.</span></p> <p><span>On June 7 the CRR and two other University disciplinary bodies ruled that none of the 34 black students who participated in the week-long occupation of Massachusetts Hall last April will be required to withdraw from the University.</span></p> <p><span>In simultaneous announcements, the CRR and the disciplinary committees of the Law School and the Divinity School said that special circumstances surrounding the occupation ruled out strong punishment.</span></p> <p><span>The 34 students had occupied Mass Hall from April 20 to April 26 to protest the University's decision to retain its 700,000 shares of Gulf Oil Corporation Stock.  The students had demanded that Harvard sell the shares because of Gulf's involvement in the Portuguese colony of Angola.</span></p> <p><span>The CRR-which decided the cases of the 32 occupiers studying under the Faculty of Arts and Sciences--unanimously voted to give suspended requirements to withdraw for one term to all of the students.  The only effect of the sanction is to give each of the students a record of disciplinary action, thus making stronger penalties more likely in the event of future offenses.</span></p> <p><span>The CRR decided against a tougher sanction even though it unanimously ruled that the occupation was a violation of the Resolution on Rights and Responsibilities.  \"Building occupation has been deemed and still remains an unacceptable form of protest,\" the decision said.</span></p> <p><span>However, the CRR cited several special circumstances--including the non-violent nature of the occupation and the lack of previous disciplinary records for any of the students--which it said prompted the decision of the committee against more severe punishment.</span></p> <p><span>Responding to the decision two days later, President Bok said that \"a\" number of problems\" have arisen because of the mildness of the punishments.</span></p> <p><span>Although Bok did not clearly condemn the decision, he said:  \"A particularly serious problem is whether the orderly functioning of the University is adequately protected by a apparent precedent that building seizures, however prolonged, will not result in substantial disciplinary action if no violence to persons or property occurs and the persons involved have no prior disciplinary record.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bok concluded by calling for a \"careful consideration by the University's faculties\" of the disciplinary problems.</span></p> <p><span>In a veritable whirlwind of activity, the CRR came to another decision a week later.  This time the decision was more severe.</span></p> <p><span>The committee voted to require Bonnie E. Blustein '72, a long-time SDS member, to withdraw from the University three days before she was scheduled to graduate.</span></p> <p><span>Blustein, who was ordered to withdraw for one year, was found guilty of violating the Resolution on Rights and Responsibilities by participating in a six-hour occupation of the Government Department's offices in the Littauer Center on May 10.</span></p> <p><span>The CRR explained the harshness of the decision against Blustein was because of her prior disciplinary record.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Heimert Studies Grads</i></b></span></p> <p><span>The graduate students took vacations from their research, teaching and protest this summer, but the University didn't forget them or the controversy they stirred last Spring over Staff Teaching Scholarships.</span></p> <p><span>A six-member task force of professors, headed by Alan E. Heimert '49, Cabot Professor of American Literature, early in August began a re-examination of the role of teaching during graduate study.</span></p> <p><span>Heimert said the committee would study the relationship between reaching and doctoral work \"to find a sound educational basis for the use of teaching fellows:\"  A separate committee was established later in the month to examine the financial issues.</span></p> <p><span>His task force will send its report to a larger investigating commission to be established this Fall.  The Fall commission was mandated by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences last Spring after the Graduate Student--Teaching Fellow Union protest.</span></p> <p><span>Although the Fall commission will include graduate students, the summer task forces did not.  \"I guess the administration has decided it can afford to do this work without us,\" commented Dov Ospovat, a member of the Steering committee of the' Union.</span></p> <p><span>But Barbara Herman, another, Steering Committee member, said she doubted that union members would have worked with the task force even if asked.</span></p> <p><span>\"That's not the relationship we were interested in--gathering information for someone else's investigation,\" she said.  \"The object was to start fresh with the graduate students and find out what the problems are.\"</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Popkin Still Waiting</i></b></span></p> <p><span>The case of Samuel L. Popkin, assistant professor of Government, continued to drag on this summer, and looked no closer to conclusion in September than it did at school's closing last June.</span></p> <p><span>Popkin is appealing a contempt of court citation for refusing to answer certain questions before a Boston Federal Grand Jury investigating the Pentagon Papers case.</span></p> <p><span>The bulk of the summer's case revolved around a request by Popkin's attorneys that the Justice Department officially disclose the details of any wiretapping or electronic surveillance of Popkin.</span></p> <p><span>The Justice Department has yet to respond to a court order requiring it to produce evidence that it has not tapped Popkin's telephone.</span></p> <p><span>Assistant U.S. Attorney Warren P. Reese, the chief prosecutor in the Boston investigation, issued a curt \"no comment\" when asked what was taking so much time.</span></p> <p><span>\"We are not allowed to answer any questions on the investigation of the Pentagon Papers.\"  Reese said.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Radcliffe Gets Richer</i></b></span></p> <p><span>University presidents have been lamenting about hard financial times for several years, but this year alumni seem to have responded to the cry.</span></p> <p><span>The nine University gift funds together received more money last year than ever before and three of the nine set individual records.  Donations to Radcliffe showed the most spectacular increase--a 50 per cent jump over last year's figure.  Harvard College and the Law School Funds also received record donation.</span></p> <p><span>Private benefactors altogether gave $7,441,238 to the University funds--topping last year's record cache by over $850,000.</span></p> <p><span>Yet in spite of record-breaking donations in 1971, University income fell $1.4 million short of expenses, and David W. Davis, consultant in the Office of the Financial Vice President predicted this year's record donations would not balance this year's budget either.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>House Films Endangered</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Students looking forward to returning to Harvard's usual weekend choice of ten $1 film favorites may find movie pickings slimmer and more expensive this Fall.</span></p> <p><span>The University Council this summer canceled the student-run University Film Society's summer series of popular classics, setting a precedent which may result in a drastic change in this Fall's House film showings.</span></p> <p><span>The cancellation came less than two weeks after the University had approved the entire 27-film series, to be shown in Emerson Hall.</span></p> <p><span>The films were cancelled because they violated an agreement made last Spring between some of the Harvard student film society and local theatres.  That agreement limited student films to intellectual and esoteric movies which would not compete with local theater shows.</span></p> <p><span>However, the agreement was only tentative and not binding.  Several film societies--each as the Quincy Cinema Guild and films Across the River which show popular classic--did not even participate in drawing up the guidelines.</span></p> <p><span>The real reason behind the series' sudden death may have been threats from local theatre proprietors that a continuation of a 99-cent.

Peretz as a symbol of the major money sources behind the presidential campaign of Senator George McGovern.</span></p> <p><span>In a sharply worded, nationally syndicated column that appeared the week of August 20, Alsop said that McGovern's campaign coffers were filled to the point of bulging with \"Peretz money\"--a term he coined for funds coming from rich, leftleaning McGovern supporters who, according to Alsop, \"had nothing to do with normal Democratic money\".</span></p> <p><span>Alsop said that \"Peretz money\"--and not the thousands of small contributions that McGovern staffers cite--has been the principal source of financing in the Democratic presidential drive.</span></p> <p><span>Peretz called the column \"one of the silliest things I've ever seen.\"  Peretz said the article had nothing substantial to say, and was simply a reiteration of Alsop's claim that the Democratic Party is about to be taken over by left-wing irregulars.</span></p> <p><span>\"It seems he would prefer that the Democratic Party be funded by Government contractors,\" Peretz said.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Transfer Rate Slides</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Coeducational gains were prospective transfer students' losses, it was learned this summer.  Harvard and Radcliffe reduced the number of transfer students accepted by 60 per cent in order to compensate for increases in the number of freshman women.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard accepted 16 transfer students, less than 2 per cent of approximately 1100 applicants.

{"title": "Cambridge Academics Waver on McGovern | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>HILE MANY HARVARD and MIT professors who traditionally back Democratic candidates are now supporting the McGovern-Shriver ticket, there seems to be a substantial number who are sitting on that fence.</span></p> <p><span>Seymour Martin Lipset, professor of Government and Social Relations, formerly an active supporter of democratic socialist policies, is not supporting McGovern and is officially uncommitted.</span></p> <p><span>Lipset has described McGovern's supporters in the University community as \"mushhead intellectuals.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"They are the types of people who can get goals but don't really have the hardheadedness to formulate plans to achieve them,\" he said last week.</span></p> <p><span>He was also wary of McGovern's proposed reduction in the Defense budget.  \"If we cutdown our production of conventional weapons in the way that he wants to,\" Lipset argued, we will be placed in the situation of either having to back down or use nuclear weapons if we have a confrontation with the communists in the Mideast or in Asia.  McGovern's proposals would bring us one step closer to World War III.\"</span></p> <p><span>Lipset, who is spending this year at the Center for Advanced Behavioral Research in Palo Alto. Calif., is equally disturbed about McGovern's original base of support.  \"McGovern's early supporters were attracted to him over the sex business, abortion, and marijuana legalization.  Essentially his campaign in the early primaries was like a small third party movement,\" he said.  \"Now with McGovern retreating from his early positions, he's lost much of his early backing plus having trouble getting the traditional elements in the Democratic party to support him.\"</span></p> <p><span>At a meeting of the American Political Science Association last week, Lipset presented data he had collected on the percentage of college professors supporting President Nixon and McGovern.  He stated that 46 per cent were backing McGovern and 43 per cent were supporting Nixon, with the rest undecided.</span></p> <p><span>Daniel P. Moynihan, professor of Education and Urban Politics, who played a major role in John F. Kennedy's victory in New York State in 1960, wrote an article in the September 1 issue of Life magazine on how President Nixon views his second term in office.</span></p> <p><span>Moynihan, who was an advisor in the Nixon Administration as well as in those of Kennedy and Johnson, has drawn fire from both columnists and fellow Harvard professors, who contend that Moynihan glorified Nixon and that Moynihan made poor arguments to justify his contentions.</span></p> <p><span>Joseph Kraft, in a syndicated column appearing in The Boston Globe on September 11, charged that Moynihan was repeating \"utter nonsense\" in hope of \"finding favor\" with the White House.  He wrote that Moynihan did not use valid evidence to prove his assertion that Nixon was against quotas when Moynihan cited the large number of Jews with high Administration posts.</span></p> <p><span>James Wechsler, a columnist in.  The New York Post, charged in an August 30 article that Moynihan interchanged his own thoughts for Nixon's specifically when Moynihan wrote that Nixon is dreaming \"of a new coalition not built on fears, but built on common hopes.  He sees as its unifying principle not total agreement or even substantial agreement about the particulars of program and policy, but rather recognition of the need for civility in working out ways to approach the great goals of the society.  As he sees it, the Stevensonian concept of civility is accessible equally to persons north, west, south, east, black, white, yellow, young, old.\"</span></p> <p><span>Wechsler also questioned Moynihan's article because it contained no direct quotes from the President.</span></p> <p><span>Martin Kilson, professor of Government, in a letter to Life dated September 10 charged that \"Moynihan's equation of the new (second) term Nixon with the late Adlai Stevenson is one of the most extraordinary manipulations of truth for political ends I have seen in some time.  Intellectual huckstering has, alas clearly entered a new era.\"</span></p> <p><span>When asked to comment on these charges last week, Moynihan seemed unmoved.  All I did was report what the President had to say.  People may not like it, but that's all that I did,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>\"If people find the reasoning in the articles faulty they are entitled to, but they're not my arguments, their the President's.\"</span></p> <p><span>Moynihan explained that he had used no direct quotation simply because there is a Presidential rule against the President granting interviews.\"  Of course exceptions are made to the rule, but in this case all that I did was take notes on what the President said,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>\"I am a registered Democrat in Cambridge and I am not taking an active role in this campaign for anyone.\"</span></p> <p><span>It is not quite clear what Henry Kissinger's role will be in the upcoming campaign, but one thing is sure:  the Committee to re-Elect the President isn't telling.</span></p> <p><span>Jon Schumley, director of public affairs for the committee, said Kissinger's role \"will be\" to chair the National Security Council.  We have no schedule for him and we don't anticipate his making any appearances.\"</span></p> <p><span>He refused to comment on whether Kissinger would be used to help raise funds at gatherings of wealthy Jews, as he did during the summer.</span></p> <p><span>Professors on the Democratic side are more active.</span></p> <p><span>Abram J. Chayes, professor of Law, may be the most active of McGovern's Harvard advisors.  He said last week he has been working full time on the campaign since the convention.  Dubbed by many people the \"Secretary of State\" or the \"Kissinger\" of McGovern's advisers, Chayes is overseeing almost all of the Democratic presidential coatender's foreign policy research.</span></p> <p><span>Chayes has organized about 90 professors into nine task forces to study all areas of the world and topics such as development, the U.N. and financial affairs.  \"A lot of people wanted to be involved in the campaign and this is a good way to put their talents to use,\" Chayes said last week.</span></p> <p><span>The Eastern Liberal Establishment seems to be highly represented in the group.  Chayes said most of the professors are from the East Coast and about one-fourth are from the Boston area.</span></p> <p><span>\"A lot of people have objected to the geographical concentration and thought we should spread out to get different points of view,\" Chayes said.  But he added that the great number of academicians from the area was natural:  \"There is a population concentration here, there is an academic concentration here, and here are the people I know and have confidence in.\"</span></p> <p><span>Chayes recently went on a two week fact-finding mission for McGovern in Western Europe and Israel, where he said he got \"royal treatment.\"  He said the Israelis he talked to--including Prime Minister Golda Meir, Foreign Minister Abba Eban, and Defense Minister Moshe Dayan--had none of the apprehensions about McGovern's position on Israel that newspapers report are sending many American Jews to the Nixon camp.</span></p> <p><span>Chayes said most of his work for the campaign is behind him and the task force reports on foreign policy should be done soon.</span></p> <p><span>Edwin Kuh, professor of Economics at MIT and Stanley  Surrey, Smith professor of Law were instrumental in the drafting of McGovern's revised economic proposals.  Paul Samuelson, a colleague of Kuh's worked with him on the draft, but has not been as active in this campaign as he had been in the past for Democratic candidates.  \"I'm working on the ninth revision of my textbook now no I really don't have the time to be as active as I was for Jack Kennedy,\" Samuelson said.  \"I'll probably confine my activities to talking to financial groups to reassure them about McGovern's policies.\"</span></p> <p><span>Marc Roberts, assistant professor of Economics, has been working with McGovern since last February.  Before the New Hampshire primary, Roberts drafted position papers on the environment and on corporate responsibility.  He subsequently went to California before the primary, to work on developing an alternative peacetime budget for the state.  After the \"primaries, Roberts went to Washington to work on the platform and assisted in drafting planks on the environment and corporate responsibility.</span></p> <p><span>Roberts is now working on another white paper for McGovern on the environment.</span></p> <p><span>While not directly connected with preparing McGovern's economics program, Roberts periodically offered advice to McGovern aides working on revising the plan.  In an interview last week, Roberts explained why it took so long  to revise McGovern's original tax reform plan which came under attack in the middle of May and was not revised until the end of August.</span></p> <p><span>\"In order to do this we had to run a computer simulation of the entire economy which takes a good deal of time,\" he explained.  \"In addition we had to weigh the political question of how large a tax base we want to use.  Each time McGovern's political advisers made a change, we had to do a new simulation.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "A Republican Roadshow Swamps Miami | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>MIAMI BEACH--Party leaders and delegates to the Republican National Convention spent many uncertain moments have last month reminding themselves that there was, in fact, a reason for their being in Miami Beach.</span></p> <p><span>It was billed as a nominating convention.  Instead, Miami Beach Convention Hall was transformed into a huge studio in which the Republicans unsheathed their 1972 campaign strategy and paid tribute to their incumbent President before a prime-time television audience.</span></p> <p><span>The delegates were merely actors in the unsuspenseful drams.  Three thousand Young Voters for the President played a crucial supporting role.  The powerful elite which steers the Republican Party spent four days directing producing and orchestrating the gala event--gala, this is, if the proper credentials and invitations to lavish afterhours parties were obtainable.</span></p> <p><span>For most people, those credentials and invitations were well out of reach.  In Flamingo Park, 4500 uninvited and unaccredited non-delegates--mostly young--plotted to disrupt and embarrass the Republicans.  They sought to confront President Nixon once more over his policies of Vietnamization negotiated settlement and bombing in Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>But even the protesters were swept under by the supra-efficient planning which fused the Republican's gathering in Miami Beach.  Their goal of forcing the President to deliver his acceptance speech before a half filled auditorium seemed an improbable one at the outset; its chances for success diminished steadily as internal dissension over tactics of violence and non-violence split the demonstrators.</span></p> <p><span>Then, too, there were the police who had stood by in ponderous numbers for the Democratic Convention only six weeks earlier.  Their ability to strike quickly and effectively had not diminished; during the final two days of the Republican Convention, they arrested over 1400 persons, dutifully photographing and booking each one and advising them of their rights.  The streets outside Convention Hall were thick with crowd-control gas, but inside, Richard Nixon addressed an overflow audience which embraced him with unabashed warmth.</span></p> <p><span>It could not have gone better for the Republicans, even the street disturbances which injected a smattering of spontaneity into an otherwise preordained scenario.  For three days, Republican leaders had been praising Richard Nixon as a man of warmth, moderation and sensibility.  They had called out to discontent Democrats to join the Nixon bandwagon.  Most of all, they had created a strained comparison between the clean-cut, exuberant, All-American kids tagged Young Voters for the President and the long-haired, dungareed McGovernites who had filled Miami Beach six weeks before.</span></p> <p><span>The logical extension of this comparison was that the protesters in Flamingo Park were also McGovernites.  So it was that the trouble on the streets fit perfectly into the scheme, complimenting the written script which timed every demonstration, every burst of applause, every \"spontaneous\" resolution from the floor inside Convention Hall.  The delegates made it inside with a minimum of obstruction, the cameras were focused on the President as he again accepted the nomination of his party, and outside, as the media would dutifully report afterwards, police were sweeping 1200 unruly demonstrators of the radical left into Miami's jails.</span></p> <p><span>Those who witnessed the Republican Convention last month came away with a taste of tactical politics extraordinaire.  The Republican were impressive not for their departure from tradition, as the Democrats had been in July, but for their adherence to the strictest guidelines of party politics.  They sought to reinforce an already wide lead in Presidential polls, to coalesce unlikely allies into an unbeatable force designed to propel Richard Nixon back to the White House with something he has never won in a Presidential race--the vote of the majority.</span></p> <p><span>The scripted deification of President Nixon reflected the political acumen of men like Senator Robert Dole (R-Ken), the chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Clark MacGregor, John Mitchell's successor as head of the Committee to Reelect the President.  It pivoted on the tremendous funds which these men have at their disposal.  A $44,000 podium designed for maximum television exposure, the most sophisticated electronics ever employed at a political convention, a series of documentary films highlighting the President, his family and his party--it was a staggering example of what money can buy and of how well-financed media presentations can influence the electorate.  Moreover, it was an amplified revival of the strategy Joe McGinniss' described in his book on Nixon's 1968 foray.  \"The Selling of the President.\"</span></p> <p><span>The five sessions of the Republican Convention were conceived as the initial thrust of a coalition campaign.  Timed to the split second, the Convention worked around several themes bringing in Democratic centrists and conservatives by appealing to bygone days of unity, stalking the youth vote previously conceded to Senator George McGovern, and mounting a fear of what McGovern might do if elected President.</span></p> <p><span>So it was that Senator Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz), the conservative Republican nominee of 1964 who suffered the worst defeat in electoral history, was shifted out of prime time because he refused to tone down a speech attacking not just McGovern, but the Democratic Party.  While he waited in the wings, the name of his opponent.  Lyndon B. Johnson, drifted through Convention Hall along with those of other prominent Democrats, ranging from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Harry Truman to Richard Daley.  And much like expatriates paraded before the Old Country's press.  Democrat after Democrat was brought forth to confess conscience-rending decisions to cross party lines and support the President.  George McGovern was just too radical.  Two Democrats for Nixon were even included among 11 seconds following the President's renomination speech by another old foe,' Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York.</span></p> <p><span>The singlemindedness among Republicans of every persuasion was the mark of the 1972 Convention.  After 12 years of frustration, they hold a position of strength sufficient to cause astute political observers--including James Reston, the foremost observer--to devote thought to the prospect that the Republican Party could become the dominant, if not majority, party after November.  The Republicans sought to seize the moment and exploit it to the utmost.  Somehow, though their efforts came across only as exploitation.  They lacked the genuine touch which permeated Miami Beach during the Democratic Convention.  And whether they really do seek progress or not--a question left unsettled by their Convention behavior--the Republicans have backed into a campaign which will pit the slick media front born of big money against the grass-roots tactics of a hazily-etched, emerging political camp.</span></p> <p><span>Comparisons between the Republican and Democratic Conventions are inevitable because the differences between the two crystallize November's election choice.  It is unfair to pan the Republicans for the absolute control and staging which distinguished their gathering, on for their blatant appeals to dissident Democrats.  Shrewd politics win elections, and the two sure precedents for the Republicans' tactics are found in Democratic campaigns.  Franklin Roosevelt exercised broad control over the 1936 convention which renominated him, and Lyndon Johnson did likewise in 1964.  The Republicans of 1972 departed from these Democratic forerunners, though, because they were not confronted with immediate crises.  Roosevelt guided a country steeped in depression.  Johnson sought to reunify a nation still reeling from the assassination of John F. Kennedy less than a year earlier.  But these Republicans in Miami Beach aimed only at buttressing a partisan bid for continued dominance--not just in 1972, but for years beyond.  And in this effort, they resorted to the canned ballyhooing and poorly disguised appeals of a party which consciously shifts its base to achieve parties goals.  August 1972 does not hold fast when contrasted with the genuineness of Miami Beach in July 1972.  It is instead a picture of superficiality and false initiatives.</span></p> <p><span>The central theme of the Republican Convention was that it was the \"Open Door\" convention, a convention based not on quotas but on the justice of a proven political process.  The President struck home in his acceptance speech:  \"You (the delegates) have demonstrated to the nation that we can have an open convention without \"dividing Americans into quotas ... the way to end discrimination against some is not to begin discrimination against others.\"</span></p> <p><span>Yet for those in Miami Beach who could not penetrate the Republican's security canopy, the city was a succession of locked doors and edgy security agents.  The Republican platform was refined behind closed doors under the auspices of White House directives; the hotels where the Republican National Committee and the President's staff were housed were sealed off, preventing any and all persons superfluous to the business being conducted therein from entering; every public reception and welcome for Party dignitaries was peopled by carefully screened youths and Party regulars, leaving no chance for antiwar protesters to man the proceedings.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, those who controlled the Republican Convention spared no effort to present a unified front.  But while they succeeded to that end, Republican leaders left unanswered for the American public the question of how representative their convention actually was.  They discarded the sole challenge to their master scheme in a resounding defeat, voting down by a 910 to 434 margin the Steiger Amendment for reapportioning delegate distribution at the 1976 Convention.  They vowed not to succumb to quota representation:  at auspicious moments, they passed before the cameras a sampling of youth, women and minorities to prove their \"Open Door\" policy, but they failed to provide for enlargement of those groups four years hence.  In doing so, the Republicans seemed to say that in 1976, and for the forseeable future, their party will be one whose trademarks are black limousines, Pucci ties, and 45-foot yachts lined up 85 in a row to \"honor\" the Party's Presidential candidate.</span></p> <p><span>The contrast between the Republican Convention and that of the Democrats in July transcends political beliefs--it goes beyond a platform for or against forced busing, beyond immediate withdrawal from Indochina, beyond tax structures--even though those beliefs are the foundation of November's choice.  The contrast lies too in the Democrats' open platform hearings; in the uncordoned lobby of the Doral Hotel; and, in the movement of candidates and their staffs hustling for delegate votes and bargaining power.  Most clearly, it lies in the composition and altitude of delegations.</span></p> <p><span>The Doral Hotel, guarded like a fortress by Secret Servicemen last month, was McGovern headquarters in July.  For the presence of the White House staff in August--not the President, the Vice President, nor their families--Doral guests and employees were required to wear identification badges at all times, even when sunning beside the hotel's private pool.  For Bob Haideman and Herb Klein and Clark MacGregor, paper shredders were installed at the Doral, and the hotel lobby was closed to conventioneers.  It was the same lobby where in July, anyone could come and go, anyone could hitch a ride to Convention Hall, anyone could mingle with McGovern staff members or catch a glimpse of the candidate, and where 400 SDS members could sit in protest for six hours until McGovern himself came down to meet with them.</span></p> <p><span>It was just this kind of protest which the Republicans avoided and, when necessary, counteracted like a malignant tumor.  Their trump card was the 3000 Young Voters for the President (YVPs), who were invited to Miami Beach at their own expense to provide a roving cheering section for the Republican cause.  These \"representative youths\" dressed right, smiled a lot, concocted homemade campaign placards, spoke to the media whenever possible, and practiced cuing in Convention Hall.  A mimeographed directive instructed the YVPs to cheer whenever youth was mentioned, whenever victory in November was mentioned, whenever victory in November was mentioned, whenever the President or the First Family was mentioned, and on and on.  They were bused to the airport to greet the President, while a group of Vietnam Veterans Against the War was halted at the entrance to the field.  They rallied 8000 strong on the night President Nixon was renominated so that they could hear Sammy Davis Jr., a Democrat, and then the President tell America, as they applauded wildly, that \"you have made us realize that this is a year when we can prove the experts' predictions wrong because we can set as our goal winning a majority of the new voters for our ticket in November.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nixon laid out the bogus comparison himself:  \"I express the appreciation of all of the delegates and of all America for letting us see young America at its best at our convention.\"  The implication was that while the youth on the streets outside Convention Hall were young America at its worst, the McGovern forces were not far behind.</span></p> <p><span>It was a classic misconception for the President to foist, but a misconception it was.  For the young peoplv at the Democratic Convention, working not just for McGovern but for Humphrey and Jackson and Muskie, displayed seriousness of purpose which outreaches imagination.  They concentrated imagination.  They concentrated political thought, they seemed to know every twist and turn of the platform and of impending floor fights over rules and credentials.  They were delegates and staff members, not cheerleaders.  They didn't prim and prance for television, preferring instead to strategize about the business before the Convention.  And they spent four long nights trying to put those strategies to practice.</span></p> <p><span>By comparison, the YVPs were mindless hordes.  While some expressed disappointment that they did not assume parts more closely tied to the work of the Convention--parts which seemed implicit in their invitations from the Republican National Committee--most accepted the cheerleader's role and were content to emulate the ways of their wealthy elders.  Few could detail the platform or explain the intricacies of the Steiger Amendment.</span></p> <p><span>This same mindlessness extended to Republican delegations.  They voted as they were instructed to vote.  No one dared to bolt from the fold--indeed they would not have been in Miami Beach in the first place if they did dare--and their week was one of idle frustration.  Everything was settled before they arrived.  Their role was predetermined and precisely scheduled.  They fit neatly into the scenario, but beyond a certain point they became unneeded.  For a small delegation there were no parties at luxurious Miami Beach homes, no visits with Party bigwigs.  There was only a mid-priced hotel and five perfunctory sessions at Convention Hall.</span></p> <p><span>It is impossible, really, to fault delegates in this predicament for not boning up on the political significance of the platform.  But it is ludicrous to presume, as the Republican Party would have America presume, that these delegates were more than fixtures.  The comparison between the Republican and Democratic Conventions was so stark that the Republican theme of an \"Open Door\" convention dissolves into fantasy at the most cursory examination.  Only tangential events like the aimless violence in Miami Beach's streets and bodily assaults on delegates could give credence to this theme by providing reason for a multitude of closed doors.</span></p> <p><span>So it was that the outworn tactics of a violent fringe made the Republicans' doors appear open to the American public.  And through those doors they viewed the first vestiges of Richard Nixon's reelection campaign.  Just as in 1968, he has gone on the offensive, pandering to carefully chosen audiences, manipulating the media, revitalizing his image, and perhaps, winning over the American people.<c><n><b><i>Democrates hailed by Republicans?

{"title": "F. Skiddy von Stade | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>Y</b>OU might see him walking through the Yard in a gray three-piece suit his back stiffly erect from a polo injury three years ago.  His name is Francis Skiddy von Stade Jr., and for most of the Class of '76, he is the most direct link with the overlapping jurisdictions and tangled paths of command that make up the Harvard Administration.</span></p> <p><span>As dean of Freshmen, he will serve <i>in loco parentis</i> for the 1000 first-year men and 200 first year women residing in the dormitories in and around the Yard.  He is the Harvard administrator <i>extraordinaire,</i> having sat in a University office since 1940, when he was chosen as an assistant dean.  \"With the exception of three and a half years during the War.  I've been in University Hall ever since,\" von Stade noted last week, looking out an ivied window of Harvard's main administration building.</span></p> <p><span>Although Skiddy, as his friends call him, is Harvard's senior administrator, he is not nearly at the top of the University's ladder of power.  He is a third echelon administrator, a step below men like Charles P. Whitlock, the dean of the College, who is in turn a step below the upper echelon of men like John T. Dunlop, dean of the Faculty, and, of course, President Derek C. Bok.</span></p> <p><span>Von Stade's influence over incoming freshmen is likely to be small, and even then in most cases only indirect.  The only times most freshmen see his office is in the beginning of the year when they submit their study cards showing what courses they have enrolled in, and at the end of each semester, when grades are issued.</span></p> <p><span><b>D</b>ESPITE the limited scope of von Stade's power, a small storm erupted last year when students learned that the freshmen women brought into the newly coeducationalized Yard would fall under his jurisdiction.  The objections stemmed from a private letter which von Stade had written to the director of Admissions at Radcliffe.  In the letter, which <i>The Crimson</i> obtained and published, von Stade said that he opposed any change from the former 4-to-1 ratio of men to women undergraduates at Harvard.  \"I said I thought that the world in the foreseeable future was going to be primarily run by men,\" he said.  \"And I still think so, quite honestly.\"  From this contention, von Stade draws the conclusion that the University should place a greater emphasis on the education of men than on that of women.</span></p> <p><span>Although he concedes his feelings on the question are \"perhaps more emotional than rational,\" von Stade believes there is a certain biological inevitability behind men having a role of greater leadership in our society.  \"My argument is speculative,\" he contends.  \"But it's also based on a certain amount of experience.  I know a number of very able women who've gone to college and graduated very high, and gone on to professional school, but an awful lot of them take themselves out of circulation from between ten and twenty years--through motherhood and family and this kind of thing.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Now, women are a hell of a lot more liberated than they ever were,\" he continued.  \"And I think they ought to be liberated more, at least in terms of their intellectual pursuits, but I don't think that most of them want a childless marriage.\"</span></p> <p><span>Von Stade sees daycare as an unfeasible alternative.  \"Everything I hear about daycare is that a child needs a parent during those years in which daycare would be needed,\" he said.  \"And I always read 'parent' to mean 'mother.'\"</span></p> <p><span><b>V</b>ON STADE likewise stands opposed to the most emphatic demand of women students:  equal admissions to Harvard and Radcliffe.  \"If we go one-to-one, you've got to think what's going to happen to the women's colleges,\" von Stade argues.  \"There aren't enough women to go around that have the academic measurements that we and the Seven Sisters use.\"</span></p> <p><span>Von Stade appears to have little fondness for student activism in general.  He termed the period of the student strikes in 1969 and 1970 \"hyperemotional.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I didn't particularly like those years,\" he recalts.  \"All the yelling and everything made things very uncomfortable.\"</span></p> <p><span>He says he thinks the students picked the University as a target for many antiwar protests simply because it was convenient.  \"The University was tangible.  The problems were intangible,\" he explains.  \"What the hell we had to do with the policy in Vietnam is still very difficult to understand.\"</span></p> <p><span>On the war itself von Stade comes out sounding closer to President Nixon than to Democratic nominee George McGovern.  \"My own feelings, at least now, are that it is a disaster that we ever got into the war,\" he says.  \"But my feelings even today are how do you get out.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't think you could just send a bunch of ships over there and all of a sudden decamp.  I don't think that many of us are qualified to say anything more than Let's get out as last as we can.  And fast is not as speedy as I lot of people would like.\"</span></p> <p><span>But von Stade is not like a lot of people.  Born of an old German Irish New York clan (the Skiddy is Irish, the von Stade German), he was brought up on Long Island, \"the world immediately following the world of the Great Gatsby,\" as he describes it.  His home town was Old Westbury, a New York suburb that he says \"used to cut a lot of mustard in certain novels.\"</span></p> <p><span>He prepped at aristocratic St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H., and went on to Harvard where he graduated in 1938.  \"I was going through college because that was the thing to do,\" he recalls.  \"But I enjoyed myself immensely.\"  One of his greatest joys was polo, which, he says, \"even then was regarded as esoteric.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE von Stade family are renowned horsemen.  Skiddy's father, who was also named Skiddy--\"He was what you called in those days a gentleman jockey,\" Skiddy Jr. says--founded the Museum of Racing in Saratoga, N.Y., along with Averill Harriman.</span></p> <p><span>When the young von Stade arrived at Harvard, he brought two polo ponies with him.  Needing more horses for a match, von Stade joined the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) and trained some of the field artillery horses for polo.  \"That was my drill,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Von Stade was thrown out of ROTC when he took the first term of his senior year off to tour South America with an international polo team, which, he recalls, \"turned out to be pretty much of a flop.\"  Returning to Harvard to graduate, he was offered a job as a master at St. Paul's.  He accepted the job, and then two years later, took another offer to come to Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>And judging from both the amount of time he has spent here and his pronouncements, von Stade likes Harvard the way it is.  \"I wouldn't like to see the University reorient itself in any significant way,\" he says.  \"I wouldn't like to see it turn out a lot of Democrats or a lot of Republicans--certainly not a lot of SDS.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm all for evolution rather than revolution,\" he commented.  \"That's partly to do with my age, and partly to do with my make up.\"</span></p> <p><span>The process of evolution he believes in is not a rapid one.  \"Take a step and see how it works out,\" he says.  \"But I don't mean take a step this year and take another step next year.  You've got to think in generational terms, which is only four years here.  You've got to go slow.\"</span></p> <p><span>Asked why he thought students wanted the process of change to go faster, von Stade said that he himself was equally impatient in his youth.  \"Students are taught to have ideas,\" he said.  \"But they have to learn how to feel about them.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Stifling the News | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE SUPREME COURTS refusal this summer to exempt newsmen from divulging their sources before Federal grand juries strikes directly at the right of the American people to be informed by an unfettered press.  In a decision based on the premise that a newsman, like any other citizen, must cooperate with a grand jury even though the jury may ask him to violate the confidence of persons who supply him information, the Court ignores the imperatives of investigative reporting.  And it is largely through investigative reporting that the press serves the cause of justice and fulfills its role as the conscience of government.</span></p> <p><span>By declining to expand First Amendment rights to safeguard a reporter's confidentiality, the Court has endangered the ability of newsmen to gather information about illicit activities.  The Court's majority opinion holds that newsmen enjoy no special privilege before a grand jury; it maintains that newsmen have recourse through the courts to challenge a jury's interrogation if they feel it is peripheral to the case under investigation.  Further, the Court says that by requiring newsmen to divulge sources, given this legal recourse, it is imposing no prior restraint not any other shackle forbidden by the Constitution.  Yet the practical effect of the Court's decision is that no mobster, no political dissident, no corrupt Congressman, nor any other person involved in illegal activities will (provided he has any sense) discuss those activities with the press.  The knowledge that anything said to a reporter is subject to grand jury scrutiny effectively restricts the ability of the press to expose, investigate and analyze.  Indeed, the Supreme Court's decision must come as welcome relief to shysters who know the chances are 50-50 they can buy off the police, but who become queasy under the curious eye of a self-righteous, snooping reporter.</span></p> <p><span>Think only of the last year.  Neil Sheehan of The New York Times would be required to say who passed him the Pentagon Papers.  The same for columnist Jack Anderson and his ITT scoop.  Or more recently, The Times would be compelled to name before a grand jury every source--many of whom would be incriminated--for its series detailing graft in the New York City construction business totalling over $25 million annually.  The City of New York either could not, or did not bother to, uncover the scandal.  The Times did.  But had those men who supplied The Times its information known they would have no protection before a grand jury should The Times's reporter be called to testify, they never would have spoken up.  The story never would have been written.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>ERTAINLY members of the press do not constitute any elite class which should be granted special privileges before the Constitution.  But the function of a free press, as outlined in the Constitution, demands that the privilege of confidentiality be bestowed upon the press and its functionaries, reporters.  It is a right of profession:  just as, <i>in most states,</i> a priest does not have to breach the contract of confession and a lawyer is protected in discussions with a client accused of a felony, so should a reporter be able to use the guarantee of confidentiality to flush out information which hastens the pursuit of justice.</span></p> <p><span>It is ironic that the Court's decision also precludes the possibility of investigative reporting which names names and pinpoints crimes.  Such reports have often led to prosecution.  The notion expressed by Mr. Justice Stewart in a dissenting opinion that the Court's decision \"invites state and Federal authorities to undermine the historic independence of the press by attempting to annex the journalistic profession as an investigative arm of government\" is well taken.  Unfortunately, the Court's decision creates an atmosphere in which the likelihood of a reporter being able to obtain information which could weigh on an investigation is slim indeed.</span></p> <p><span>In another dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice Douglas said:</span></p> <p><span>\"The inclusion of government into this domain is symptomatic of the disease of this society.  As the years pass the power of government becomes more and more pervasive.  It is a power to suffocate both people and causes.</span></p> <p><span>\"Those in power, whatever their politics, want only to perpetuate it.  Now that the fences of the law and the tradition that has protected the press are broken down, the people are the victims.  The First Amendment, as I read it, was designed to prevent that tragedy.\"</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, the decision speaks for itself:  it and another limiting Congressional immunity in the case of Seq. Mike Gravel (D-Als.) and his release of the Pentagon Papers, intone a tragic shift of the Supreme Court to a Mizonesque majority.  The days of the Warren Court, of sweeping judicial reform, of the highest regard for civil liberty and human dignity, are passing us by as President Nixon assures a conservative majority.  Even the Court's decision outlawing the death penalty--based largely on its inconsistent application--fuels a longing for an Abe Fortas or a Homer Thornberry.  As time goes on, reflection on the former's abdication from the Court and the latter's forgotten nomination will become all the more painful.  For now, one can only hope that a turnover in November will bring new perspective to Court nominations, should a vacancy occur.  And further that those reporters who now face the choice of imprisonment or incrimination of their sources will, in the true spirit of the Constitution choose the former.</span></p>"}
{"title": "A Spring of Rekindled Activism | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>HEN student activism lulled following the chaos of the student strikes of 1969 and 1970, many observers were quick to hail the demise of campus politics and the growth of alcohol, drugs and apathy.  Last Spring the political somnolence of Harvard students was shaken, if not to full wakefulness, at least to a semi-conscious state.</span></p> <p><span>Three events were mainly responsible for this shaking one of them the war was well trod territory, while the others--an imbroglio over investment in Portuguese Africa and a controversy over a cut in pay to teaching fellows--were fresh ground.  On top of these, a host of other issues embroiled those on the campus who were specifically concerned with them and sometimes those who couldn't really care less but had nothing better to do with their time.</span></p> <p><span>The familiar heat of antiwar fever surged sharply but briefly, after President Nixon's decision to escalate the bombing of North Vietnam and mine the country's harbors.  Yet peace activity was both slower and less forceful at Harvard than at many other colleges throughout the nation.  While many schools were whipped into nearly instantaneous rage following Nixon's March 30 speech, students here failed to mount any serious antiwar actions until a week later when a loose coalition of antiwar groups called a mass campus meeting to plan protests.</span></p> <p><span>The first of these mass meetings--which were held in Sanders Theatre with overflow audience accommodated in Lowell Lecture Hall--drew about 2200 people.  But this group quickly dwindled as the resolutions put to vote appeared increasingly contradictory and the debate meaningless.  The most notable result of the first meeting was the declaration of a five-day University-wide strike with a stipulation that a second mass meeting be held at the end of that time to consider further action.</span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>ANY who attended the meeting and who listened to it broadcast over Harvard radio station WHRB were unclear about what constituted a strike.  One faction said it meant a boycott of all classes; another group said it meant a general orientation toward antiwar activity--classes would not necessarily be skipped unless there was a conflicting peace protest planned.  In any case, by the end of the five-day strike period only about 10 per cent of the student body were cutting classes--just about the normal percentage during the academic year.</span></p> <p><span>Attendance at the second mass meeting was sharply reduced:  only about 700 people showed up and most of them didn't stay for long.  The debate bogged down over the very question of whether a continuation of an announced boycott of classes was a proper course for the protest to take.  The meeting initially passed a resolution terminating the strike, but later, as the attendance dropped, it reversed itself and passed a resolution continuing the strike indefinitely.</span></p> <p><span>The weary protesters adjourned the meeting before any vote could be taken on resolutions calling for substantive antiwar actions.  And the next morning, class attendance showed that the call for a strike had gone almost entirely unheeded.  Antiwar protests continued among smaller, specialized groups, but the attempt to give the movement a mass.  University-wide base had failed.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>MUCH MORE DRAMATIC conflict--and one which ran concurrent to and may have sapped some of the strength of the antiwar movement--was the controversy surrounding Harvard's ownership of 683,000 shares of Gulf Oil Corporation stock.  A group of black students, calling themselves the Pan-African Liberation Committee (PALC), called upon the University to sell its shares in Gulf--valued at about $18.5 million--and thus sever its connection with the company the group said was causing the greatest harm to the people of southern Africa.</span></p> <p><span>PALC accused Gulf, which maintains oil drilling facilities in the Portuguese colony of Angola, of providing crucial revenues and support for the Portuguese government in their suppression of independence movements in their African colonies.  After seven months of delays by the Administration while they weighed alternative approaches to the situation, PALC staged a two-hour mill-in at University Hall, the campus's main administrative building.</span></p> <p><span>Shortly afterward, President Bok's assistant on investment policy, Stephen B. Farber '63, issued a report presenting the arguments given by each side in the dispute.  The report was given to the Harvard Corporation, the University's highest governing body which holds responsibility for all investment decisions.  After considering Farber's arguments, as well as meeting with the black student leaders, the Corporation decided not to sell the stock.  Instead, it said it would await further factual information, which Gulf promised to release, and a trip by Farber to Angola, which it said would provide first-hand information on the situation in Africa.</span></p> <p><span>The blacks, infuriated by the Administration's response, decided to occupy Massachusetts Hall, the building which houses the offices of the President and his staff.  At about 5:30 a.m. the day after the Corporation's decision was announced, 35 students entered Mass Hall through a first-floor window and said they would not leave until Harvard sold its stock.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE OCCUPATION quickly gathered support among the University community, with faculty as well as students--sometimes numbering as many as 1000--marching around the building in support of the occupiers.  While the blacks inside the building read announcements and played soul music over a make-shift public address system set up in a second-floor window, supporters maintained a picket line around the building 24 hours a day during the occupation as a safeguard against a police bust.  The commotion was so great that some freshmen in Yard dorms adjacent to Mass Hall temporarily moved to local hotels--at University expense.</span></p> <p><span>From the start of the occupation, the Administration followed a sit-tight policy, preferring to pursue increasingly severe legal sanctions against the demonstrators rather than use police power to evict them.  And despite the worries of some frantic letter-writing alumni who scorned the trespass on sacred University property (Mass Hall is Harvard's oldest brick structure, built in 1720), the strategy paid off.  Only a week after the occupation began, the blacks decided to vacate the building rather than face heavy fines and jail sentences.</span></p> <p><span>\"These sentences would remove us from the struggle,\" the last voice to come over the loud speaker explained.  \"The issue is Harvard out of Gulf and not Mass Hall.\"</span></p> <p><span>The wheels of University discipline then began to turn, but they yielded one of the most tame and puzzling verdicts ever delivered.  The Committee one Rights and Responsibilities, itself a frequent target of radical attacks, decided against any punishment for any of the occupiers.  Instead it handed down what it called a suspended requirement to withdraw.  This meant that all the students were told their offense merited a suspension from the University for a year, but that because of their strongly held convictions and the non-violent nature of their protest, the faculty suspended the punishment.</span></p> <p><span>That same week, the academic year ended and the issue was successfully defused, at least until school reopens this month.  A controversy is likely to arise when Presidential assistant Farber issues his report on his trip to Angola this summer.  The report, which will be given to the Corporation in time for their September 11 meeting and released to the public a few weeks later, is expected to take no stand on what the University should do with the Gulf shares.  Instead, Farber said last month that he plans to present the arguments of both sides as he has discovered them to be, and any first-hand information he has found which supports either side.  The blacks are not likely to be pleased with anything short of a strong denunciation of Gulf, and a subsequent Corporation decision to sell the stock.  The probability of this seems small, and the issue remains one to watch in the coming months.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>NOTHER CONTROVERSY which arose last Spring and which may explode again this year, began when the Faculty of Arts and Sciences announced the elimination of a special tuition assistance scholarship for teaching fellows.  The elimination of the scholarship amounted to a cut in pay for many of the University's 1000 teaching fellows, the graduate students who assist professors in teaching most undergraduate courses.</span></p> <p><span>The University excused the measure as part of an overall move toward increased financial stringency, but many graduate students felt the University was tightening its belt around their nocks.</span></p> <p><span>The scholarship's elimination succeeded in consolidating the normally fragmented graduate student populace.  Five days after the announcement of the cutback, a group of about 200 grad students launched the Graduate Student and Teaching Fellow Union, which was to grow in membership to nearly 1200 within a month.</span></p> <p><span>The Union voted to make four demands:  reinstatement of the Staff Tuition Scholarship program, recognition of the Union as the role bargaining agent for graduate students and teaching fellows, cancellation of a planned tuition increase for third-year students, and a full disclosure of the University's operating budget.</span></p> <p><span>To put force behind their demands, the grad students declared two \"work stoppages,\" one lasting one day, the other two.  The work stoppages included picketing of University classroom buildings, and many undergraduates skipped classes in support of the Union.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, the leadership of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, headed by Dean John T. Dunlop, defended the University's position, but agreed to informal talks with representatives of the Union.  The Administration wanted the talks to proceed on the level of scholarly debate:  the Union wanted nothing short of collective bargaining.  After four informal sessions, the grad students walked out.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE UNION leadership then called for a vote for an official strike.  A majority of the Union's membership voted in favor of striking but the figure was short of the 60 per cent mandate required by the Union's constitution for passage.</span></p> <p><span>Looking back on the year, Barbara C. Herman, a teaching fellow in Social Studies and a member of the Union's steering committee, said that the only way the Union could win its demands was through continued collective action during the upcoming academic year.</span></p> <p><span>Dean Dunlop has written to the steering committee that he wants to \"establish procedures by which further discussions can be fruitfully carried forward.\"  But the Union has so far rejected his overtures, saying:  \"The only type of meeting which we would consider is one in which we meet as a recognized union for purposes of collective bargaining.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dunlop, an expert in labor relations and a seasoned labor negotiator, has repeatedly stated that he believes collective bargaining has no place in an academic community.</span></p> <p><span>To the Union, however, the need of graduate students to be representated by a recognized union is a central assumption, not an issue peripheral to their other demands.</span></p> <p><span>Neither side is likely to give in without a flight, and if the Union is able to pull itself together in the new school year, the Harvard campus is likely to be rocked by the graduate students' issue once more.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>NE OF THE NOISIEST protests--and by far the most prolonged--was a year-long attack by Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) on Psychology Professor Richard J. Herrnstein.  Herrnstein--previously a virtual unknown on the campus outside of his specialty--was catapulted to public attention in September, 1971, when SDS made him the target of their campaign against racism after he published an article on intelligence in The Atlantic Monthly.</span></p> <p><span>The article, entitled Simply \"I.Q.\" said that a virtually hereditary meritocracy based on intellectual abilities will arise as contemporary political and social goals are realized.  Herrnstein believes that our society is evolving distinct classes based on intelligence, and that the I.Q. gap between the upper and the lower classes is increasing.  This belief in based on his conviction that intelligence is 80 per cent inheritable.</span></p> <p><span>In his own words, his theory \"points to a future in which--social classes not only continue but become ever more solidly built on inborn differences.\"  He says that as the social barriers of the past, such as race, religion, nationality, title and inherited wealth, are knocked down by liberal reforms, actual social mobility will be blocked by \"innate human differences.\"</span></p> <p><span>What angered SDS so much about the article was not what it said, but the implications they saw in it concerning difference in intelligence between blacks and whites.  In his article, Herrnstein cautiously evaded answering the question of what causes the commonly observed statistical difference in I.Q. scores between blacks and whites.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>NVERTING Herrnstein's logic, SDS concluded that he was saying that current poorer classes are intellectually deficient, and thus the group equated Herrnstein with Berkeley geneticist Arthur Jensen and Stanford engineer William Shockley who say outright that blacks are the intellectual inferiors of whites.  The clear implication in Herrnstein's article, SDS said, is that blacks must remain poor because they are genetically inferior.</span></p> <p><span>Herrnstein's actual thoughts on racial differences in intelligence only came later, when he told <i>The Crimson:</i></span></p> <p><span>\"What I think on the question of racial differences is this.  First of all, there is a demonstrated difference in the scores of blacks and whites on intelligence tests.  This has been shown by study after study.  Second, there are also some scraps of evidence that this difference may be genetic.  But finally, there is overwhelming evidence that blacks have been discriminated against.  And it is altogether possible that this discrimination has affected intelligence test results.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"What the question boils down to is how much of the difference is genetic,\" he continued.  \"At this point we just can't tell.  The difference in test scores could conceivably be entirely due to environmental factors.  The genetic factor could be zero.\"</span></p> <p><span>SDS pursued the issue nonetheless.  Throughout the Fall semester, the group picketed and leafletted.  In Herrnstein's main class, Social Sciences 15, \"Introduction to Psychology.\"  Many faculty members were incensed at the protests, which they considered to constitute personal harrassment.</span></p> <p><span>In November, more than 100 faculty members--including some of Harvard's most prestigious luminaries--signed a statement which appeared as an advertisement in <i>The Crimson</i> supporting Herrnstein's right to teach his theories and denouncing the SDS protests.  The statement termed the protests \"brutish,\" and accused SDS of attacking Herrnstein personally through \"false and offensive placards, leaflets, picketing and threats to disrupt his classes.\"</span></p> <p><span>SDS's strongest protest against Herrnstein occurred in March, when 25 members of SDS noisily pursued Herrnstein for 20 minutes after he left his lecture in Soc Sci 15.  As a result of the protest, Herrnstein and Dean of the College Charles P. Whitlock pressed charges against the demonstrators, alleging \"intense personal harassment.\"  The case--which was heard before the Committee on Rights and Responsibilities (CRR)--ended in a deadlock but his publishers were handed out.</span></p> <p><span>Since the CRR hearing, the protests have quieted down, largely because SDS began to realize their Herrnstein campaign had almost no support among the student body.  SDS itself has degenerated since its heyday in the late sixties into little more than a noisy splinter group, enjoying little if any student support.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>NOTHER FACULTY MEMBER was the subject of an attack, but in this case the source was not radical students:  it was the U.S. Government.</span></p> <p><span>Samuel L. Popkin, assistant professor of Government and an expert in Vietnamese affairs, was called before a Boston grand jury empanelled to investigate crime surrounding the Pentagon Papers case.  Prier to coming to Harvard, Popkin had worked with Daniel Ellsberg '52, the self-acknowledged distributor of the Papers.</span></p> <p><span>When called upon by the jury to testify on his knowledge of the leak of the Papers, Popkin refused, saying the information was gathered \"in his capacity as a scholar, author and teacher,\" and that disclosure would violate the confidentiality of his sources in-his-research.</span></p> <p><span>The case seesawed back and forth in the courts all last year, and seemed far from a conclusion in August.  At times it looked as though Popkin would face immanent imprisonment:  at others, the government appeared to be retreating at full speed.  The case is likely to drag on well into the coming year.<c><n><b>SAMUEL L. POPKIN</b></n></c></span></p>"}
{"title": "Support the NLF | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>F</b>OUR YEARS have gone by, and the war has changed.  Richard Nixon became President of the United States with the promise that he would end the war in Vietnam.  Although he has not ended the war he has ended the antiwar movement.  From all we can tell, he considers his policy a great success.</span></p> <p><span>So, apparently do the American people We are left with the spectacle of the world's most powerful nation democratically deciding to grind a much smaller country into the dust While American men were dying the people of the United States wrestled with the life and death question.  Should we be there?  It was a concrete and immediate question.  Now only Vietnamese people are dying.  The question has become an abstraction.</span></p> <p><span>Relieved and grateful that they are no longer paying the price in blood.  Americans have permitted the war to become just another issue.  For the Vietnamese the war can never become another issue.  Every day American planes bomb their country, devastating their land and their lives to an extent that we cannot comprehend.  Under President Nixon, the war has escalated to a new level of terror.  The mining of the harbors, the step-up in the bombing, and the introduction of fragmentation bombs are the cynical acts of a man who lives in a world of political rhetoric where a life is simply a bargaining chip.  Polls say that the American people do not want to bargain they believe the U.S. should never have become involved and now they want only to get out \"with honor.\"  Who will tell them the truth, that there is no honor left in this miserable neo-colonialist adventure?  Not President Nixon.</span></p> <p><span>President Nixon will not tell them that their country is destroying Vietnam to protect a corrupt and despicable tyrant who fought with the French army against his own people in 1954.  He will not tell them that President Thieu and his string of predecessors have failed to win the support of the people of South Vietnam because they realize that they need only the support of the United States to remain in power.  He will not tell them that Viet Minh (the direct ancestor of the National Liberation Front) was the only group to mount an effective resistance against the Japanese invader in World War II and against the French colonialists who attempted to regain their imperialist booty after the war.  He will not tell them that North Vietnam sent troops into the South only after the United States willfully sabotaged the Geneva Agreements which would have created a stable and peaceful Vietnam.  He will not tell them that the United States is losing the war, and that unless the barbarity continues indefinitely and America is able to destroy the entire fabric of Vietnamese society, the liberation forces will be successful.  He says only that they are Communists, and that the United States will not \"sell out\" its despot or \"abandon\" its prisoners.  He says only that the United States must emerge with honor.  He has said it so often that the words are beginning to take on a life of their own.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>E MUST NOT forget that the words are all lies.  The POW issue is a fraud.  No country at war will release its prisoners until the war is over.  Once the Indochina war ends satisfactorily, the North Vietnamese would be inconceivably stupid to retain American prisoners and needlessly inflame American public opinion.  The American government, which is engaging in mass terror on an unprecedented scale, likes to point to NLF terror.  It is true that the NLF has assassinated carefully selected Saigon officials.  It is also true that while the American and Saigon terror have lost support for the perpetrators, the NLF terror has built support by eliminating hated outsiders, who usually were foisted on a village by the central Saigon government.  Lacking the unlimited support of a wealthy superpower, the NLF was forced to rely on the support of the villagers.  The 1968 Hue massacre which has reached legendary status in American propaganda, was indiscriminate, but as Frances Fitzgerald notes in her acclaimed book, <i>Fire in the Lake,</i> the Hue massacre seems to have been the work of troops gone beserk.  Unlike the indiscriminate terror of the United States and Saigon governments, the killing at Hue was not ordered by responsible officials.  Can we say the same for the continuing massacre committed by American planes?</span></p> <p><span>America is only the last and most powerful of the enemies that have opposed Vietnamese in dependence for the last hundred years Three years ago <i>The Crimson</i> announced its support for the NLF.  Since that time, the removal of American draftees from combat and the repeated, reasonable offers of the Provisional Revolutionary Government and the NLF for a coalition government can only reinforce our conviction.  The cruel trick of Vietnamization has proven that calling for the end of the war is not enough.  Most Americans think the war is ending, although in fact it is escalating.</span></p> <p><span>Once again we say that the Vietnamese liberation forces will eventually win.  They deserve to win We support them.</span></p>"}

Martin A Linsky (R-Brookline) and Rep. Robert Driman (D-Newton)--meet at the polls in November.</span></p> <p><span>Linsky won last Tuesday's four way primary in a tight race with conservative new comer Avi Nelson who ran on a platform supporting President Nixon.  His campaign slogan was \"I'm not afraid to be right.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although Drinan was unopposed in the primary, he had workers at every poll on Tuesday and held a mass rally on primary night in an obvious effort to gear up his campaign for the tough November night.  Drinan managed to keep himself in the public spotlight all summer as he served as the vocal leader of the Massachusetts delegation to the Democratic National Convention.</span></p> <p><span>The new Fourth Congressional District, stretching from Brookline to Gardner, has 42,000 Republicans, 76,000 Democrats and a large swing vote of 82,000 independents.  Twenty-three percent of the district is Jewish, with the heaviest concentrations in Brookline and Newton, a Drinan stronghold in the last Congressional race.</span></p> <p><span>Linsky, who is Jewish, could sway many of the Drinan supporters in these two towns where he did very well in Tuesday's primary.  In a poll taken by the Linsky staff last April.  Drinan only held a ten point lead.  In Brookline and Newton, the polls showed that both candidates had a third of the vote with the remainder undecided.</span></p> <p><span>The Linsky forces plan to make a major effort to contact all the voters in the district before the November election.  \"We are relying on field organization in the campaign.  The major crux of our effort will be a detailed blitz and canvass which we will aim at everyone, Democrats, Republicans, and independents,\" Steve Crosby, the campaign manager for Linsky, said Friday.</span></p> <p><span>Originally Linsky tried to play down his party affiliation by taking a strong anti-war stance.  But the primary showed a strong conservative vote in the district, and Linsky may now drift toward the right.  With Drinan so closely tied in to the McGovern campaign, a strong Nixon showing in November could bring victory to Linsky.</span></p> <p><span><b>Fifth Congressional District</b></span></p> <p><span>In one of the most expensive primaries ever, John Kerry, a former spokesman for the Vietnam Veterans Against the War won the Democratic nomination in the Fifth Congressional district.  Ten Democrats, four Republicans and one independent spent more than half a million dollars before Tuesday's primary.  Kerry topped all contenders, spending a limit over $1,35,000.</span></p> <p><span>The 28-year old Yale graduate will face Republican Paul Cronin of Andover in the November election.  Cronin is a former aide to Congressman F. Bradford Morse and has great strength in the Andover area where he was elected its youngest selectman.</span></p> <p><span>The race should be close.  Although the Democrats enjoy a 56,000 advantage in registration over the Republicans, the independent vote--which totals 77,000--could be decisive if there is a strong Nixon surge in November.</span></p> <p><span>Nancy Barton, Kerry's campaign treasurer, said Saturday the emphasis in the upcoming campaign will be different from that in the primary.  \"Last time the purpose of the campaign was to identify our supporters and get them to the polls; in November, most voters will go anyway and we have to influence the way they vote.  Also the thrust of our campaign will depend on whether Cronin runs as a liberal and on how much money he gets from the Nixon administration which I'm sure doesn't want to see Kerry elected.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kerry's chances for victory were threatened on election eve when his brother and a campaign aide were arrested in an incident reminiscent of the Watergate affair.  The police charged the two with tampering with the phones in the cellar of a building which housed Kerry's campaign headquarters as well as that of one of his opponents.  Kerry later told reporters that they had entered the cellar to protect his own phone lines which he claimed had been threatened earlier in the evening by an anonymous caller.</span></p> <p><span>Although the incident received much press coverage the voting did not seem to be affected by it.  It is possible though that the incident may become a factor in the November election.</span></p> <p><span>It didn't have much impact.  People were just very confused since it came so close to the election.  The hearing on the case will be in October a very bad time,\" Barton said.</span></p> <p><span><b>Ninth Congressional District</b></span></p> <p><span>Although losing her home precinct, Rep. Louise Day Hicks (D-Boston) has obviously not lost her appeal as she won a smashing victory over five opponents in the Ninth Congressional District's Democratic primary last Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span>In November she will face Republican candidate Howard Miller and Boston City Councilman John J. Moakley, who bypassed the Democratic primary to run as an independent in the general election.  Because the new district--which extends from Dover St. in Roxbury to Dover, an upper middle class suburb--is heavily Democratic.  Miller should not be much of a threat.  Moakley, who won last year's City Council race with 94,000 votes, is expected to be a dangerous challenger.</span></p> <p><span>In the 1970 primary Hicks defeated Moakley by 5000 votes although Moakley claims he would have won if David Nelson, a black candidate, had not divided the anti-Hicks vote.</span></p> <p><span>This year, Hicks won the primary by a three to two margin over second place finisher Senator Robert Cawley (D-W. Roxbury) who masterminded the redistricting in the State House.  Although Cawley drew the Congressional district boundaries to include most of his present district, he could only manage 26 per cent of the vote to Hicks's 39 per cent.  The third place finisher.  James W. Hennigan, the Boston School Committee chairman, did poorly, getting 21 per cent of the vote.</span></p> <p><span>Although predicting Hicks would win, political analysts were surprised by her overwhelming victory, since her two strongholds.  Dorchester and South Boston, were cut out of the district in the reapportionment.</span></p> <p><span>Two black candidates fared poorly in the race.  Newton resident Hubert H. Jones, the most liberal of the candidates, placed fourth with 8068 votes, largely outdistancing Melvin Miller, publisher of the Bay State Banner, who received 1592 votes.</span></p> <p><span><b>Second Middlesex District-Senate</b></span></p> <p><span>The old politics continued to prevail in the Second Middlesex District, as State Senator Francis X. McCann (D-Cambridge) swept to victory against four opponents in Tuesday's Democratic primary.</span></p> <p><span>The district, which includes Harvard Square and much of Cambridge, also takes in Belmont.  Waltham and parts of Allston and Brighton.  McCann's main opponent Cambridge School Committeeman David Wylie, ran 2237 votes behind the incumbent, in unofficial returns.  Two years earlier Wylie lost to McCann by 1800 votes.  McCann seems certain of re-election as he faces only token Republican opposition in November.</span></p> <p><span>John Hogan '73, mounted an aggressive campaign, yet failed to produce a sizable vote anywhere except in his home area Allston-Brighton.  Hogan carried Ward 22 in that area by about 1000 votes over McCann and Wylie, but trailed far behind in the other parts of the district.  In Cambridge, Hogan only got 553 votes to 5221 for McCann and 3701 for Wylie.</span></p> <p><span>As it has in the past, McCann's base of support in North Cambridge turned out for him.  In the 11th Ward, for example, McCann got 1536 votes to only 313 for Wylie.  Hogan, who has many relatives who grew up in North Cambridge, only could manage 128 votes in the 11th Ward.</span></p> <p><span>From the way his concession speech sounded Tuesday night, it doesn't seem likely that Wylie will ever choose to do battle with McCann again.  Wylie will have to face Hogan's brother today at 9:30 a.m. in Brighton District Court.  A hearing will be held at that time on Joseph Hogan's complaint that Wylie assaulted him two Saturday's ago while he was campaigning at a Brighton Shopping center.</span></p> <p><span><b>First Middlesex District-Representative</b></span></p> <p><span>City Councillor and former Mayor Alfred Vellucci, running on a pledge to end Harvard's tax-exempt status in Cambridge, fell short last Tuesday in his bid for a seat in the State Legislature.</span></p> <p><span>Incumbent State Representatives Michael J. Lombardi and John J. Toomey were re-elected in the First Middlesex District's Democratic primary, despite the challenge from Vellucci and two liberal candidates.  Michael J. Amato and Doreen Blanc.  The two winners will face only token opposition in November.</span></p> <p><span>Lombardi led the balloting, taking 2585 votes.  Toomey ran 220 votes behind Lombardi, with Vellucci just missing the second spot by 274 votes.</span></p> <p><span>Vellucci was beaten in his own backyard, Ward 2, by both Lombardi and Toomey, offsetting the Councillor's solid showing in Ward 1. Lombardi swept Ward 1 with 1448 votes, followed by Vellucci with 1109 and Toomey with 878.</span></p> <p><span>Toomey retained his seat by piling up a 505-vote margin over Vellucci in Wards 2, 3, and 4.</span></p> <p><span>Some observers had believed that Lombardi would be hurt by a gambling conviction last December, but instead the four-term representative topped the ticket.

{"title": "The New Populism? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N THE MASSACHUSETTS and Wisconsin primaries earlier this year Senator McGovern took a stance which some political analysts have described as the new populism.  McGovern advocated breaking up big corporations, closing tax loopholes, and cutting the taxes of middle-income people.  These stands and his forthright position on Vietnam led him to victory.</span></p> <p><span>The major problem facing the new populists is the same as that of their predecessors 80 years ago; race hatred.  Populism in the early 1890's was free of rectal overtones, but by 1897 much of its platform was based on provincialism, nativism and racism.</span></p> <p><span>The major spokesman for populism today, in addition to Senator McGovern, are Jeff Greenfield and Jack Newfield.  They have produced a statement--<i>A Populist Manifesto</i>--which outlines most of the positions McGovern articulated early in his campaign.  The book includes a set of policy prescriptions, but it fails to deal with the two key issues directly related to race-welfare and busing.  McGovern has suffered from a similar inability to develop solid positions on these issues.</span></p> <p><span>Welfare should be viewed as a racial issue because people commonly believe that most welfare clients are black freeloaders.  It is not uncommon while campaigning in white working-class neighborhoods to hear people complaining about how hard they work to eke out an existence and about how people on welfare (blacks) get to live in hotels.</span></p> <p><span>As has been well documented by now, Senator McGovern's campaign took a nosedive after his tax reform-welfare proposal--which involved giving every Americans $1000--came under attack during the California primary campaign.  McGovern's early 20-point lead in the polls slipped to an eventual five point margin of victory.  The South Dakota Senator has revised his plan since then, but the substance of his revisions remains unclear to large segments of the American people.</span></p> <p><span>In their book.  Newfield and Greenfield totally dodge the welfare question.  Greenfield explained in an interview last week that he felt McGovern should have come out against any form of guaranteed annual income.  \"He should have told the American people that the Moynihan Family Assistance Plan will put more people on the welfare rolls than have ever been on them at any time in history.  McGovern should say that he will work to give every able-bodied American a job.\"</span></p> <p><span>Yet other than opening up the craft and construction unions which employ only a small portion of the work force.  Greenfield could offer no specific plans for creating more jobs.  Greenfield must surely realize that over 80 per cent of the people on welfare are receiving Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) benefits and unable to work at regular jobs.  In 1970 the New York State legislature passed a measure requiring all able-bodied recipients to take public service jobs or risk losing their benefits.  About 1 per cent of the state's welfare clients were required to go to work.</span></p> <p><span>Greenfield and McGovern refuse to support a guaranteed annual income because they recognize that people will interpret the measure as an effort to give blacks a free ride.  The critical point which the populists have not made is that two-thirds of the welfare recipients in this country are white.  Because of legislation related to the War on Poverty discriminate against the white poor, whites have become hostile to most social legislation.  Welfare reform must be presented so that whites as well as blacks will feel that they are going to benefit from it.  Newfield and Greenfield have shown that legislation must be initiated along class lines, rather than racial ones, but unless populists confront the controversial issue directly, their movement will be weakened.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b> COALITION OF middle-class white ethnic groups and blacks based on their common interests is a key component of the new populism.  Newfield said last week that this coalition would initially be urban-based.  Unfortunately for Senator McGovern and other populists, it is in the cities that white ethnics are growing increasingly antagonistic toward blacks and Puerto Ricans.  We are now entering a period of racial strife as intense as any we have experienced since the end of World War I.</span></p> <p><span>In Chicago, one of the few successful white working-class insurgent efforts against the Daley machine has been led by a segregationist priest, Father Lawlor.  Newark, where a black mayor was elected in 1969, has seen almost no interaction between Italians and blacks.  New York's formerly liberal Jewish candidates are now emphasizing their opposition to housing projects and school busing.  And many people in the Irish and Italian sections of Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx, have left the Democratic Party to join the Conservative Party.</span></p> <p><span>Neither Newfield and Greenfield nor McGovern has been able to deal with the highly inflamatory issue of busing.  Newfield and Greenfield can avoid it in their book, but as a presidential candidate McGovern has been forced to speak on the subject, in spite of his reluctance to take a firm position.  The power of the issue was demonstrated in the Florida primary, where Governor Wallace won a smashing victory.  The anti-busing forces won another major victory in that primary when an anti-busing resolution got 75 per cent of the vote.</span></p> <p><span>McGovern's primary successes were in states where busing was not an over-riding issue.  His adherence to the approach Newfield and Greenfield outlined brought him stunning victories.  Canvassers for McGovern emphasized the inequities of the tax structure and the electorate responded enthusiastically to this appeal.</span></p> <p><span>Another nagging problem of the new populism is the source of the money for the social reform programs which Newfield, Greenfield, and McGovern have supported.  The cost of financing the Kennedy National Health Insurance bill would be staggering.  And if taxes are to be raised to pay for such a program, some of the increase will fall on the shoulders of the working class.</span></p> <p><span>In a review of <i>A Populist Manifesto</i> in New York Magazine, James Q. Wilson, chairman of the Government Department, wrote that \"In Forest Hills, New York and Pontiac, Michigan, whites do not think that the most important question of the decade is whether General Motors is one giant company or five nearly-giant companies or whether Carter Burden's money is confiscated by a 90 per cent estate tax.  They think that the most important issue is whether housing projects with poor black tenants will be built in their neighborhoods and whether white school children will be bused to distant black schools.\"  Clearly there is some truth in this statement.</span></p> <p><span>But as McGovern learned in some primary states, there are many people who are deeply concerned over the inequities in our economic system.  The job of the new populists is to show these members of the white working class that blacks must be their allies, rather than their enemies.  But to do this they must be explicit and by hedging on issues like busing and welfare, all they do is quash out any hopes for a new populism.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Standing on Nothing | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE 1972 POLITICAL atmosphere reeks with the Watergate scandal, \"cocktails and bologna sandwiches,\" ITT-Nixon fumblings, Eagleton disorders, subdued Agnewian imagery, campaign staff bickering, and an obsession with the impact of polls.  In 1970, George McGovern began his campaign stressing issues, especially Vietnam; while last July President Nixon called this the most \"issue-oriented\" campaign of the 20th century.  Yet clarity, precision, and in-depth discussion of issues has been notably absent from the campaign.</span></p> <p><span>McGovern has presented several policy statements.  The Wall Street tax reform message presented only a few specifics.  His decisive stance on Vietnam disguises the absence of a comprehensive view of world politics.  To pull out of Vietnam in 90 days may be specific, but Thailand's fate remains ambiguous.</span></p> <p><span>McGovern's attempts to present specific policy statements have been hampered by his tardiness.  Even before the 1960 campaign, John Kennedy's advisers had numerous polished and clear position papers ready to deliver and defend.  George McGovern has advisers (including several from Harvard), but his timing is poor.  Policies which should have been formulated months ago are being promised for the first week of November.</span></p> <p><span>Nixon literally prefers to avoid issues, or, for that matter, public speaking.  His \"surrogates\" are assuming the task of bringing him to the people.  But what does one hear from these men and women (females who are either family members or hold the crusading title, \"Consumer Affairs Adviser?\")  Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz accuses McGovern of lying about the U.S.-Soviet Grain Deal, and days later Spiro Agnew announces an FBI investigation on the same topic (centering around the original charges made by McGovern).  John Connally talks campaign money and Democrats-for-Nixon, but nothing else.  Housing and Urban Development Secretary George Romney travels to Pennsylvania and engages in political mud-slinging with Democratic Governor Milton Shapp.  Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird issues \"white-flag\" charges that explain nothing and allow him to evade intelligent discussion of rising defense costs.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>NE KNOWS THAT Nixon went to Moscow and Peking, instituted a wage and price control system, brought 506,000 Americans back from Vietnam, and proposed all sorts of legislation that Congress will not consider.  But not once has Nixon or a \"surrogate\" presented the American voter with a substantial, precise, or inclusive policy explanation about <i>anything.</i></span></p> <p><span>Nixon's Labor Day speech on the \"work ethic\" was so incredibly moralistic that any politician could have delivered it without saying anything worth noting.  But this sort of speech is in keeping with his continual failure to account for the past four years or to explain his plans for the next four.</span></p> <p><span>All of this is in sad contrast to the examples of some earlier campaigns--certainly of such famous ones as the 1858 Lincoln-Douglas debates.  Those men answered questions from the audience, quizzed each other on facts, and courteously but staunchly defended their philosophies, not their bank accounts.  Today, two 20th century politicians cannot or dare not present their ideas and inform America where they really stand.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Harvard Grinds and Groans Into Year 337 | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Harvard eased into its 337th Fall this week, either by the sheer momentum of time or the perserverance of its deans and administrators, or perhaps even by the grace of God.  It was a curious week for those who observed the pendulum of student activism begin its wide swing in the year and a half prior to the 1968 Presidential election.  Now, in another election year, they are witnessing the seeming return of that pendulum to a steady resting position.  But this apparent steadiness is deceiving.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard might well appear dormant by comparison to 1968.  Disinterest and confusion hamper the initial efforts of liberals trying to boost the campaign of Sen. George McGovern.  (After all, the polls--which have assumed an absurdly prominent role in a Presidential year tainted by media overkill--show Massachusetts within President Nixon's reach.)</span></p> <p><span>Radical politics, which have altered so drastically since the nationwide student strike of 1970, still lack a new forcefulness of purpose.</span></p> <p><span>And the two visible groups of 1972.  PALC and the Graduate Student Union, are planning long-range programs rather than taking immediate actions.</span></p> <p><span>There is superficial evidence to bolster the notion that students have slowed to an activist crawl.  For the past two years, SDS and PL have dropped further and further from sight.  A student strike last Spring faded out in less than a week, and an attempt to revive it in May failed utterly.</span></p> <p><span>Even the zip of the McGovern campaign has diminished over a summer in which the Democratic nominee lost the momentum of nomination in a staggering series of tactical blunders.  McGovern organizers hesitate to give specific numbers of workers because they are still measuring the losses of the summer.</span></p> <p><span>These losses are not localized:  President Nixon is discouragingly far ahead to a Democrat pondering a campaign role.  But despite the bleary immediate prospect for the McGovern campaign, despite the changing nature of activist student organizations.  Harvard is not politically detached.  More likely, its students are only now catching up to the incredibly rapid developments between 1967 and 1970--a period in which activism sifted down the educational ladder to become a new vogue for wily high school freshmen.</span></p> <p><span>The antiwar movement, which first bestirred students, raced ahead unhindered until 1970 when Nixon's strategy of delay finally exhausted its numbers but for occasional tantrums such as Mayday 1971.  Now, after a two-year breather, students are looking for new issues and new expressions of their biases--and this search hinges on a certain thoughtfulness.</span></p> <p><span>Repeated frustrations in community activism once steered black students from local organizing to the more cosmic issue of Harvard's ownership of Gulf stock.  Harvard's graduate students, who passed through college with the first wave of antiwar activists in 1967 and 1968, found a new cause in their union fight last Spring.  What remains undetermined is the direction in which undergraduates will channel political energies.</span></p> <p><span>It seems improbable that current Harvard classes are precursors of another silent generation.  They have been politicized over the past five years, and this politicization has wrought new biases.  Some students have drifted leftward while others have abandoned the radical heritage of 1967-70.  But very few have remained above the fray and as a group students will not likely resort to the political dumbfoundedness of a generation ago.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Kissinger:  The Uses of Power | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b>NYONE NEAR A TELEVISION set could see and hear Henry Kissinger this summer Apparently the White House decided that Kissinger is more frightening unseen than seen, for after three camerashy years, first the plump form and then the Germanic accent appeared in the American living room.  If the Administration had extended its logic it might have welcomed David Landau's book.  <i>Kissinger The Uses of Power,</i> but of course, the government wants not to illuminate Kissinger but merely to spotlight his more attractive points.</span></p> <p><span>So instead of heralding the first Kissinger book, the Administration defused it by announcing Landau's major disclosure four months before publication.  Through his interviews Landau last years managing editor of the <i>Crimson)</i> found that in 1967.\"  Kissinger acted as the American conduit for peace feelers from the North Vietnamese Two Frenchmen who visited Hanoi returned to Kissinger with the message that negotiations could begin if the bombing of North Vietnam ceased.  The Harvard professor brought that offer back to Washington but President Johnson rejected it only after the bloody Tet offensive of 1965 did the United states out back the bombing.</span></p> <p><span>By releasing a documented history of these communication last June, the Administration dried the juice out of Landau's best tidbit.  Indeed, the the Administration has not been very cooperative.  It is not Landau's fault that the careful research in his best chapter has become largely superfluous.  Nor is he to blame for Kissingers refusal to grant him an interview Kissingers official bashfulness, however does put a heavy strain on the book.  The effects are most severe in the biographical segment.</span></p> <p><span>Since he could not interview Kissinger, Landau was forced to rely on those who had.  The biographical portion of the first chapter is clearly indebted to such unacknowledged sources as Joseph Kraft who said very similar things in the January 1971 issue of Harper's Although Landau does not include Kraft in his bibliography and gives the syndicated columnist only two secondary footnotes on one he sets up a Kraft quote as a straw many the Harpers article like Landau's book, stressed the significance of Fritz Kraemer, an Army acquaintance and William Yandell Elliott, a Harvard professor in Kissinger's life.  The Kraft article also discussed the impact of Metternich on Kissinger policy views.</span></p> <p><span>Despite such debts, Landau has done a great deal of research and interviewed dozens of people to present the most 6. tended view of Kissinger in print.  The story of the 1967 peace feelers is now public knowledge but Landau supplements it with accounts from the French Faison and National Liberation Front officials.  By quoting frequently from Kissinger's not-for-attribution press briefings, he supplies an exclusive look at the policy maker in action.  Landau also examined Kissinger's position papers, his books and articles, and the recollections of his friends and colleagues.  Landan writes that Kissinger wanted President Kennedy to invade the Eastern Sector of Germany after the construction of the Berlin Wall.  He surveys Kissinger's contributions as an adviser to Nelson Rockefeller, and highlights the scholar's support for family bomb shelters and a visible American presence in underdeveloped countries.  For those who still had doubts.  Landau justly concludes that the \"differences in (Nixon's and Kissinger's) rhetoric did not reflect a disparity of opinion so much as they concealed a joint purpose.</span></p> <p><span><b>U</b>NFORTUNATELY, LANDAU has the habit of slapping down slick generalizations.  Such flaws pock the early chapters which are the most overwritten and least organized part of the book Glancing over two hundred years of American history and indulging rhetoric reminiscent of Nixon, Landau maintains that Kissingers is one of the most attractive voices ever to bold forth in Washington.\"  Shifting to sociology he flatly and wrongly states that America does not look at all like Weimar.  In a statement so oversimplified that it is blatantly false, he writes that Kissinger sees Nguven Van Thieu as a convenient ally not because he is reasonable but merely because he is compliant.\"  Without supporting his view, he refutes Kissingers \"linkage\" theory with the equivalent of a Papal Bull.  And it is even less reasonable to suppose that America's steadfastness in Southeast Asia measurably affects Washington's credibility in the European theater with the Soviet Union, or even with the West European allies from Europes vantage point the war is an exercise not in credibility but in irrational and absurd theatricality.</span></p> <p><span>At other times, Landau contradicts his own insights Forgetting his description of Kissinger's revulsion of ideology,\" and \"deep horror of in ternal upheavals writes one hundred pages later that the cause of the Vietnamese liberation movement national unification--is one which Kissinger reared in the European tradition of nationalism, can only have accepted as legitimate.\"  (Curiously enough, this statement is contradicted by still another specious assertion, which states that Kissinger favors a divided Germans because Germans had historically been a land and a nation divided,\" and because the native of Furth remembered \"the horror that Bismarck's artificial creation, a strong and unified Germans had imposed on the rest of the Continent in the two World Wars.\")</span></p> <p><span>Despite his clear belief that revolutionary movements are changing the shape of world politics.  Landau mouths the old cliches out \"bipolar world\" Regarding developments since the nineteenth century, he writes uncategorically.  Where multipolarity existed before, bipolarity between the Soviet Union and the United States is the central feature of current international relations.\"  Landau is similarly two-faced in his distinctions between Kennedy and Nixon foreign policy.  In a cogent passage, he recalls the \"chauvinism\" of the Kennedy Administration which pledged \"it would fight anywhere and at any time to achieve its goals.\"  The Nixon Administration is less idealistic:  it will fight only if necessary to further the overall policy of world stability.  But in the next chapter, Landau blurs the distinction by writing that \"the all-embracing obligations spelled out in the (Nixon) Doctrine demand that the role of the United States in every confrontation be particularly 'tough' or convincing.\"  Although he correctly observes that Vietnamization \"was adopted in response to the political threat which American war critics posed to the chances for compromise negotiation with the other side.\"  Landau earlier states that \"the most dangerous flaw in Kissinger's line of thinking is the belief that domestic opinion should pose no obstacles to the conduct of foreign policy.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>D</b>EVELOPING THE METTERNICH analogy.  Landau is so eager to prove that Kissinger is living in the past that he ignores the real similarities between the worlds of the two diplomats.  In perhaps his most fatuous statement.  Landau writes that in the early nineteenth century, \"the movements for popular sovereignty and self-determination had not yet reared their threatening heads.\"  But of course, without such movements, there would have been no Metternich as we know him.  The Austrian diplomat was fighting to contain just those \"movements for popular sovereignty and self-determination\" which the French Revolution had ignited.  And interestingly enough.  Metternich fought so hard because he knew that his own country, the polyethnic Austrian Empire, could not survive if legitimate monarchy was defeated and national self-determination won out.</span></p> <p><span>Landau muddles the Metternich analogy (which Joseph Kraft first presented in the unacknowledged article) because he recognizes the importance of the historical example to Kissinger but fails to realize its actual relevance to the current situation.  Landau is usually very good when he discusses the motivation behind Kissinger's policy directives.  His knowledge of Vietnamese history helps him illuminate such ironies as a proposed American peace plan which reiterates the treacherous 1946 and 1954 agreements with the French that the Vietnamese accepted to their later regret.  He appreciates the paradox of Kissinger's urge for personal, Congress of Vienna style, diplomacy that twentieth-century communications have made obsolete.  Yet he fails to see the greater irony behind the historical comparison.</span></p> <p><span>Like Metternich's Austria, Kissinger's America is attempting to squash national liberation movements in less powerful lands.  Like Metternich's Austria Kissinger's America depends for different reasons on the success of its foreign policy to insure its own domestic stability. Austria feared rightfully that Hungarians, Slavs and other national groups would rise up at home if nationalist movements were not stopped abroad.  America recognizes that its domestic stability and standard of living depend on a peaceful system of world domination.  The irony, of course, is that Metternich failed, and that with historical hindsight, we can see that his failure was inevitable.  Social and economic conditions had outdated the political structures of the Old Regime aristocracy.  An unusually intelligent man.  Metternich apparently realized the foregone failure of his enterprise.  Yet he continued crafting his policies and killing his opponents as a stalling device, knowing that once he had failed, there would be nothing remaining for him in the world.  Remembering Kissinger, with his fierce hatred of ideology and revolution, it is easy to imagine the final irony:  future historians recording the bittersweet saga of a brilliant man who fought the progress of history and sanctioned the murder of innocents to preserve the obsolete ideals so precious to him.</span></p>"}

James Dumont '75, the new student coordinator, admitted that \"I came into the job by default, it's all Jamie's doing.\"  He also reported a noticeable lack of enthusiasm among some people who had been selected to complete the campaign leadership for the fall.  He said that a couple of key people were kind of disappointed\" by McGovern's summer performance.</span></p> <p><span>Dumont now faces a number of additional organizational problems that range in seriousness from the failure of the New York Times to be regularly delivered to his office to an inability to get in touch with the majority of his volunteers.  The McGovern office no longer has the current addresses of the volunteers it recruited last year.  for most students have moved into different rooms with the new academic year.  Dumont and a few volunteers have spent the last week tracking down the new addresses of last year's workers through the various house offices and the University telephone exchange.</span></p> <p><span>The chore is close to completion but it has cost the campaign time.  As a result it has been impossible to muster enough supporters to form a Harvard contingent for a march to tomorrow's McGovern rally at Post Office Square</span></p> <p><span>However some volunteers did canvass in the North End last weekend Dumont projected that between 30 and 60 workers would show up but less than 20 came each day.  Despite the weekend's poor turnout.  Dumont was pleased by the freshman response to a table set up at registration two weeks ago.  He had his staff collect more than 350 names at that time and on September 26, at a followup meeting in the Freshman Union, over 125 people attended.  He also said that tables in the houses for upper class registration attracted about 100 new people.</span></p> <p><span>Canvassing and telephone work will be the major duties of the volunteers for the duration of the campaign.

Dean Epps has told Dumont that it would be a violation of University rules to collect funds for the state campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Like most McGovern workers.  Dumont does not have too much attention for recent public opinion polls.

Do we have enough bumper stickers.\"  Studds asked Phil Hale his 2 year old driver.</span></p> <p><span>\"Well...\"  Hale counted the stickers decided he didn't and went back in the headquarters to get some more.</span></p> <p><span>The group took off in two cars.  Betty Santos and Jeff Lavares carried the signs in one while Studds.  Hale, and Bill Guild drove in the other.  It was perfect ethnic balance:  two Portuguese from New Bedford and two Wasps one from Nantucket one from Hingham.</span></p> <p><span>\"Aerovox is a tough factory to do\" said Studds on the way over \"We can't get inside the gate and people come flying around in cars.  Studds is used to factory gates.  He has been campaigning for Congress since early 1970.  Running as a \"peace\" candidate in the '70 elections he won the Democratic Primary by a big margin over three challengers, and missed one of the biggest upsets of the year by fewer than 2000 votes to conservative Republican Congressman Hastings Keith.  Keith had run unopposed in the previous election.</span></p> <p><span>The Democratic State Legislature redistricted the Twelfth in 1971 and cut out some of the towns favorable to Keith.  So the 14-year veteran decided to retire and Studds now faces the man Keith beat in the 1970 Republican primary former State Senator William Weeks.  Weeks is grandson of former Senator John Wingate Weeks after whom the Weeks Bridge is named, and son of former U.S. Senator and Eisenhower Administration Treasury Secretary Sinclair Weeks</span></p> <p><span>Studds was right about the factory Cars did come whizzing in and Studds had to content himself with waving to their occupant.</span></p> <p><span>But some of the workers arrived on foot and he greeted them with \"Hi I'm Gerry Studds Most knew who he was and were friendly</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile two volunteers went through the factory gates into the Aerovox parking lot to \"bumpersticker\" which is Southeastern.  Massachusetts political slang for asking people if they want stickers placed on their cars.</span></p> <p><span>Another volunteer distributed leaflets to incoming workers and passers-by, while a third positioned himself near the gate with a campaign sign so drivers would know who was waving at them.</span></p> <p><span>As we walked out a man sitting at the lunch counter turned to us and said.  \"I hope he wins.  But you're going to have to work hard.  A lot of the politicians are against him.\"</span></p> <p><span>According to a Boston Globe article of September 19, many prominent Weymouth Democrats are supporting Weeks Stephen S. J. Hall.  Vice president for Administration and a strong Weeks supporter said last week that most of the members of the City Council in heavily Democratic New Bedford back the Weeks candidacy.</span></p> <p><span>One reason Weeks is making inroads into the Democratic Party is his political ability Weeks made a lot of friends during three terms in the State Senate and he now is in a position to cash in his chips.  In addition his friendly and warm personality has the ability to charm people in brief meetings.  Unlike Studds who takes a strong left-liberal position.  Weeks give, the impression of being a moderate with whom a Humphrey type Democrat could feel comfortable</span></p> <p><span>Where Weeks actually differs with President Nixon is unclear.  He said in an interview last week that \"I could support him on a great many issues and would oppose him on others,\" but he could only cite one issue where he differed specifically with the President.</span></p> <p><span>On the war in Vietnam.  Weeks would end U.S. military involvement if the North Vietnamese release the prisoners of war.  Nixon's current position is that he would only withdraw troops if a cease fire were negotiated and the prisoners were released.</span></p> <p><span>On other issues it appears likely that Weeks--despite his appearance--would vote with the Nixon position.</span></p> <p><span>The candidates are divided on tax reform and Vietnam, Studds would have the U.S. withdraw unconditionally from Vietnam.  Both candidates talk about tax reform but Weeks is specific only, in his opposition to the oil depletion allowance, while Studds also favors heavier taxes on capital gains.  Studds portrays the choice as one between a Nixon Republican and a liberal Democrat, while Weeks sees the decision as one between a moderate and an ultra-liberal.</span></p> <p><span>In order to bring his message to the voters, Weeks is banking heavily on the strong grass roots organization which his campaign staff claims it is developing in all parts of the district, Hall originally designed the campaign's organization plan with the hope of having a coordinator for every 20 households in the district.  A campaign consultant from Washington subsequently decided that it would be preferable to give campaign workers the responsibility for 50 households.</span></p> <p><span>The Weeks campaign is very well financed, and should their grass roots organization falter, the Cohasset Republican can afford to rely heavily on advertising.</span></p> <p><span>Studds has a very strong local organization, which he began building in his campaign against Keith.  He has kept it in fact by continuous use through 1971.</span></p> <p><span>But one of his problems appears to be the overconfidence of potential supporters.  In 1970, everyone knew that much work had to be done if Studds was to approach winning.  This year, popular wisdom holds that Studds is a sure winner.  It makes it tougher to persuade people to get out and canvass again.</span></p> <p><span>How much of a factor the Presidential campaign will be is unclear.</span></p> <p><span>Should McGovern falter, his presence on the ticket could hurt the heavily favored Studds.</span></p>"}

Kearns, assistant professor of Government.</span></p> <p><span>Kearns is one of five Harvard associates whom Richard E. Neustadt, professor of Government and acting chairman of the Democratic Platform Committee, has asked to do research on various issues for the 1972 Democratic Party platform.</span></p> <p><span>The other Harvard associates are Elisabeth K. Allison, lecturer in Business Administration:  Lance M. Liebman, assistant professor of Law:  Marc J. Roberts '64, assistant professor of Economics:  and James Vorenberg '49, professor of Law.</span></p> <p><span>Neustadt said last week that individuals associated with Harvard, including the five research associates and several graduate students, comprise about a quarter of the Platform Committee's research staff.</span></p> <p><span>Kearns, who worked in the White House during the waning days of the Johnson Administration and was involved in the 1968 Kennedy campaign, said her section on \"Government and the People\" would include discussion of electoral reform, government decentralization, security and classification, and regulatory agencies.</span></p> <p><span>\"It will deal with the whole notion of political process--how to redistribute power by breaking down old institutions and building up new ones,\" she said.</span></p> <p><span>\"You can't reorganize from the top.  We've done that for 40 years and nothing's happened because the power base hasn't changed,\" Kearns contended.  \"You have to redistribute power to the citizens and force change on the government from the outside.  That means giving them resources of power besides the vote--money, knowledge, communications.\"</span></p> <p><span>At the suggestion of Samuel H. Beer, Eaton Professor of Government, Kearns read the 1912 Progressive Party and 1896 Populist Party platforms, which she said were much closer to the mood of the 1970's than more recent platforms.</span></p> <p><span>\"From Teddy Roosevelt's 1912 platform you sense that the political process had gotten away from the people while the Populists captured the contemporary economic dissent,\" she said.  In contrast, Kearns said, the platforms of the 1960's exuded a basic confidence in the existing political system.</span></p> <p><span>Vorenberg, \"moderately active\" as a Democratic speech writer in the past, said that the plank on \"Law, Crime and Justice\" which he is researching would probably oppose Federal block grants to local criminal justice agencies.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, he said, the Party might propose that incentives be tied to the Federal funding so that localities might reform their administration of justice.</span></p> <p><span>\"For instance, there is a major commitment to imprisonment now.

I realize that I can't recall a single portion of the 1968 platform except for the Vietnam plank,\" she remarked.</span></p> <p><span>The O'Hara Commission, formed after the 1968 Democratic Convention, mandated the hearings and new procedures of Platform Committee selection.  The McGovern Commission introduced reforms in the delegate selection process.</span></p> <p><span>\"We've been caught between two reforms.\"  Neustadt said.  \"The O'Hara Commission assumed delegates would be selected early while the McGovern Commission provided that they were chosen late.\"</span></p> <p><span>As a result, the hearings had to begin before all the Convention delegates were chosen in order to finish by June 23, the first full meeting of the Platform Committee.</span></p> <p><span>Each of the research associates will attend several of the Platform Committee's 15 hearings, including the one that deals with his area of interest.  At the hearings, to be held during the next month in various cities across the country, local members of the 150-man Platform Committee will listen to testimony from experts in different fields.</span></p> <p><span>Each hearing consists of a morning session that considers a specific national issue like \"Education\" or \"Taxes\" and an afternoon session devoted to regional problems.</span></p> <p><span>The New England regional hearing began yesterday at Faneuil Hall in Boston and dealt with \"Rights.  Opportunities and Political Power.\"  The final session in Boston is scheduled for this morning on \"Education.\"</span></p> <p><span>The research associates will also consult experts in the field, Congressional personnel, interest groups, and past party platforms in defining the issues in their areas.

{"title": "A Byrd in the Hand Is Worth Thieu in the Bush | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>T WAS LUNCHTIME on Capitol Hill.  As four men strode out of the elevator in the Rayburn Building, they passed several members of the Harvard-Radcliffe Lobby resting from a morning's lobbying efforts.</span></p> <p><span>\"That's fucking Mel Laird!\"  a lobbyist muttered, and after a quick doubletake the students took off in pursuit of the Cabinet officer and his three civilian companions.  Mel was coming down the backstretch as the students turned the corner, but they were closing fast.  As the margin between hawk and dove narrowed, civility was sacrificed to national security.  A white-haired onlooker with a white-sideburned smile yelled, \"Run, Mel.\"  The closest student questioned Laird at a dogtrot.  \"Mr. Secretary, I am very concerned about the national defense.\"  \"I'm sorry, the Secretary is half an hour late for an important mission.  He can't hold an interview just now,\" an aide answered.  \"But I'd just like to know what concessions were made to the Soviets in exchange for no minesweepers....\" \"I'm very sorry, I'm all tied up right now.\"  The Secretary managed an impatient smile, picked up the pace even more, and disappeared around a corner.</span></p> <p><span>The meeting with Laird was an unexpected part of the students' efforts to talk with key legislators about recent developments in the Vietnam War.  Laird's response was characteristic of the reaction the 50 Harvard students received during their two-day lobbying effort.</span></p> <p><span>The Lobby grew out of a meeting of students in Adams House the night after the most recent Nixon war-message.  By the time arrangements to go to Washington had been made, exams and papers cut into the initial enthusiasm for protest in Washington.  Five hundred dwindled to fifty, five buses dwindled to one, and faculty support was financial rather than vocal.</span></p> <p><span>Mark Talisman '63, former fellow of the Institute of Politics and administrative aide to Congressman Charles Vanik (D-Ohio), had strongly encouraged students to come to Washington to express support for pending antiwar legislation.  \"I really am terribly dismayed that there are so few people from Harvard here,\" Talisman remarked.</span></p> <p><span>In May of 1970, in response to similar Presidential acts of war and similar congressional pleas, over 1500 Harvard students and faculty members had come to Washington.</span></p> <p><span>\"Try to make up for lack of numbers with knowledge and good argument,\" was Talisman's advice to the 50 students.</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard-Radcliffe Lobby focused mainly on urging undecided Senators to reject the amendment which had been introduced last week by Senator Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.) to the Case-Church antiwar proposals.  The Case-Church Bill unamended, provided for the complete withdrawal of all U.S. military assistance to Indochina, contingent only upon an agreement with the North Vietnamese for the release of prisoners.  Byrd's amendment added a ceasefire agreement to the conditions for American withdrawal.  It therefore expressed de facto approval for withdrawal conditions set by President Nixon two weeks ago.  Some of the Harvard lobbyists would have preferred to support an alternative to the President's policies which included provision for serious negotiations and a coalition government in Saigon.  Given the alternatives under Senate consideration when the lobby arrived in Washington however, it chose to defend Church-Case.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>O COMPENSATE for their numerical weakness, one Minnesota student perfected a Texas drawl before meeting with Senator John Towers's (R-Texas) legislative assistant.</span></p> <p><span>\"Ah'm from Dallas, Ah'd like to talk to Senator Towers about th'War...Ah'm concerned about the safety of U.S. troops in Vietnam, and Ah don't think the bombing of China Railroads will protect them,\" the student drawled.</span></p> <p><span>The aide, who is a consultant to a Boston firm now designing a nuclear war game, assured the student \"confidentially\" that a $200,000 laser bomb recently developed by the military would be accurate enough to \"do the job\".  The student smiled and urged that the Senator vote against the Byrd Amendment so that money now being wasted in Indochina could be spent on more <i>useful</i> military projects.  Despite the student's plea.  Towers decided to vote for the Byrd Amendment.</span></p> <p><span>Other lobbying techniques were more straightforward than the Texas drawl.  Jackets, ties, and newly exposed knees cloaked the student efforts in the garments of respectability.  The lobbyists were also careful to prepare their arguments well.</span></p> <p><span>In spite of it all, their reception was disappointing.  The atmosphere on the Hill was filled with a strange mixture of resentment and paranoia.  Police, office personnel, and elected officials, well prepared for militant demonstrations, were suspicious of the long-haired delegation.  Capitol Hill guards thoroughly inspected all handbags and packages that were brought into the Congressional office buildings.  One student observer who had spent several summers on the Hill as a Senate intern noted that the number of police assigned to the Capitol was remarkably high, especially given the incidence of real crime in other parts of the city.</span></p> <p><span>The surplus Hill police made sure that student lobbyists crossed Constitution Ave. between the white lines.  One policeman threatened to arrest a Radcliffe student for leaning against a Rayburn Building wall while waiting for the visitors' cafeteria to open.</span></p> <p><span>Legislators' reactions occasionally were as hostile as those of the police.  A number of Ohio students waited for two hours to speak with Senator William Saxbe (R-Ohio) and were finally asked to leave.  Moments later, the request was reinforced by the arrival of ten Capitol Hill Guards, who clustered around Saxbe's door.</span></p> <p><span>Congressman Fletcher Thompson of Georgia offered his young constituents a one-way ticket to Hanoi.  \"You're all dupes of the International Communist conspiracy,\" he told them.</span></p> <p><span>Other Congressmen were less hostile but equally intractable.  Some were concerned that they might \"hamstring\" the President's journey to Moscow if they took action against the war.  Representative \"Bizz\" Johnson (D-Calif.) said, \"I was not elected to be concerned with the national interests.  That's not my subcommittee.  I'm on Parks and Recreations.\"  Congressman Albert H. Quie (R-Minn.) said that he was unaware of the antiwar legislation which had been introduced into the House.  \"I really feel the war has to end, but only the President can do it,\" he told the students.  \"What we should do is send in some good tough Marines until our other forces withdraw,\" he added.</span></p> <p><span>Senator Lowell Weicker's (R-Conn.) secretary repeated the Senator's statement that he \"does not give one whit for the lives of the North Vietnamese or the South Vietnamese.\"</span></p> <p><span>Even the more liberal legislators were not very reassuring.  A student asked a legislative aide to Senator Brooke (R-Mass.) whether anyone knew for sure if national security was in jeopardy.  \"Dr. Kissinger knows,\" the aide replied.  \"Certainly no one in Congress does.  Anything's possible, but we've honestly heard nothing.\"  This ignorance was shared by both supporters and opponents of the President's actions.  And so the students found themselves asking for action from old men whose minds were unburdened by complicated facts.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE STUDENTS continued to lobby until Tuesday afternoon, when the amendment was called to vote.  The waiting line for the Senate Gallery contained an odd assortment of people.  The vote on the Byrd Amendment was scheduled for 2 p.m.  At 1:30 p.m. a recess was called in order to see the Apollo 14 astronauts during their tour of Washington.  Because of the crowds, visitors to the gallery were only allowed to stay for fifteen minutes.  Timing was essential--one student overcompensated and at 1:55 p.m. was shuttled out of the gallery.  He spotted a friend in the line, and remarked with disgust, \"Great, I wait for hours and what do I get--astronauts!\"</span></p> <p><span>A clergyman--one of 300 members of Concerned Clergy and Laity (CCL) lobbying in Washington--was waiting with a group of friends.  \"Move along now move right along,\" a policeman said, waving his arms at the line.  \"Mooooooo, mooooooo\", responded the clergyman as he complacently ambled down the hall.</span></p> <p><span>Another policeman walked along the line telling people to check all packages.  \"Make sure you have your Visitor's Pass,\" he called.  \"You must have a pass to get in.\"  He was referring to the pink Visitor's Pass for the Ninety-second Congress Second Session; a pile of them were on each Senator's desk to hand out to their visitors.</span></p> <p><span>Reading the back of the card helped pass the time during the wait.  \"Standing or sitting in the doorways and aisles, smoking, applause, reading, taking notes, taking of photographs, and the wearing of hats by men are prohibited\" the back of the card curiously stated.  \"No hats, coats, or other objects may be placed on the railings; visitors are prohibited from leaning forward over the railing or placing their hands thereon.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Hey, we can breathe,\" one student pointed out.</span></p> <p><span>At 2 p.m. a roll call was taken on the Senate floor.  At 2:05 p.m. another roll call was taken.  After a third roll call, the vote was taken.  Silence filled the gallery while the Senators voted on the amendment.  The \"swing\" Senators were scrutinized by students who had spent time with them discussing the amendment.</span></p> <p><span>But the Administration had done some lobbying too.  That morning a number of undecided Senators had met with Presidential Advisor Henry A. Kissinger '50, and Secretary of State William P. Rogers.</span></p> <p><span>When the final vote was in, the Byrd Amendment had passed, 4<illegible>43.  As disappointed students began to file out of the gallery.  Senator Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.) immediately took the floor and introduced a new amendment cutting off funds to Indochina.  Unfortunately, the language of the bill was such that no one could quite understand it.  In one portion of the gallery, ten people stood up and called out, \"God speed, end the war,\" before leaving.  The president of the session called for order.  Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott (R-Penn.) stood up, interrupting Mansfield, and denounced further introduction of antiwar legislation.  He added to the confusion by referring to the Vietnamese as Koreans. <p>At one point Scott talked of the 1954 advance of the North Koreans across the 17th Parallel against the South Koreans.  An aide leaned over and murmured something in his ear. </p><p>\"Oh, I mean Vietnamese,\" Scott hastily added, and almost immediately lapsed back into discussion of the North Korean invasions. </p><p><b>T</b>RED AFTER TWO NIGHTS of communal snoring on the hard floors of one Union Methodist Church, the Harvard students retreated from Capitol Hill after the Byrd vote late Tuesday afternoon. </p><p>They had come, seen, and learned that ambitious little men in grandiose offices are content to permit the War to run its course, lies, dresses, and polite conversation are not enough.

Edward Brooke (R-Mass.) pointed out:  \"Congress has abdicated a large part of its power, partly because it can't seem to agree on anything.\"  With such internal confusion, does lobbying help?</span></p> <p><span>\"The Democratic Caucus restricting Nixon's war powers happened <i>only</i> because of lobbying.\"  Mark Talisman, administrative assistant to Rep. Charles Vanik (D-Ohio) told the students at a briefing Monday morning.  \"If that isn't proof.  I don't know what is.\"</span></p> <p><span>The lobbyists concentrated both on persuading Congressmen to co-sponsor the Drinan-Gravel Resolution--which is still frozen in committee-- and on urging undecided, or \"swing,\" senators to vote down the Byrd Amendment to the pending Case-Church Amendment.  The Byrd Amendment makes cutoff of Congressional funds contingent upon a ceasefire agreement, and lobbyists felt it greatly weakened the original move.  But Washington did some lobbying of its own.  Tuesday morning Administration officials, including Presidential Adviser Henry A. Kissinger '50 and Secretary of State William P. Rogers, met with selected \"swing\" Senators.  Tuesday afternoon the Byrd Amendment passed, 47-43.</span></p> <p><span>Congressional reaction to the lobbyists varied from Vanik's offer of his office as a coordinating center, to Rep.

And finding no apparent answer, he decided to join in the non-violent, obstructive sit-ins at Westover Air Force Base in Chicopee, 15 miles from the Amherst campus.</span></p> <p><span>Ward's subsequent arrest in the Westover antiwar action last week caused quite a stir:  The New York Times ran the text of a speech he made explaining his participation in the sit-in on its op-ed page, and college professors and administrators around the country reacted with curious \"Hmmm's\" and sympathetic \"Oh really's?\".</span></p> <p><span>In Boston on Monday, 300 college professors marched to the State House to lobby and demand an end to the war.  Their patience was evidently wearing thin.</span></p> <p><span>Not to be outdone, the presidents of the eight Ivy League colleges followed suit in a more traditional form of protest this week.  Taking a cue, perhaps, from their more militant colleague at Amherst, the Ivy presidents joined with Stanford's Richard Lyman and headed for Washington Wednesday to lobby against the war.</span></p> <p><span>President Bok explained that the group was trying to convey the feeling that \"students are not apathetic toward this war.\"  But surely, in an hour and a half of head-butting with Presidential Advisor Henry Kissinger, Bok and the other presidents must have realized that this road of protest has been travelled many times before.  It is difficult to see how yet another trip down the beaten path could reap more tangible results than previously.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, many feel that the path is a deadend.  The worn tactics--lobbying (by students or by college presidents), obstructive sit-ins, and certainly aimless violence--now have questionable influence on the decisions that are made in the offices that count in Washington.  What they do influence is the way Nixon foists those decisions on the public.  The reaction to the Cambodian incursion of 1970 did not instruct Nixon not to invade Laos six months later; rather it taught him how to time his actions and manage the press.  Strategy seems sometimes to focus more on what the Administration can get away with than on what course it should, in good conscience, pursue.</span></p> <p><span>The biggest antiwar actions of the spring are scheduled for Sunday and Monday.  The turnout is difficult to predict, but it will likely be negligible because this spring of action has grown old very fast.

{"title": "THE PROTEST VOTE | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The campaign of 1972 actually began more than a year ago when George McGovern announced his candidacy to a disinterested electorate which was not expected to pay him the least notice.  At that nearly forgotten moment, all the political talk centered on Muskie's chances at unseating Nixon, and the Democratic party seemed to have found it's position again as the spokesman for slightly liberal America.  But times have changed at an alarming pace:  Nixon has reopened the war issues with bombs over Haiphong, and the slumbering American left, and right, have found their respective voices again.  These voices were echoed in sotes for McGovern and for George Wallace, while Muskie has been found among the casualties of the primary battle.  It is Wallace and McGovern who have found themselves at the forefront of American politics in 1972, for they speak for those who have found themselves ignored, for those who protest the road their country is travelling.</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday's primary in Oregon has reaffirmed the predominant position of two men who have never been taken too very seriously in the past.  George McGovern has risen into the seemingly untenable position of frontrunner, calling for shows of \"massive support\" in order to maintain it.  George Wallace has become the most influential third force the campaign has seen, and his calls to \"Send Them A Message\" have found their echo in the votes of the many previously unrepresented who find him the only true choice offered in American politics.  Both of these men combine a broad populist program with an earthy, honest approach, and the parallelism of their success can be traced to basic similarities.  The effect of both on the politics of 1972 is difficult to predict; and now both find themselves watching from unaccustomed positions, one from a hospital bed, the other from the front-runner spot.</span></p>"}

For anyone interested in how the Army functions and how it investigates itself.  Hersh's book is required reading.</span></p> <p><span>For high officers of the Americal, the fear that publicizing the deaths of women and children at My Lai would ruin their careers stimulated them to stay silent.  When Colonel Henderson asked General Koster, commander of the Americal, why the general had countermanded the colonel's order to have troops return to count bodies during the afternoon of the day of the killings, Koster answered that he did not think it was so important to find out how the \"twenty\" died.  The number was actually between 200 and 400.</span></p> <p><span>For lower-ranking officers and enlisted men, a stream of medals rewarded their gallantry against the unarmed civilians--thereby buying their silence as well.</span></p> <p><span>Consider, for example, the case of helicopter pilot Thompson, who landed his craft in the midst of the slaughter by the Americal and who had his machine gunner train his weapon on Lietenant Calley.  Calley was made to abstain from shooting 10 women and children whom Thompson whisked away to safety in his helicopter.  Even though he had initially filed a report with superiors which condemned the killings, Thompson submitted another statement that the rescued civilians were hiding in a bunker \"located between friendly and hostile forces engaged in a heavy fire fight.\" Thompson won the Distinguished Flying Cross, even though he had to invent the \"heavy\" fire fight to do so.</span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>ERSH shows clearly how the self-serving attitudes of the Peers commission members mirrored those of the officers and men of the Americal.  Peers would not allow Vietnam war opponents to testify, and one of the commission members--who went out of his way to self-righteously upbraid the officers of the Americal--is now himself accused of \"failure to comply with written directions in connection with the murder in 1969...of at least five Vietnamese prisoners and electric torture of a sixth.\"</span></p> <p><span>Typical of the coziness among high-ranking officers in the army was the pardoning of General Koster by General Seaman, the commander at Fort Meade, Maryland.  Seaman's pardon forgave Koster on the basis of the \"fact\" that everything Koster had done, including not reporting the massacre to his superiors, was \"understandable\" given the circumstances.</span></p> <p><span>Even while the Peers Commission was still conducting hearings into the massacre at My Lai 4, the army hushed up a massacre on a somewhat smaller scale at My Khe 4 humlet.  Since the Nixon administration and the Army have taken such a lax attitude toward justice in the cases of Vietnamese civilians slaughtered by U.S. troops, it will be interesting to see just what course \"justice\" takes in post-Vietnam war America toward the Americans.</span></p>"}

{"title": "You Must Remember...This? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>B</b>ELIEVE ME, there's no love lost between me and '72.  With only the possible exception of 1961 (during which all I can remember doing is sitting glumly about while awaiting the onset of puberty), '71-72 must go on record as the most boring and undistinguished year I've yet had the displeasure to meet.  Phillip Schorsch, stolen termpapers, <i>Dirty Harry--</i>you can't tell me memories are made of this.</span></p> <p><span>But while I'm not inclined to sing an ode to '72, I would like to right a few wrongs.  For no matter how down you are on this underachiever of a year, the current yearbook is bound to reignite your sympathies, if only because this year's yearbook--winningly titled <i>Three Thirty Six--</i>is even more resolutely boring than the year whose story it tells.  Consider the case of Mr. Derek Curtis Bok.  To read <i>Three Thirty Six,</i> one might conclude that the aforesaid Bok appeared on campus only once this year--for a brief, tasteful installation ceremony--before retiring primly into the never-neverland of Massachusetts Hall.  Nowhere is there mention of Ms. Bok, of the General Counsel, of the Three Vice-Presidents, of the Seven Special Assistances, of the hobbits and the orcs and all the other creatures who this year descended on the realm of Harvard to free her from the darkness of the days of the morbid Nathan.  Nor--for that matter--is there any mention of the university-wide financial crisis, the Design School show-down, Samuel Popkin vs. federal grand juries, the Graduate Students' Union, the PALC demands, HEW guidelines, Radcliffe-Harvard ratios.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, <i>Three Thirty Six</i> presents what it calls \"News Flashes\" that summarily feature Daniel Ellsberg, Larry Dicara, B.F. Skinner (complete with University News Office photo), the New Hampshire Primaries, Richard Herrnstein, and Misha Petkavich.  Along the way, <i>Three Thirty Six</i> reminds us that \"Most of us cherish the idea of free will,\" that \"New Hampshire voters like to be wooed,\" and that students \"have given up protest because it is just not as much fun as blowing weed and making love.\"  Darling, shall we join the action against the JFK Building tomorrow?  Oh no, dearest, I'd much prefer we stay home and blow weed.</span></p> <p><span>I can see you about to charge me with wrenching such examples out of context.  Well, I'll admit you may have me there.  But then it is very hard to determine whether <i>Three Thirty Six</i> has any context at all.  I mean it comes out of an office in between Ivy Films and McGovern for President and it seems to spend half its time billing parents, taking portraits, and selling its product, but as for a theme...or a concept...or a unifying principle...well, I guess there just wasn't time.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HEY DID TAKE some pictures.  You know the sort of thing:  John Harvard covered with snow, freshman dorms covered with snow, the Radcliffe Yard covered with snow.  And they kept the copy brief and the margins clean and white.  But if you don't know exactly what games the Harvard Football Team lost or whom the crew defeated on the Nile or how the Russian Bells got to Lowell House in the first place, <i>Three Thirty Six</i> doesn't offer much assistance.  Even worse are its vignettes of House life, which sound as if they are describing a string of Holiday Inns.  Take Eliot House, for example:  \"Along with a fine physical setup--rooms, courtyard, grill, etc.--there seems to be a new spirit among the residents.\"  Or perhaps you prefer North House:  \"North House may well be the most together house in the university.\"  So visit.  Harvard, where tired students unwind...</span></p> <p><span><i>Three Thirty Six</i> has no feel for the textures of Harvard life.  One essay on the subject, \"Creeping Sentimentalism,\" makes a few token gestures in that direction--summoning up memories of the Golden Age of Paine Hall, of the '69 Strike's Six Demands, of Turkey DeLuxes and Baskin-Robbins--but it remains a stone skittering across the surface of our common experience.  Not that I want to tell you guys how to run your show, but I do envy you the time and money that go into your project.  You should be able to produce a record of the past year that is a thoughtful, compelling distillation of the passing confusions.  You could be doing high class journalism as well as discovering aspects of Harvard life that generally go unnoted (your sensitive treatment of the B &amp; G worker is a good example of both, so it's no coincidence that it is also the best thing in the current book).  Instead you appear to be writing off the top of your heads, taking pictures only at your own convenience.  So, OK, enough of this blowing weed and making love.  Maybe next year you should try putting together a yearbook.  Who knows, maybe '73 will even do something to deserve one.</span></p>"}

Marshall first proposed the plan, which sent $22 billion in aid to Europe, at Harvard's Commencement exercises on June 5, 1947.  Marshall's proposal came in addition to scheduled Commencement activities, and most of those in attendance failed to realize the immediate importance of his announcement.</span></p> <p><span>Brandt is here today at President Bok's invitation.  His speech is being billed as a major address on European-American relations, although its contents are being withheld until the convocation.</span></p> <p><span>Reliable sources indicate that Brandt will not discuss foreign policy, but will focus instead on the establishment of a program in West European Studies, funded by the German government, to reciprocate the American initiative embodied in the Marshall Plan.</span></p> <p><span>The Marshall Plan counterbalanced the threat of Russian expansion into Europe following World War II.  It called upon Europeans to join in drawing up their own plans for post-war recovery.</span></p> <p><span>The Plan proposed that the U.S. offer economic aid to combat \"not...any country or doctrine but...hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos.\"  However, most historians view it as a response to Russian overtures in Europe.</span></p> <p><span>In his Commencement speech, Marshall said:  \"It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace.\"</span></p> <p><span>Because Brandt is coming expressly for the convocation, which is closed to the public, his sojourn does not constitute an official state visit and thus skirts usual protocol.</span></p> <p><span>While a State Department representative will greet Brandt, neither President Nixon, nor Secretary of State Willian P. Rogers will see Brandt.  Henry A. Kissinger '50, the President's National Security Advisor, is vacationing with Nixon in Key Biscayne, Florida, and will not be here today.</span></p> <p><span>Brandt arrived in Boston yesterday afternoon on a German Air Force jet, accompanied by an entourage which includes Kurt Birrenbach, an official in the Christian Democratic Party, and Alex Moeller, Brandt's Foreign Minister of Finance.</span></p> <p><span>Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Walter Scheel was scheduled to join the group, but an infected knee prevented him from making the trip.</span></p> <p><span>President Bok, Boston Mayor Kevin White, and John Richard, assistant secretary of state for cultural affairs, greeted Brandt's party at the airport yesterday.  Brandt attended a small party given by personal friends last night.</span></p> <p><span>Brandt stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel under tight security last night.  The German Secret Service has also imposed stringent security arrangements for this morning's convocation and for a private luncheon in Brandt's honor, hosted by President and Mrs. Bok, which follows at the Busch-Reisinger Museum.  He will return to Germany tonight.</span></p> <p><span>Brandt has been to Harvard once before, in 1963, when he received an honorary doctor of laws degree.  He was Governing Mayor of Berlin at the time</span></p>"}
{"title": "McGOVERN IS ANATHEMA | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>To the Editors of the Crimson:</span></p> <p><span>The recent almost overwhelming vote for Senator McGovern in Massachusetts both (quite frankly) makes me question the wisdom of giving the vote to 18 year olds:  and also confirms my earlier opinion, that whereas President Kennedy may have been a courageous President, the Kennedy tradition is beginning to corrupt American politics, because it is based on too many myths.</span></p> <p><span>One way or another, Senator McGovern will only succeed in splitting the Democratic Party still further, whereas Mr. Muskie would not have done this.  There are too many conservative Democrats to whom Mr. McGovern is anathema, for a McGovern candidacy to have a real chance of success in November.</span></p> <p><span>Why is this so?  Perhaps the reason is that American liberalism no longer has the power to draw people as it used to.  People see evidence of a lack of common sense in too great a demand for freedom.  Also, I think, many people have found the changes of the last few years too hard to adjust to; they demand a slower pace to progress, and more compromises.  This explains a lot of the drawing power of Governor Wallace.</span></p> <p><span>As to the 18 year old vote, it seems to me it would be a good thing if the present generation learned to respect the wisdom of its predecessors, and even those who are now in their seventies and eighties!

McGovern Is Optimisitc | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>MIAMI BEACH--The transformation which by late yesterday had turned the Doral from a plush resort hotel to Senator George McGovern's frantic campaign headquarters began here Saturday.</span></p> <p><span>Wires snaked across the carpeted lobby, parking lots filled with staff cars and TV mobile units.  What had been a tidy meeting room became the McGovern operations center, desks twitching with the action and sound of telephones, typing and talk.</span></p> <p><span>McGovern arrived here Saturday at 3 p.m.  The weather was stormy, McGovern was confident.  \"Now in all probability, this will be a hard fought campaign...but we intend to conduct ourselves from this moment forward with dignity,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>At a press conference immediately following his arrival. McGovern told reporters at the Doral there could be no compromise on the California challenge which threatens 151 of his delegates.  \"The American sense of fair play and rule of law are now in the hands of delegates,\" he said, but he also said he was confident that he would win.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout the afternoon, McGovern was assaulted by throngs of reporters.  Saturday night he conducted staff meetings which held die-hards until 4 a.m.  By Sunday the confidence had worn thin when he met the press again in the morning with Rep. Ronald Dellums (D-Calif.), McGovern had stopped stating and started proclaiming.  \"The issue at stake here is not simply the future of a single candidate, but the future and the integrity and the quality of the odest and largest political party in this country.\"</span></p> <p><span>Democratic National Chairman Lawrence F. O'Brein's ruling that 1433 delegates and not 1509 would constitute a majority in deciding the California challenge came as a comfort to McGovern forces, except that by yesterday, the whole California question had become a chicken and egg type of problem.  The 1433 figure would undoubtedly be challenged by stop-McGovern forces, yet who would vote on what the majority of those eligible to vote was to be?  And who was eligible to vote in the preliminary rule voting?</span></p> <p><span>The McGovern staff left these problem to the Democratic National Committee and went intently on its business of talking to delegates--pleading, cojoling, coaxing.  One Nevada delegate who described herself as \"wavering\" said she had received over 30 phone calls Sunday from both parties in the California dispute.</span></p> <p><span>Sunday night, the McGovern staff poured into the Doral Hotel for yet another staff meeting, and a late reading on the programs made that day.  It became difficult to get elevators, and when they came they were filled with McGovern staffers who wore white staff buttons, good only for the mezzanine operations room, and the coveted red staff buttons which get you onto the 16th floor.</span></p> <p><span>To get beyond that to the penthouse where McGovern and his top staff hold out, you've got to be very smooth or very important.  The Secret Service stops all traffic on the 16th floor.  Secret Servicemen don't bluff.  They are everywhere--in boats, helicopters, bushes and cars, and cordoning off the stairwell of the hotel.</span></p> <p><span>The last word from the McGovern staff before the final meeting to prepare Monday's struggle was from campaign aide Pierre Salinger who admitted that there might be problems if a majority of 1509 was to decide the California challenge, but there would be none with a 1433 figure.  Either way, he was still talking confidently.  \"I don't share the general feeling that it's first ballot or nothing,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout Sunday night and yesterday, McGovern volunteers were left to mimeograph, find and call.  Onlookers milled in the brilliantly lit lobby of the Doral admist the fake Louis XIV furniture, and the McGovern staff, high stop the green glass flanks of the hotel, directed the massive California effort which groped frantically through every bleached hotel lobby along the beach</span></p>"}
{"title": "Delegate Dispute Opens Convention | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>MIAMI BEACH--The Democrats opened their National Convention here last night amid please for unity and a restoration of trust in American politics, but the prospect of a 20-hour session to settle a bitter credentials dispute dampened the spirit of the delegates.</span></p> <p><span>Shortly before 11 p.m., Democratic National chairman Lawrence F. O'Brien ruled in favor of a role call on a challenge to the South Caronlina delegation which sought to seat two additional women.  It is generally agreed here that the outcome of that rold call will be a precursor of Senator George McGovern's relative strength in the crucial California challenge.</span></p> <p><span>O'Brien brought credentials committee chairwoman Patricia Robert Harris to the podium at 10:08 p.m., but her opening words following polite applause set a weary tone.</span></p> <p><span>\"I hope uou feel that way about 10 a.m., she said in response to the applause.  And as floor managers for front-running McGovern mounted a determined effort to reclaim 151 California delegates, anti-McGovern forces dug in to buck that effort.</span></p> <p><span>One dispute here centered on O'Brien's decision Sunday that the unchallenged California delegates could vote on the California question, and further, that 1450 delegate votes--or half of those delegates voting on the challenge--constituted a majority on the question.</span></p> <p><span>At press time, the convention was beginning to debate on the California challenge, and everyone at Miami Convention Hall was prepared to remain here, if necessary, straight through to today's second session at which the Platform Committee's report will be presented.</span></p> <p><span>The debates and voting on the early challenges moved unhindered, as Humphrey strategists laid is wait for the California challenge--what amounted to a one-shot bid to stop McGoverns.  But Humphrey's managers, rocked by O'Brien's decision, were saying privately that they doubted a victory on the California question was still possible, and a loss, most observers agree, would almost surely lead to McGovern's nomination Wednesday night.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout the weekend, McGovern workers and their counterparts in the Humphrey, Muskie, Chisholm and Wallace camps maneuvered for positions in anticipation of last night's challenges.  O'Brien's decision was viewed as a significant victory for increasingly competent McGovern advisers; his delegate counter, Rick Steams, maintained that the Senator has 1470 firm delegate votes, which would almost assure him the California victory under O'Brien's rules.</span></p> <p><span>Tension over the impending credentials fight began to mount again early yesterday.  Senator Edmund S. Muskie, who has played a mysterious role of equivocation since his arrival here, called upon his fellow candidates to meet with him at 1 p.m. to work toward a compromise, thereby avoiding a convention floor debacle.</span></p> <p><span>Muskie's call netted no result.  Neither McGovern nor his chief adversary, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey chose to attend.  Others demurred:  Alabama Governor George Wallace, displaying his old fiestiness at his first extended press conference since arriving in miami was not award of Muskie's invitation.</span></p> <p><span>Wallace, though gaunt, was alert as he met with the press following a meeting at which he reassured the Alabama Delegation of his intention to support the California challenge and to press for a toned down platform tonight.</span></p> <p><span>He was indefinite about how much campaigning he would do this fall if not nominated, but he emphasized that he would support the Democratic nominee on \"the same basis as Senator McGovern\"--meaning that the Convention must measure up to his notions of responsibility.</span></p> <p><span>Humphrey, for all his determined scuffing pointed toward blocking McGovern's nomination, has been unsettled by his inability to establish a firm anti-McGovern coalition.  His aides still say privately that Muskie is the weakest link in the ad hoc movement; they have also become leary of the wavering Black Bloc votes.</span></p> <p><span>Rep. Ronald Dellums's (D-Calif.) bolt to MCGovern from Rep. Shirley Chisbolm was the only surface shift before last night's session.  His interest in upholding in another kind of coalition--one founded on the theory that McGovern is the strongest candidate at the Convention and thus has the best chance to unity the Party against President Nixon--is shared by many uncommitted delegates.</span></p> <p><span>The real worry over the Black Bloc, however, is that it will hold out from either camp.  Humphrey released his black delegates to Chisholm at the Black Caucus yesterday morning, a reflection of the pressure being applied by black leaders hoping to create a powerful lobby on the Convention floor.</span></p> <p><span>For his part, McGovern met with the Women's Cancus yesterday in an attempt to hold its votes in line.  He continues to press hard for the backing of the Mack lobby.</span></p> <p><span>The McGovern staff want into planing sessions late Sunday night to map out final strategy for last night's challenges.  Emerging late yesterday morning, they felt confident that they could roundup the delegates necessary to defeat not only the California challenge but others as well.</span></p> <p><span>The predominant feeling was that the South Carolins challenge--the first on the schedule, brought by the National Women's Caucus--would be an early, and perhaps decisive, indicator of McGovern's strength throughout the challenges.</span></p> <p><span>The McGovern staff devoted most of its efforts to tightening its communications network, which is commanded from three trailors behind Convention Hall.  By late yesterday morning, a staff member had been assigned to each delegation, with the emphasis centering on pressuring Muskie, trying to woo the 275 delegates he holds.</span></p> <p><span>McGovern himself is heading the effort to win Muskie, and if any deal is made, he will do the dealing.</span></p> <p><span>The protest groups cut out of formal Convention activites began demonstrations Sunday night.  A group of about 200 demonstrators from Flamingo Park marched outside the Playboy Plaza Hotel north of Democratic National Headquarters, then headed towards the headquarters before being turned away by a line of riot-equipped police.</span></p> <p><span>The group, led by SDS but augmented by about 100 young blacks from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference campment adjacent to Convention Hall, was mostly peaceful</span></p>"}

The best hotels are exorbitantly expensive; the less desirable hotels provide few services for a slightly smaller nightly rate.  Everywhere there are gimmicks and sometimes blanket policies affect the hotels.  For instance, some penalize guests who are discovered with liquor bought outside the hotel in their rooms.  The difference in price between liquor outside and inside the hotel proper usually runs about 100 per cent.</span></p> <p><span>Transportation is expensive and parking is almost nonesistent.  Traffic has worsened every day since last Thursday when the influx of Democrats began, and it will get worse as the week progresses.  People move in droves, pressing close to candidates as they drift from meeting to meeting.  Others opt for poolside sun, or just remain in their rooms waiting for each convention session.</span></p> <p><span>Almost universally, the delegates, campaign workers, demonstrators and media who have arrived here in the last week are awed by the superficiality of this transient city where the median age of permanent residents is sixty-five.  Those who have been here for any length of time were plain bored by yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>The boredom stemmed largely from the confusion which dominates this Convention, a confusion of conflicting political forces in a party divided over credential and platform issues.  Only a few persons with access to the candidates seemed confident that they had any inkling of what really was going on here prior to last night's opening session.  The rest wandered aimlessly about looking for something to do.</span></p> <p><span>Until last night, little was happening on the surface, Campaigning was limited.  Candidates and their entourages worked mostly to collect stray delegates by phone or in person, and candidates appeared only before groups which represented sizeable blocks of delegate vote such as the Black Caucus, the National Welfare Rights Organization, or state caucuses.</span></p> <p><span>For one group of people here, the last week--and indeed the entire Convention--has taken on a frustrating character.  The group is composed of the young volunteers, mostly those who propelled Senator George McGovern from obscurity a year and a half ago to the verge of the Democratic nomination.</span></p> <p><span>In Miami Beach, the McGovern youths have been excluded from the crucial subsurface negotiation and strategizing which comprise the crux of any convention.  Most of the primary field workers were told by the national staff to by-pass the convention altogether.  But many were brought here to allow for contingencies:  the predicted turnout of demonstrators, last minute canvassing, and errand running.</span></p> <p><span>Thomas P.Southwick '71, who joined the McGovern campaign last fall and is in charge of overseeing demonstrators' Flamingo Part campsite for McGovern, had a small staff set aside expressly to \"keep the people in Flamingo Park happy\" When only 600 of a forecasted 10,000 demonstrators arrived.  Southwick's staff become superfluous.</span></p> <p><span>\"We were already to go and when only 600 people showed up,\" Southwick said yesterday.  \"Sure our people are bored, looking for something to do, and some are bitching like hell.</span></p> <p><span>\"We went on the theory that for better or worse, the people who would camp in the Park would be our people and we felt an obligation to them.  We can't prevent a riot if, say.  Humphrey is nominated.  But we planned to do what we could for the people in the Park once they got here.\"</span></p> <p><span>Small but diverse groups ranging from the Yippies and Zippies to Hari Krishna to SDS are holed up at the Park.  Among them are several familiar Harvard activists, including Ira A. Helfand '72.  Cheyney D. Ryan '71, and Hillary Putnam, professor of Philosophy.</span></p> <p><span>Some of the McGovern youths housed at the Victor Hotel have packed and left figuring that once the campaign coordinators get their candidate nominated they will go back to work in the field.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's hard to slow down and do nothing after working so steadily for so long in the primaries.\"  Patrick L. Pankhurst ;71, one of Southwick's staff members, said Friday night while \"patrolling\" Flamingo Park.  At that point, many of the 100 demonstrators who had arrived were skinny-dipping in an adjacent swimming pool.</span></p> <p><span>\"I am really bored and in a way I feel useless just sitting around.\"  Pankhurst said.  Southwick, while aware of the tedium problem, explained it as \"a function of people not knowing how to relax.\"  \"Now that the Convention is underway, the tedium will diminish pretty rapidly,\" he said</span></p>"}
{"title": "Inside The Peoples' Republic | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N SPITE OF the televised hoo-ra-rah of Nixon's trip to China last February, and all the instant books on \"The New China\" which have proliferated in the aftermath, the need for reporting in-depth persists.  Most of the small number of reporters given the chance to enter the country with the Presidential mission were caught by the suddenness of the Chinese overtures of friendliness, went on little notice, and had little notion of the country's history and customs.  Once there, they discovered that some expertise was needed in order to treat the big stories; nationalism, the people's morale, the party's publically-stated ideology, the party powers' use of it.  As an uneasy compromise, they spent their time writing mood pieces and verifying for the folks back home that the Great Wall did truly exist.</span></p> <p><span>This was not the case for the Australian Ross Terrill.  He not only reports the major issues in his book <i>The 800,000,000,</i> but also provides political, cultural, and historical background necessary to evaluate the significance of the developments he reports.  Both a scholar and a journalist.  Terrill had been to China briefly in 1964:  last summer he was invited to return for forty days.  As a scholar and a writer, he had at least three angles from which to view his hosts.  First, there was history.  Because he was familiar with Chinese history, he could compare the circumstances of their present to the conditions of the past.  Second, he had the perspective of his other trip, in 1964.  Having been to China before the Cultural Revolution, he was able to make first-hand observations about the changes which took place during the seven years he was away.  Third, Terrill is a member of the Australian Labor Party.  Considered a friend by Peking, he was given more freedom to talk with officials and mingle with the people than most visitors are allowed.  Because he speaks Chinese, he made the most of his talks with officials (from Chi P'eng-fei, the Acting Foreign Minister, to Chou En-lai) and time in the streets.</span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>E IS best when combining his scholar's knowledge with his journalistic instincts in deciphering a real-life situation.  For instance, he makes us see the relationships between the behavior of his restaurant waiters, the toned-down political slogans on city walls, and the new Chinese hospitality for Henry Kissinger.  He shows us how the Red Guard and the Peking theatre reflect the Party line, and how the Foreign Ministry's willingness to talk about Taiwan demonstrate their new diplomatic flexibility.</span></p> <p><span>Like all the Western journalists who thrive on their freedom to come and go as they please Terrill blanches at the thought of living with the restrictions on personal liberties which in China are commonplace.  However, he stresses that the restrictions mean different things for the Chinese than for us.  For the Chinese, the control provides a reassuring social structure in which to work.  For the Westerner, it carries only negative connotations.  Throughout the book Terrill tries to give a sense of Chinese values and the Chinese view of the world.</span></p> <p><span><b>U</b>NFORTUNATELY, the merits of this book only point to the need for further work out of China.  For every question dealt with by Terrill, ten more come to mind.  For instance, in spite of Terrill's attempts to communicate the spirit in which the Chinese embrace their slogans, it remains a puzzling phenomenon (for us.)  Before we understand it, we shall have to know how the spirit of the rhetoric gets transmitted to the children.  And for those Chinese whose revolutionary enthusiasm flags, we want to know the spirit in which criticism of them is given and accepted.  Is this spirit culturally-cultivated, and thus relatively consistent in the population, or does it depend on the individual?  Do married men and women really live holding their political responsibilities above their family obligations?  How has the Chinese family structure been changed by the Party?  The number of questions it is possible to ask about China go on indefinitely.</span></p> <p><span>With his book Terrill has asked and answered a few; and raised and deferred a good many more.  As journalism of the moment.  <i>The 800,000,000</i> provides points of departure for any and all with an interest in China.  Incomplete as it is, it will have staying power as an introduction to further, more complete studies of the People's Republic.</span></p>"}

Let me make clear right from the start that I don't need the job.  Before I came here I was an important man on the National Security Council in the United States Government, I turned down the job of editor-in-chief of Harper's hoping I would get tenure at Harvard.  Now it seems I won't be able to stay.  Is there anything I can do? <b>CHARISMATIC</b></span></p> <p><span>Dear Charismatic,</span></p> <p><span>It's probably too late.  \"East Asian-American Relations\" is much too fuzzy, Make up your mind:  Do you want American or do you want East Asian?  If you want to stay at Harvard-- and neither government nor Harper's (why not the Atlantic, for heaven's sake?) is the place for a young gentleman--you should look for another job.  Have you ever thought of being a House Master?  Or, better--I'm told all these newspapermen come to Harvard each year as Nieman Fellows.  Surely they need someone to take care of them.</span></p> <p><span>Dear Miss Getachair,</span></p> <p><span>I am an instructor at a state university in the Midwest.  I want to be a Harvard professor.  What do you think I should do? \u00a0\u00a0<b>YOUNG AND DETERMINED</b></span></p> <p><span>Dear Y&amp;G,</span></p> <p><span>Join a women's auxiliary or a minority group.</span></p> <p><span>Dear Miss Getachair,</span></p> <p><span>I am rich, successful, and surrounded by important friends.  All Harvard offers is crummy pay, a heavy teaching load, and a community infested with underfed hippies and overdressed tourists.  So why am I beating my brains out to stay here? \u00a0\u00a0<b>BAFFLED</b></span></p> <p><span>Dear Baffled,</span></p> <p><span>Good question.  I'm baffled, too.</span></p> <p><span><b>G</b>OOD QUESTION, indeed.  Why do so many scholars enter the Harvard rat race and compete for that elusive bit of cheese, a tenured appointment?  Some cite their eminent colleagues, others the excellent library, the fine students, or the Boston location.</span></p> <p><span>All stress the importance of the Harvard name.  The prestige of Harvard does more than boost a man's ego; it usually boosts his career.  Researchers in the natural sciences find that Federal grants have a tendency to gravitate toward Cambridge.  And for social scientists, the ivied paths of Harvard often lead directly to Washington.</span></p> <p><span>But as the many state universities improve in quality, competitors to Harvard appear on the horizon.  Although their libraries and faculties do not equal Harvard's the salary and fringe benefit offers of these universities may lure individual members of the Harvard Faculty.  This still does not happen very often.  The Dunlop Report on the Recruitment and Retention of Faculty noted that in the decade from 1957-8 to 1966-7, only 24 tenured Faculty members left Harvard to accept academic positions elsewhere.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard Faculty members are not being drawn away.  But the Harvard magnetism has lost its attractive force for many academics at other universities.  Fifty years ago, perhaps, middle-aged professors sat around and waited for the call to Harvard.  These days, the call often goes unheard.  The 1968 Dunlop Report noted that in the previous decade, about half of Harvard's offers to professors at other universities were refused.  The report concluded that \"once a man is settled and reasonably successful, it is hard to move him either to or away from Harvard.\"</span></p> <p><span>If that is true, Harvard should be grooming its junior Faculty members for tenured positions.  Instead, Harvard is an export factory which supplies the nation's universities with many of their brightest young professors.  As its budding scholars fall off the vine, Harvard goes on looking for \"the best man available anywhere in the world\" to fill each opening.  That is why this year, for instance, the History Department failed to renew the contracts of three junior Faculty members and extended futile offers to distinguished European historians who replied that they like it where they are.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>Dear Miss Getachair,</span></p> <p><span>Why be modest?  I am a bright young historian of modern Europe.  For several years I have been working on a brilliant book which, alas, is still in manuscript.  Now my contract is up for renewal and my department informs me that it wants a book, not a manuscript.  The chairman keeps adumbrating something called the Graustein formula which, coupled with the implications of the Dunlop Report, means (or so he says) that there is no longer a place for me at Harvard.  Is he telling the truth?  What is this Graustein formula, and what does it want from me? \u00a0\u00a0<b>UNAPPRECIATED</b></span></p> <p><span>Dear Unappreciated,</span></p> <p><span>The Graustein formula is a rule.  Harvard has many rules.  When they don't want to give you something, they cite a rule.  When they want to give you something, they find a way to bypass the rule.  You wanted something that they didn't want to give you.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>AMED AFTER the Harvard mathematician who did the statistical work, the Graustein formula was given to Harvard by the influential Committee of Eight in 1938.  Professor Graustein estimated that the average tenured Faculty member stays at Harvard for 34 years.  He then computed the number of annual appointments each department must make to remain at its current size.  That figure--\"the Graustein number\"--more or less determines the frequency of appointments in each department.  For example, if a department had 17 tenured members in 1938, it would be entitled to appoint a new member every other year.</span></p> <p><span>Because new departments and new fields within departments have developed since 1938, and because life in general does not always conform to written rules, the Dean of the Faculty must, in his words, apply the Graustein formula \"flexibly.\"  If a department has a chance to pick up a hotshot professor, it can borrow ahead on its Graustein number and get him while he's available, even if the next scheduled appointment in the department is several months or years hence.  If a patron donates endowed chairs to a specific department, or if a particular field grows rapidly, the Dean has two options.  He can bring in new professors \"above the line,\" and change the department's Graustein number.  Or he can make \"below the line\" appointments, hiring a few extra people and post-poning the decision to replace them until the time of their retirement.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's a useful managerial tool,\" Dean Dunlop commented last week.  He said that the formula has three major advantages:  it works to prevent retiring professors from hand-picking their successors; it enables departments to adjust to changing fields of study; and, if handled properly, it creates an even age distribution in the Faculty.</span></p> <p><span>The Graustein number is also a good figure for a department chairman to have ready when a disappointed assistant professor asks why he was not rehired.  But this institutionalized mystification fools no one.  \"The Graustein is simply a clothesline to hang appointments on,\" quipped one assistant professor.</span></p> <p><span>One assistant professor of History whose appointment was hanged this year is Charles S. Maier '60.  Maier was appointed an instructor in Spring 1967.  In Fall 1969, after the enactment of the Dunlop Report's recommendation to phase out the position of instructor, Maier became an assistant professor.  Under the provisions of the changeover period, he opted for a four-year term.  His contract came up for renewal this year, one year before its fourth and final year, 1972-3.</span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>AIER HOPED to be promoted to the tenured rank of professor.  Because he had already taught for more than five years, he was not eligible for a three-year term appointment.  Before the Dunlop Report, the scholar shinnying up the Harvard Great Chain of Being served five years as an instructor and then, if his contract was renewed, another three years as an assistant professor.  A regulation of the American Association of University Professors requires universities to grant tenure to academics who have taught at the school for eight years.  So, after serving his initial eight years, the assistant professor in the pre-Dunlop era would, if promoted, receive tenure and the title of associate professor.</span></p> <p><span>Under the new, post-Dunlop system, a person begins as an assistant professor with a five-year contract.  After those five years are up, he is promoted (if he is lucky) to associate professor, which is now a non-tenured position.  When that three-year contract expires, he is ready to become a tenured full professor.</span></p> <p><span>When should an assistant professor be made an associate professor?  The Dunlop Report is deliberately vague on that point.  \"Appointments to this rank should be limited to those who merit serious consideration for promotion to tenure,\" the Dunlop Report recommended.  Elaborating on this point, Dunlop said last week, \"There are two requirements.  First, a person must be of a quality, given a further period of development, likely to show the kind of quality we are looking for in tenure appointments.  Second, there must be reasonable prospects of a permanency.\"</span></p> <p><span>Just what constitutes \"reasonable prospects of a permanency\"?  Dunlop would rather not say.  He maintains that a general definition cannot be codified.  \"I don't mind two or three people competing for a vacancy,\" he commented.  \"But I will not see the debasement of the associate professorship by having ten guys competing for one spot.\"</span></p> <p><span>As dean of the Faculty, Dunlop must approve the promotions that each department recommends.  This year, he cracked down on promotions and required department chairmen to justify each new appointment.  He identifies two reasons for this policy:  \"We are interested in getting the best possible people, in looking outside as well as inside; and we want the record clear with regard to equal employment opportunities.\"  He does not mention a third reason--the financial difficulties which demand stringency.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HATEVER HIS reasons, Dunlop last Fall vetoed the Government Department's recommendation to promote two assistant professors, Robert L. Jervis and James R. Kurth, to the rank of associate professor.  You can only promote one, Dunlop told Department chairman James Q. Wilson.  When Wilson then presented a Department recommendation to promote Jervis and let Kurth go, supporters of the more radical Kurth protested vehemently.  After a couple of months of bickering, Dunlop finally agreed to let the two promotions go through.</span></p> <p><span>Both Jervis and Kurth specialize in international relations.  Dunlop's original reluctance to promote two men and let them compete for one vacancy may stem from his recognition that in the field of international relations, only half a vacancy exists.  Presumably, both Kurth and Jervis are now vying for the spot that Henry A. Kissinger '50 once occupied.  But Kissinger is only half gone.  Although Dunlop says, \"As far as I'm concerned he has resigned.\"  the chairman of the Government Department says that Kissinger can return to his place if, sometime in November, he communicates his intention to leave the Nixon Administration by the end of the year.  The place that Kurth and Jervis are competing for may soon be no place at all.</span></p> <p><span>No matter what happens, Kurth and Jervis are relatively fortunate.  If they were in the History Department, they would probably be out looking for jobs.  The History Department has never appointed a non-tenured associate professor.  By interpreting the Dunlop report's guidelines so strictly, the Department in effect has cut a man's trial period down to four years.  Under the old system, an instructor who showed promise in his first couple of years would be rehired and would have five additional years to prove himself before his contract came up for review.  Today a man with a Ph.D. starts as an assistant professor.  He has four years before his appointment is reviewed.  If his department interprets the term \"promise\" broadly, he will have another three years to produce written work.  But if his department, like the History Department, thinks that to promote a man to associate professor is to promise him a tenured position, the assistant professor will have only four years to write a distinguished book.</span></p> <p><span>Most people can't do it.  When Charles Maier's contract came up for review last winter, his book was still in manuscript.  While that may have been a factor in his case, the tenure bid of his colleague, Samuel R. Williamson, was also shot down.  And Williamson had already written one prize-winning book and had another book in the works.</span></p> <p><span>The regulation that a man must have published a book of proven value is one of those rules that can be cited or waived, depending on the sentiments of the department.  For example, Edward L. Keenan '57, received tenure almost two years before his book on Ivan the Terrible was published.  Patrick L.R. Higonnet '58 who, like Keenan, became a professor in Spring, 1970, also had no published book at the time of his appointment.  So even in the History Department, a man can get tenure without having completed a book.  And while scholars in some other fields produce primarily articles, historians are normally judged by the merits of their books.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>Dear Miss Getachair,</span></p> <p><span>I am an assistant professor.  I have been offered the job of Senior Tutor.  Should I accept? \u00a0\u00a0<b>HESITANT</b></span></p> <p><span>Dear Hesitant,</span></p> <p><span>As Senior Tutor, you will receive a secretary, a telephone, a free house, a private office, and a sure shot at a tenured position...at any university but Harvard.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>fter all the administrative drudgery that Senior Tutors perform, they must find it disheartening to learn that the position hurts, rather than helps their chances for promotion in the Faculty.  Since the post was created in 1952, there have been 63 non-tenured Senior Tutors.  Six of them have become tenured professors at Harvard.  \"Most Senior Tutors do not make it at Harvard unless they're given tenure at the time of their appointment,\" observed Charles P. Whitlock, who as dean of the College acts as chairman of the Administrative Board of Senior Tutors.  \"But most Senior Tutors go on to be full professors at other colleges,\" he added.</span></p> <p><span>When asked if he thought the job of Senior Tutor of Kirkland House hurt his prospects for tenure, Sam Williamson said only, \"It didn't help.\"  Williamson served as Senior Tutor during the hectic days of radical political activity.  The chores of the position eat away research time.  They also prevent a man from building his departmental reputation and keep him from doing the requisite number of favors for his senior colleagues.</span></p> <p><span>Even if a man stretches his days to the bursting point, he will find his record as Senior Tutor a hindrance.  Departments do more than ignore a man's contribution as Senior Tutor; they often count it against him.  Academics apparently prefer scholars who are strictly scholars and not administrators, too.  The Senior Tutors who make good usually have House Masters slugging for them in their own department:  consider Mason Hammond and Ernest May in Kirkland House; John Bullitt and Joel Porte in Quincy House; and Eliot Perkins and Franklin Ford in Lowell House.</span></p> <p><span>Many conservative Faculty members felt especially hostile toward Senior Tutors during the late Sixties, when they thought the Administrative Board should have been punishing student radicals more severely.  These political considerations probably damaged the Harvard career of Cornelis Klein, associate professor of Mineralogy and former Senior Tutor of Leverett House.</span></p> <p><span>Klein had advanced higher on the ladder than Maier and Williamson.  In July, 1969, the Geology Department raised him to the non-tenured rank of associate professor.  In Spring, 1971, the Department recommended that he be promoted to full professor and be granted tenure.</span></p> <p><span>When a department wants to hire an assistant or associate professor, the Dean of the Faculty must approve the choice. WHEN A DEPARTment wants to give a man tenure, more elaborate approval is required.  An appointment without limit of time, which lasts an average of 34 years, is a more serious matter than a term appointment of three or five years.  The President of the University must approve each tenure appointment.  Ever since the Committee of Eight Report revised the system in 1938, the President has convened an ad hoc committee to advise him in his decision.</span></p> <p><span>After a department meets and recommends a candidate for tenure, the department chairman must submit to the Dean a list of scholars, outside as well as inside the University.  From that list, the Dean and President select an ad hoc committee to judge the proposed appointment.  This ad hoc committee then considers a pile of written material prepared and collected by the department chairman.  Such material includes letters from the chairman and other members of the department, opinions of scholars inside and outside the University, a biography and bibliography of the nominee, a description of the search procedure, and a discussion of why this candidate is the person best qualified for the job.  Meeting with the President, the ad hoc committee then interviews the department chairman and other experts.  Finally, the committee reports to the President, and the President decides.</span></p> <p><span>The ad hoc committee procedure is designed to help the President judge a candidate's qualifications and ensure that the department has checked outside the University in searching for the most eminent scholar available.  The system also helps watchdog the distribution of tenure appointments among the fields within a department.  Sometimes a department selects more than one name and asks the President and the ad hoc committee to choose the best person.  More often, it proposes one candidate and requests his confirmation.</span></p> <p><span>On May 25, 1971, one month before leaving office, President Pusey vetoed Klein's appointment.  Such a decision is always unusual.  In Klein's case, it was especially surprising, since his department unanimously had recommended his promotion.  Characteristically, Pusey's motives were a subtly blended mixture of academics and politics.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE ACADEMIC question went beyond Klein's personal qualifications.  In Fall, 1970, Dean Dunlop had created a committee to investigate the status of Geophysics in the Geology Department.  Francis Birch '24, the Department's only tenured geophysicist, by then had already passed the retirement age.  The small committee of scientists from outside and inside the University reported that Geophysics, the fastest growing and most glamorous area of Geology, was grossly understaffed at Harvard.  It noted the abundance of Harvard mineralogists and suggested boosting Geophysics at the expense of Mineralogy.  So one year after Klein became an associate professor of Mineralogy, with the assumption that his work met the University's standards and that \"reasonable prospects of a permanency\" existed, a special and prestigious committee was reporting to the President and Dean that Harvard needed more geophysicists and fewer mineralogists.</span></p> <p><span>The special committee's recommendations were no doubt important.  But senior members of the Department who testified before the ad hoc committee say that President Pusey himself played an extraordinarily energetic role.  \"He was clearly in command,\" one Geology professor recalled.  Pusey easily dominated the men he had asked to serve on the ad hoc committee.  One of these men had also sat on the special review committee.</span></p> <p><span>One geologist speculated that his fellow Department members described Klein's virtues less emphatically when questioned by a President who obviously opposed the appointment.  After one of Klein's backers reminded Pusey that Klein had conducted a good deal of research despite the time-consuming duties of the Senior Tutorship, the President reportedly snapped back, \"Franklin Ford was a Senior Tutor, and he did all right.\"</span></p> <p><span>Klein's performance as Senior Tutor hardly endeared him to Pusey.  No one objected more than the President to the Ad Board's lenient treatment of disruptive student radicals.  Pusey's distaste for Klein's politics probably provided the passion behind his academic objections to the appointment.</span></p> <p><span>\"The only thing that I find an unresolved problem is the non-reaction of the Department,\" Klein says in retrospect.  \"They had made two decisions:  a promotion to associate professor, which was a unanimous decision, and then a unanimous decision to recommend me to the ad hoc committee.  I find it odd that the Department in no way reacted.\"  Klein thinks that the chairman could have appealed the verdict to a new judge, President Bok, who took office a month later.</span></p> <p><span>If the Department had in fact not wanted to appoint Klein, it might very well have spared itself the unpleasantness of arguing his merits and simply sent his name to an ad hoc committee sure to shoot him down.  Neither Klein nor his senior colleagues contend that is what happened.  Such things have happened, however, in the History Department, which is notorious for its acrimonious debates and factional splits.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE HISTORY Department had its full share of unpleasantness in Fall, 1969, when it debated the appointment of Fritz Stern, a German history professor at Columbia.  David S. Landes, professor of History and Stern's good friend, supported the appointment enthusiastically.  Oscar Handlin, Warren Professor of American History, led the opposing forces.  As usual, the sides split roughly along the American and European divisional lines of the Department.</span></p> <p><span>The Department recommended by a split vote that Stern be hired.  The ad hoc committee was unimpressed, however, and President Pusey rejected the appointment.</span></p> <p><span>Stern's supporters were bitter.  They knew that Handlin had gone to the top to voice his objections.  They also suspected that Franklin L. Ford, McLean Professor of Ancient and Modern History and former dean of the Faculty, was less than enthusiastic about the prospect of a new man encroaching on his territory of modern German history.  They realized that if Ford had wanted the appointment, he was close enough to Pusey to guarantee its approval.</span></p> <p><span>Why was Stern blackballed?  In such cases, the academic and political reasons tend to blur together.  On the one hand, Stern writes slowly and reputedly mistreats graduate students.  On the other hand, his record in the Columbia strike was mushy left, which was anathema to conservatives like Handlin.</span></p> <p><span>The wounds were still red when Patrick Higonnet's bid for tenure came up in the Spring of that academic year.  Higonnet was a Continental historian who specialized in modern France and could also cover Austria-Hungary.  The Department was looking for someone to replace Crane Brinton, who had taught French history.  It also needed someone to do Austria.  Higonnet seemed to be the man.</span></p> <p><span>Higonnet had even more going for him.  His conservative politics pleased Handlin and the other Americanists.  His ignorance of Germany satisfied Ford.  The departmental chores he had performed softened up everybody.  And the coup de grace:  his father, a French inventor, had helped Stern's chief backer, David Landes, gain admittance to a number of important French archives.  Higonnet was in the right place at the right time.  The Department united behind him, and the President confirmed the appointment.</span></p> <p><span>Higonnet may have outclassed his competitor, Robert Darnton of Princeton, on purely academic considerations, although in fact Darnton had published more written work.  Whatever the case, the important point is that Higonnet did not have to battle with academic weapons alone.  Politics, both personal and partisan, enter into decisions to hire as well as decisions not to hire.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>Dear Miss Getachair,</span></p> <p><span>I am a great teacher, and my students love me.  Unfortunately I haven't published very much at all.  You see, I've been too busy drawing up new courses and meeting with students.  Do you think my department will understand?  What are my chances for tenure?\u00a0\u00a0<b>ANXIOUS</b></span></p> <p><span>Dear Anxious,</span></p> <p><span>No.  And nil.</span></p> <p><span><b>J</b>UST AS WE, like Dosteovsky, can imagine the modern Church crucifying Christ, so we can envision Harvard University terminating the contract of Socrates because he had produced no written work.  Although all the written rules stipulate that \"creative work,\" and not printed pages, determine a candidate's eligibility for tenure, in practice the dictum of \"publish or perish\" retains its force.</span></p> <p><span>Scholarly work, and not teaching ability, decides the fate of the academic at Harvard.  Defending the system, Dean Dunlop argues that the University must be able to predict a man's future.  A professor's teaching ability can fluctuate sharply over the next thirty years, Dunlop maintains, but his capacity to produce creative written work will remain relatively constant.  Ignoring the truth value of this dubious statement, we can still safely conclude that at Harvard, teaching comes second to research.</span></p> <p><span>James C. Thomson Jr., Lecturer in History and one of the three young historians who did not receive tenure this year, expressed the view of most junior faculty when he said.  \"The system is so constructed in theory and practice as to provide good teaching only by accident.  On the one hand, those hired for permanency are not hired with an eye to their teaching ability.  On the other hand, those who are junior faculty teach under conditions of such stress, overwork and career anxiety, knowing the odds are 99 to 1 that they won't be kept here, that they put their energy into getting their theses and other publications into print to get themselves jobs elsewhere.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although the charismatic Thomson did not receive tenure, he will stay at Harvard as curator of the Nieman Fellows program.  Like most administrative posts, the appointment of curator is \"without limit of time.\"  The appointment extends indefinitely but can be terminated any time at the pleasure of the President.  Such an appointment lacks the security of a tenured position.  As one Faculty member observed wryly.  \"To get thrown out, a tenured professor really has to rape little girls.  Lots of them.  One wouldn't be enough.\"  Presumably, for an administrator, one would be enough.</span></p> <p><span>Thomson will continue to teach courses as a Lecturer in History.  His tenure appointment, like many others in the History Department, collapsed because it was spread too thin over different areas.  Thomson specializes in East Asian-American relations.  This field is just gaining scholarly recognition, but to the academically conservative Harvard History Department, it is still unestablished.  The East Asian wing of the Department supported Thomson's candidacy, but the Americanists opposed it.  The Americanists won, and Thomson lost.  In a similar episode, Ernest R.  May, an American historian, backed the bid of Sam Williamson, a specialist in European diplomatic history.  Caught between the two opposing camps of Americanists and Europeanists, Williamson was neither fish nor fowl.  The Department would not recommend his promotion.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>NE WAY TO open a new field in a stuffy department is to raise money for an endowed chair.  John K. Fairbank '29, Higginson Professor of History, is directing a fund drive for a chair in Vietnamese Studies, which will presumably be occupied by his protege, Alexander B. Woodside, assistant professor of History.  The going price for an endowed chair is $1 million.  The income on that sum is primarily used for salaries, which average $24,000 and do not exceed $33,000.  Because Fairbank began the drive in 1967, when the cost of a chair was only $600,000, the University has set that amount as the target.  The Ford Foundation donated half, and Fairbank has already raised another $150,000.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's rather difficult to drop a field,\" Fairbank said.  \"You come along with a new field and you have to raise money for it.  A field once established usually doesn't disappear.\"  A field did disappear when Fairbank was promoted to a place in Chinese history over 25 years ago.  The history of the Spanish Empire has not been taught at Harvard since.</span></p> <p><span>But Fairbank is the exception to the rule.  If Woodside receives tenure at Harvard, he will have Fairbank to thank for it.  In 1960, Fairbank came to Woodside with an idea.</span></p> <p><span>\"I suddenly realized in 1960 that Vietnam is a subject that isn't studied,\" Fairbank recalled.  \"That was a real giveaway.  What was I doing around here?  We were so occupied with China that we never thought about Vietnam.  It was French, and no one ever went there.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Luckily, an able man came along,\" he continued.  \"Woodside was at Harvard as a graduate student in Chinese history.  I asked him if he was interested, and he said he was.\"  Last year, Woodside published a book on the Chinese influence in Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>Some men do very well when they switch fields.  John Womack Jr. '59, professor of History, moved from American to Latin American history when he was a junior faculty member.  Now he has a brilliant reputation and a tenured position at Harvard that the History Department had wanted to fill for 14 years.  But not everyone is so successful.  Thomas E. Skidmore made a giant leap from medieval European history to Brazilian and South American history.  He is now at the University of Wisconsin.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>Dear Miss Getachair,</span></p> <p><span>Could I be dreaming?  Just yesterday my Department voted against giving me tenure.  Today I talked to ten senior faculty members and not one brought it up.  Am I hallucinating?  Did it all really happen?\u00a0\u00a0<b>SCHIZO</b></span></p> <p><span>Dear Schizo,</span></p> <p><span>You sound quite sane, but forgetful.  Remember:  you're no longer living in the real world.  Now you are at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>F SHE CAME to Harvard, Lewis Carroll's Alice would feel right at home.  The world of University manners becomes most surreal after a junior faculty member is not rehired.  None of his colleagues mention it.  \"It's perfectly absurd,\" Klein laughed.  \"You've taught joint courses with these people, you've known them outside.  Nothing is said.  Not even, 'Gosh, that's too bad.'  It's very strange.\"  Thomson also marvelled at \"the degree to which these things aren't spoken about,\" adding, \"No one says, 'I'm sorry things didn't work out.\"</span></p> <p><span>No one says a thing.  The system keeps on plugging along:  the frills change, but the premises remain the same.  Occasionally, the bulky machinery causes hilarious blunders.  Consider the episode of the secretary in the Department of Romance Languages, who accidentally mailed a letter inviting the wrong professor to come with tenure to Harvard.  He accepted and he came.  There was nothing the Department could do.</span></p> <p><span>But such gross mistakes are the exception.  The system normally runs quite smoothly.  It doesn't encourage good teaching, but it does let some good teachers through.  It loses many bright young scholars, but it manages to hang on to a few.  Lately, under pressure from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Harvard has increased its hiring of blacks and women.  These days, if a clever department chairman wants to hire additional non-tenured faculty, he just looks around for an eligible woman or black.  The President and Dean also ask department chairmen to submit a list of blacks and women who were considered for each tenure appointment.  Dean Dunlop may be cutting financial corners, but not at the expense of the University's affirmative action plan.</span></p> <p><span>It would be naive to expect promotions to proceed on purely objective, academic criteria.  What is alarming about the present system is not the latitude it permits for personal considerations.  Rather, it is the system's premises.  The University should be a place for teaching as well as for research.  When a department or ad hoc committee is considering a man's record, his teaching ability is not the primary concern.  Because departments at Harvard initiate appointments, the criteria for selection tend to be especially technical and book-oriented.  At smaller colleges, the president usually directs the entire procedure and pays more attention to a candidate's teaching ability.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard must find ways to develop and keep bright young scholars, or else it will lose the best men to the universities catching up from behind.  While it is all well and good to disdain the superstar salaries and featherweight teaching loads that some universities give to distinguished professors, it would be unrealistic to think that Harvard can trade on its name alone for much longer.  Once eminent men have settled down somewhere, it is very difficult to lure them away.  Either you develop your own young scholars or you dangle out tempting bribes to attract big names from outside.  Harvard must choose its course, unless it wishes to languish like an ancient battleship, a glorious but non-functional reminder of another era</span></p>"}
{"title": "Political Activity Revives As Vietnam War Expands | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>L</b>IKE THEIR COHORTS ACROSS the country, Harvard students were gradually lulled to sleep over the past two years by President Nixon's Vietnamization policy.  As American casualties dropped and war news left page one in national newspapers, Harvard and Radcliffe returned to the apolitical days of the pre-1967 era.</span></p> <p><span>Although a hard core of activists still criticized the continuing death and destruction in Vietnam, Nixon's cosmetic overhaul of the killing process placated dissent and the outrage felt by most students as recently as the May 1970 Cambodia invasion quietly slipped into history.  Even the Harvard chapter of SDS, long noted for its opposition to the war, turned inward with its anti-Herrnstein campaign.  A November 6 antiwar march drew only 5000 people from the entire Boston area:  Harvard students guzzled beer at the Princeton game played on the same day.</span></p> <p><span>But with the beginning of the North Vietnamese offensive on March 30 and Nixon's frantic attempts to halt the rapid erosion of South Vietnamese strength, students around the country were jolted out of their slumber.  As Nixon first escalated the bombing of the North and then mined Northern ports, students answered his affront to the people of the world by calling student strikes, engaging in mass acts of civil disobedience and lobbying their representatives in Washington.  A few of the more militant violently assaulted buildings they claimed were linked to the military effort.  University officials joined students in protesting the escalation:  many flew to Washington to confer with Administration officials and a few even risked arrest at antiwar actions.</span></p> <p><span>Antiwar protests at Harvard mirrored others throughout the country.  A mass meeting of 2200 students voted overwhelmingly to strike against the war, and many of them joined other area college students in a series of acts of civil disobedience at targets in Boston.  President Bok and the other Ivy League presidents expressed their concern at a private conference with Presidential advisor Henry A. Kissinger '50 at the same time as about 150 other Harvard students were in the nation's capital lobbying for antiwar measures.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard was not free from violence, however:  a Boston antiwar march unexpectedly veered onto the Harvard campus and, in a senseless three-minute rampage, 150 marchers devastated the interior of the Center for International Affairs (CFIA), causing about $25,000 in damage.  The marchers charged that the CFIA engages in counter-insurgency research for the American military.  Almost no Harvard students were involved in the action, and the community almost unanimously deplored the incident.</span></p> <p><span>Local actions peaked again following the President's decision to mine North Vietnamese harbors, but after a feared nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union failed to materialize, these actions rapidly subsided.  Already weeks behind in their school-work.  Harvard students returned to classrooms and libraries, thankful that a holocaust had not enveloped the world but still despairing because the air and naval onslaught on North Vietnam continued unabated.</span></p> <p><span>The protest had escalated quickly.  As students returned from Spring vacations, many applauded the North Vietnamese advances, hopeful that the Thieu regime in the South would be quickly deposed.  But after the Nixon Administration escalated the air war over the North, hitting Hanoi and Haiphong with giant B-52s for the first time in the war, domestic resistance rapidly stiffened.  A coalition of liberal and radical students embracing a variety of campus political organizations met and called a mass meeting for April 20.  <i>The Crimson</i> joined 15 other college newspapers across the country in running concurrently an editorial calling for a student strike against the war.  Campus outrage against the latest escalation mounted as a plethora of committees was formed and House meetings called.  The campus was swamped with posters and leaflets calling on students to respond to the President's arrogance; in addition, the controversy over Harvard's ownership of Gulf Oil stock was peaking, and the black students' protest fueled the growing activist mood.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>MID THIS ATMOSPHERE of anticipation, the People's Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ), a Cambridge-based antiwar collective, called an April 19 antiwar march slated to shut down a military recruiting office in downtown Boston.  After several hundred demonstrators risked arrest for about one-half hour by sitting in front of the Tremont St. office, a PCPJ spokesman unexpectedly announced that the march would proceed to a \"military-linked target\" somewhere in the Cambridge area.  The target's identity (it was the CFIA) and what would occur once the marchers reached it were kept secret, the spokesman explained, so that the police would not be able to abort the action.</span></p> <p><span>As the 1000 marchers wound through Boston, speculation rose that the target was Harvard Square because the route followed was the same as taken by an April 15, 1970 march that ended in street-fighting in the Square.  As the marchers passed several targets in the Central Square area and continued west on Mass Ave, a Harvard target seemed even more probable.  But the CFIA building was considered unlikely because a city-wide planning meeting several days earlier had ruled out University targets.</span></p> <p><span>When the march veered right abruptly on Quincy St., it became apparent that the target was indeed going to be the CFIA, located at 6 Divinity Ave.  The march's vanguard raced the last several hundred yards to the building, where about 20 people immediately shattered the windows of the three-story structure with rocks.  Several others attempted to open the doors.  The building's night watchman, alerted by a youth, had attempted to bar the door.</span></p> <p><span>Several minutes later, a group of marches rammed through the bar door using poles from antiwar banners, and a mob of about 150 people poured into the building as two Harvard policemen watched helplessly.  Once inside, the demonstrators began overturning bookcases, smashing windows and throwing books and papers about.  Some of the crowd refrained from the destruction, which was mostly spontaneous.  The vast majority were not Harvard students.</span></p> <p><span>Rumors that police had arrived filtered into the building, and the crowd fled.  They left water gushing from an open pipe, and a small paper fire burned on the second floor.  As the marchers filed out the rear entrance, a Harvard police car glided into the parking lot behind the building.  Two policemen leaped out and chased the group across Divinity Ave., where they rejoined 1200 other marchers and onlookers who had not entered the building.</span></p> <p><span>The march leadership, which had long since passed out of PCPJ hands, then cried \"on to IBM,\" and part of the crowd surged toward the IBM building on Cambridge St. Arriving several minutes later, they hurled rocks at the windows and prepared to enter the building for more trashing.  Their plans were interrupted, however, when a Cambridge police car screamed west on Cambridge St. and its driver jumped out and fired two shots into the air with his service revolver.</span></p> <p><span>At this, the crowd quickly scattered, although elements of it regrouped farther west and began marching down Quincy St. toward Harvard Square, declaring that their intention was to \"trash Harvard Trust and other banks.\"  But just as they reached Mass Ave, several Cambridge police cars and a bus filled with over 50 riot-equipped police pulled into the intersection and the 200 marchers were split in half.</span></p> <p><span>The police then skirmished for several hours with what remained of the original march, although most of the CFIA trashers had scattered.  Lines of police swept through the Square and adjoining side streets, reading an emergency curfew order signed by the Cambridge city manager and ordering everyone to disperse.  The police used tear gas four times and made two arrests.  Within two hours, the area had returned to relative normalcy and traffic was moving again.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE CFIA TRASHING was condemned almost unanimously by the community.  President Bok said it was an action with \"no purpose to be gained other than mindless violence.\"  <i>The Crimson</i> editorially condemned the attack \"without qualification\" and characterized it as \"aimless violence.\"  Daniel Steiner '54, general counsel to the University, estimated that about $25,000 damage had been done to the building.  Student volunteers and Harvard policemen worked late into the night to clear up the wreckage.  The trashing probably had a salutary effect on attendance at the upcoming mass meeting:  students became even more determined to translate their outrage into effective antiwar actions rather than dissipate it in senseless acts of violence.</span></p> <p><span>The 2200 students at the mass meeting convened on April 20 in an atmosphere of crisis.  Mass Hall had been occupied that morning by black students protesting Harvard's investment in Gulf Oil, which gave the assembly a special sense of urgency.  The meeting was held simultaneously in Sanders Theatre and Lowell Lec:  the two halls were connected by a functioning speaker system.</span></p> <p><span>The meeting voted to strike for five days to protest the Indochina War and to support the Mass Hall takeover.  A variety of resolutions passed urging students to participate in local antiwar actions, work for antiwar candidates in then upcoming Massachusetts Presidential primary, and support the black students by joining the picket line circulating in front of Mass Hall.  It also created a central coordinating committee to direct strike actions.</span></p> <p><span>The meeting adjourned without considering whether to picket classrooms or to demand a release from exam or class obligations.  This was largely in remembrance of the fiasco that followed the 1970 strike when students dissipated their energies by trying to persuade classmates not to attend class instead of engaging in constructive antiwar activities.</span></p> <p><span>About 75 per cent of the University's undergraduates boycotted classes the next day and many swelled the ranks of the 8000 people who participated in a march from the Boston Common to Post Office Square.  The next day, Saturday, April 22, many thronged to New York to join 40,000 protesters who clogged the streets there in the largest national antiwar demonstration in almost a year.  Others remained behind to man the picket line in front of Mass Hall.  Still others were out in the hustings for antiwar primary candidates Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.) or Rep. Shirley Chisholm (D-N.Y.).</span></p> <p><span>After the weekend, the euphoria passed and increasing numbers of students returned to class.  A two-hour sit-in Monday at the Cambridge draft board drew only 100 persons and the novelty of the Mass Hall occupation wore off.  The denouement hit rock bottom at the Tuesday night mass meeting, which had been slated by the first gathering to \"discuss the response of both the Harvard Administration and the U.S. to the current crisis.\"</span></p> <p><span>The second meeting, which was attended by only 650 people and embodied confusion, contrasted markedly with the fist.  The meeting voted first not to continue the strike and then, one hour later after 100 people had trickled out, reversed itself and voted to continue striking indefinitely.  The feverish activity of the past week had clearly taken its toll:  arguments and counter-arguments were made lackadaisically and motions to adjourn were repeatedly introduced by a tired and bored audience.  McGovern's convincing victory in the Massachusetts primary that day had injected a feeble note of optimism in the proceedings, but it was still clear that the activist mood was departing as quickly as it had come.  And when the black students filed out of Mass Hall two days later, the return to term-papers and lab assignments was virtually complete.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b> MAY 4 NATIONAL moratorium came and went almost unnoticed, and only a handful of Harvard's diehards turned out for a May 8 civil disobedience action at the John F. Kennedy Federal building in Boston at which 200 persons were arrested.  But that night, President Nixon escalated the war against the North another notch, and antiwar sentiments were rekindled anew.  His television announcement that he would mine the North Vietnamese ports prompted renewed plans for action, as Harvard students again prepared to disrupt their routines to stop what appeared briefly to be a mad march to the nuclear brink.</span></p> <p><span>On May 11, 40 protesters broke into and occupied three Government Department offices in Littauer Center to demand that Harvard revoke its invitation to Presidential aide Henry A. Kissinger '50 to return to his chair in the Government Department.  They left after several hours.  One hundred and eighty-five people were arrested May 11 in front of a Boston military recruiting office after a civil disobedience action:  many of them this time were Harvard students.  And the trashers were at it again later the same day when a group of about 500 people marched from Boston and, after eluding Cambridge police, sabotaged a stretch of railroad tracks near MIT and battled police for several hours in the heaviest tear-gasing of the Spring.  Taking a different tack, 150 students left for Washington May 13 to attempt to pressure certain swing Congressmen to support legislation to end the war.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard faculty and Administrators also joined in antiwar actions as a group of 300 Boston-area professors held their own march to the JFK Building.  \"I once told Dr. Martin Luther King that I could do anything but march,\" John Kenneth Galbraith, Warburg Professor of Economics and one of the march organizers, explained.  \"It really has not been my style, but Nixon's reckless action warrants a stronger reaction.\"  Laurence Wylie, Dillon Professor of the Civilization of France, was also marching for the first time.  \"We are distressed, cynical and just a little beaten by the continuing Vietnam issue,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>President Bok also added his voice to the antiwar chorus.  He flew to Washington with the seven other Ivy League presidents and the president of Stanford and spent May 17 conferring with House members and lobbying against the war.  \"We are trying to stress that students care very much about the human suffering that results from the war,\" Bok said.  The nine presidents capped the day's activities by conferring privately with Kissinger, a meeting arranged at Bok's request.  After the meeting, they would only say that it had been characterized by much \"frank talk\" in the exchange of views.</span></p> <p><span>But as the lobbyists left Washington and the ICBM's remained in their silos, protest again subsided.  As Nixon flew off to Moscow to consummate some nefarious deal with the Soviets, the fear students felt about nuclear confrontation following his speech turned to chagrin.  The bombing of the North continued unabated, but the sense of urgency it had initially prompted swiftly dissipated as students again re-entered Lamont and Widener for a few feverish days before exams.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE SPRING'S NADIR came at the May 22 march on the Pentagon.  Called by an emergency coalition of major national antiwar groups immediately after the mines were sown, the action was seen as an attempt to duplicate the now-legendary 1967 march on the mammoth military headquarters.  Even in the days immediately preceding the action, its organizers expected to attract between 3000 and 5000 people.  But as the President flew off to Moscow, the action lost much of its relevance.  Only about 1000 people showed up as the march timetables went awry and its leadership quarreled divisively.  After sparring for several hours with riot-equipped police in front of the building, the marchers surged toward the police lines and 200 were carted away.  The action was viewed as a failure by almost everyone involved.</span></p> <p><span>The Spring's actions left most students with a feeling of enraged impotence.  It seemed as if no kind of protest, violent or otherwise, could penetrate the impregnable barriers with which President Nixon and his tiny coterie of advisors have surrounded themselves.  A government unresponsive to or even unaware of the wishes of its people seemed to have become the norm in American life.  Thousands of students, here and across the country, relearned the hard political facts of life this Spring.  As Hanoi was evacuated and American bombers continued to level North Vietnam and much of the rest of Southeast Asia, those students became even more convinced that fundamental social change is an imperative facing America if the rest of the world is to survive.</span></p>"}

Of all the issues of the last year, the Indochina War remains the most persistent, the most cruel, the most shameful.  Four years ago, few would have predicted that the war which forced Lyndon Johnson into retirement would be prosecuted on ever-higher levels of mechanized slaughter in the spring of 1972.  But Nixon's \"peace\" plans are only aimed at American voters.  In Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, his plans call for victory over all efforts for independence.  And in Paris all he offers is an ultimatum for the capitulation of those who fight against the totalitarian Thieu regime.</span></p> <p><span>Today's Commencement protest against American war policy in Asia shouldn't be necessary.

The building's night watchman, alerted by a youth, had attempted to bar the door.</span></p> <p><span>Several minutes later, a group of marchers rammed through the bar door using poles from antiwar banners, and a mob of about 150 people poured into the building as two Harvard policemen watched helplessly.  Once inside, the demonstrators began overturning bookcases, smashing windows and throwing books and papers about.  Some of the crowd refrained from the destruction, which was mostly spontaneous.  The vast majority were not Harvard students.</span></p> <p><span>Rumors that police had arrived filtered into the building, and the crowd fled.  They left water gushing from an open pipe, and a small paper fire burned on the second floor.  As the marchers filed out the rear entrance, a Harvard police car glided into the parking lot behind the building.  Two policemen leaped out and chased the group across Divinity Ave., where they rejoined 1200 other marchers and onlookers who had not entered the building.</span></p> <p><span>The march leadership, which had long since passed out of PCPJ hands, then cried \"on to IBM,\" and part of the crowd surged toward the IBM building on Cambridge St.  Arriving several minutes later, they hurled rocks at the windows and prepared to enter the building for more trashing.  Their plans were interrupted, however, when a Cambridge police car screamed west on Cambridge St. and its driver jumped out and fired two shots into the air with his service revolver.</span></p> <p><span>At this, the crowd quickly scattered, although elements of it regrouped farther west and began marching down Quincy St. toward Harvard Square, declaring that their intention was to \"trash Harvard Trust and other banks.\"  But just as they reached Mass Ave. several Cambridge police cars and a bus filled with over 50 riot-equipped police pulled into the intersection and the 200 marchers were split in half.</span></p> <p><span>The police then skirmished for several hours with what remained of the original march, although most of the CFIA trashers had scattered.  Lines of police swept through the Square and adjoining side streets, reading an emergency curfew order signed by the Cambridge city manager and ordering everyone to disperse.  The police used tear gas four times and made two arrests.  Within two hours, the area had returned to relative normalcy and traffic was moving again.</span></p> <p><span><b>THE CFIA TRASHING</b> was condemned almost unanimously by the community.  President Bok said it was an action with \"no purpose to be gained other than mindless violence.\"  <i>The Crimson</i> editorially condemned the attack \"without qualification\" and characterized it as \"aimless violence.\"  Daniel Steiner '54, general counsel to the University, estimated that about $25,000 damage had been done to the building.  Student volunteers and Harvard policemen worked late into the night to clear up the wreckage.  The trashing probably had a salutary effect on attendance at the upcoming mass meeting; students became even more determined to translate their outrage into effective antiwar actions rather than dissipate it in senseless acts of violence.</span></p> <p><span>The 2200 students at the mass meeting convened on April 20 in an atmosphere of crisis.  Mass Hall had been occupied that morning by black students protesting Harvard's investment in Gulf Oil, which gave the assembly a special sense of urgency.  The meeting was held simultaneously in Sanders Theatre and Lowell Lec:  the two halls were connected by a functioning speaker system.</span></p> <p><span>The meeting voted to strike for five days to protest the Indochina War and to support the Mass Hall takeover.  A variety of resolutions passed urging students to participate in local antiwar actions, work for antiwar candidates in the then upcoming Massachusetts Presidential primary, and support the black students by joining the picket line circulating in front of Mass Hall.  It also created a central coordinating committee to direct strike actions.</span></p> <p><span>The meeting adjourned without considering whether to picket classrooms or to demand a release from exam or class obligations.  This was largely in remembrance of the fiasco that followed the 1970 strike when students dissipated their energies by trying to persuade classmates not to attend class instead of engaging in constructive antiwar activities.</span></p> <p><span>About 75 per cent of the University's undergraduates boycotted classes the next day and many swelled the ranks of the 8000 people who participated in a march from the Boston Common to Post Office Square.  The next day, Saturday, April 22, many thronged to New York to join 40,000 protesters who clogged the streets there in the largest national antiwar demonstration in almost a year.  Others remained behind to man the picket line in front to Mass Hall.  Still others were out in the hustings for antiwar primary candidates Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.) or Rep. Shirley Chisholm (D-N.Y.).</span></p> <p><span>After the weekend, the euphoria passes and increasing numbers of students returned to class.  A two-hour sit-in Monday at the Cambridge draft board drew only 100 persons and the novelty of the Mass Hall occupation wore off.  The denouement hit rock bottom at the Tuesday night mass meeting, which had been slated by the first gathering to \"discuss the response of both the Harvard Administration and the U.S. to the current crisis.\"</span></p> <p><span>The second meeting, which was attended by only 650 people and embodied confusion, contrasted markedly with the first.  The meeting voted first not to continue the strike and then, one hour later after 100 people had trickled out, reversed itself and voted to continue striking indefinitely.  The feverish activity of the past week had clearly taken its toll:  arguments and counter-arguments were made lackadaisically and motions to adjourn were repeatedly introduced by a tired and bored audience.  McGovern's convincing victory in the Massachusetts primary that day had injected a feeble note of optimism in the proceedings, but it was still clear that the activist mood was departing as quickly as it had come.  And when the black students filed out of Mass Hall two days later, the return to term-papers and lab assignments was virtually complete.</span></p> <p><span><b>A MAY 4 NATIONAL</b> moratorium came and went almost unnoticed, and only a handful of Harvard's diehards turned out for a May 8 civil disobedience action at the John F. Kennedy Federal building in Boston at which 200 persons were arrested.  But that night, President Nixon escalated the war against the North another notch, and antiwar sentiments were rekindled anew.  His television announcement that he would mine the North Vietnamese ports prompted renewed plans for action, as Harvard students again prepared to disrupt their routines to stop what appeared briefly to be a mad march to the nuclear brink.</span></p> <p><span>On May 11, 40 protesters broke into and occupied three Government Center to demand that Harvard revoke its invitation to Presidential aide Henry A. Kissinger '50 to return to his chair in the Government Department.  They left after several hours.  One hundred and eighty-five people were arrested May 11 in front of a Boston military recruiting office after a civil disobedience action:  many of them this time were Harvard students.  And the trashers were at it again later the same day when a group of about 500 people marched from Boston and, after eluding Cambridge police, sabotaged a stretch of railroad tracks near MIT and battled police for several hours in the heaviest tear-gasing of the Spring.  Taking a different tack, 150 students left for Washington May 13 to attempt to pressure certain swing Congressmen to support legislation to end the war.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard faculty and Administrators also joined in antiwar actions as a group of 300 Boston-area professors held their own march to the JFK Building.  \"I once told Dr. Martin Luther King that I could do anything but march,\" John Kenneth Galbraith.  Warburg Professor of Economics and one of the march organizers, explained.  \"It really has not been my style, but Nixon's reckless action warrants a stronger reaction.\"  Laurence Wylie, Dillon Professor of the Civilization of France, was also marching for the first time.  \"We are distressed, cynical and just a little beaten by the continuing Vietnam issue,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>President Bok also added his voice to the antiwar chorus.  He flew to Washington with the seven other Ivy League presidents and the president of Stanford and spent May 17 conferring with House members and lobbying against the war.  \"We are trying to stress that students care very much about the human suffering that results from the war,\" Bok said.  The nine presidents capped the day's activities by conferring privately with Kissinger, a meeting arranged at Bok's request.  After the meeting, they would only say that it had been characterized by much \"frank talk\" in the exchange of views.</span></p> <p><span>But as the lobbyists left Washington and the ICBM's remained in their silos, protest again subsided.  As Nixon flew off to Moscow to consummate some nefarious deal with the Soviets, the fear students felt about nuclear confrontation following his speech turned to chagrin.  The bombing of the North continued unabated, but the sense of urgency it had initially prompted swiftly dissipated as students again re-entered Lamont and Widener for a few feverish days before exams.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE SPRING'S NADIR came at the May 22 march on the Pentagon.  Called by an emergency coalition of major national antiwar groups immediately after the mines were sown, the action was seen as an attempt to duplicate the now-legendary 1967 march on the mammoth military headquarters.  Even in the days immediately preceding the action, its organizers expected to attract between 3000 and 5000 people.  But as the President flew off to Moscow, the action lost much of its relevance.  Only about 1000 people showed up as the march timetables quarreled divisively.  After sparing for several hours with riot-equipped police in front of the building, the marchers surged toward the police lines and 200 were carted away.  The action was viewed as a failure by almost everyone involved.</span></p> <p><span>The Spring's actions left most students with a feeling of enraged impotence.  It seemed as if no kind of protest, violent or otherwise, could penetrate the impregnable barriers with which President Nixon and his tiny coterie of advisors have surrounded themselves.  A government unresponsive to or even unaware of the wishes of its people seemed to have become the norm in American life.  Thousands of students, here and across the country, relearned the hard political facts of life this Spring.  As Hanoi was evacuated and American bombers continued to level North Vietnam and much of the rest of Southeast Asia, those students became even more convinced that fundamental social change is an imperative facing America if the rest of the world is to survive.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Throttling the News | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE SUPREME COURT'S refusal last week to exempt newsmen from divulging their sources before Federal grand juries strikes directly at the right of the American people to be informed by an unfettered press.  In a decision based on the promise that a newsman, like any other citizen, must cooperate with a grand jury even though the jury may ask him to violate the confidence of persons who supply him information, the Court ignores the imperatives of investigative reporting.  And it is largely through investigative reporting that the press serves the cause of justice and fulfills its role as the conscience of government.</span></p> <p><span>By declining to expand First Amendment rights to safeguard a reporter's confidentiality, the Court has endangered the ability of newsmen to gather information about illicit activities.  The Court's majority opinion holds that newsmen enjoy no special privilege before a grand jury; it maintains that newsmen have recourse through the courts to challenge a jury's interrogation if they feel it is peripheral to the case under investigation.  Further, the Court says that by requiring newsmen to divulge sources, given this legal recourse, it is imposing no prior restraint nor any other shackle forbidden by the Constitution.  Yet the practical effect of the Court's decision is that no mobster, no political dissident, no corrupt Congressman, nor any other person involved in illegal activities, will (provided he has any sense) discuss those activities with the press.  The knowledge that anything said to a reporter is subject to grand jury scrutiny effectively restricts the ability of the press to expose, investigate and analyze.  Indeed, the Supreme Court's decision must come as welcome relief to shysters who know the chances are 50-50 they can buy off the police, but who become queasy under the curious eye of a self-righteous, snooping reporter.</span></p> <p><span>Think only of the last year.  Neil Sheehan of The New York Times would be required to say who passed him the Pentagon Papers.  The same for columnist Jack Anderson and his ITT scoop.  Or more recently, The Times would be compelled to name before a grand jury every source--many of whom would be incriminated--for its series detailing graft in the New York City construction business totalling over $25 million annually.  The City of New York either could not, or did not bother to, uncover the scandal.  The Times did.  But had those men who supplied The Times its information known they would have no protection before a grand jury should The Times's reporter be called to testify, they never would have spoken up.  The story never would have been written.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>ERTAINLY members of the press do not constitute any elite class which should be granted special privileges before the Constitution.  But the function of a free press, as outlined in the Constitution, demands that the privilege of confidentiality be bestowed upon the press and its functionaries, reporters.  It is a right of profession:  just as, in most states, a priest does not have to breach the contract of confession, and a lawyer is protected in discussions with a client accused of a felony, so should a reporter be able to use the guarantee of confidentiality to flush out information which hastens the pursuit of justice.</span></p> <p><span>It is ironic that the Court's decision also precludes the possibility of investigative reporting which names names and pinpoints crimes.  Such reports have often led to prosecution.  The notion expressed by Mr. Justic Stewart in a dissenting opinion that the Court's decision \"invites state and Federal authorities to undermine the historic independence of the press by attempting to annex the journalistic profession as an investigative arm of government\" is well taken.  Unfortunately, the Court's decision creates an atmosphere in which the likelihood of a reporter being able to obtain information which could weigh on an investigation is slim indeed.</span></p> <p><span>In another dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice Douglas said:</span></p> <p><span>\"The inclusion of government into this domain is symptomatic of the disease of this society.  As the years pass the power of government becomes more and more pervasive.  It is a power to suffocate both people and causes.</span></p> <p><span>\"Those in power, whatever their politics, want only to perpetuate it.  Now that the fences of the law and the tradition that has protected the press are broken down, the people are the victims.  The First Amendment, as I read it, was designed to prevent that tragedy.\"</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, the decision speaks for itself:  it and another limiting Congressional immunity in the case of Sen. Mike Gravel (D-Ala.) and his release of the Pentagon Papers, intone a tragic shift of the Supreme Court to a Nixonesque majority.  The days of the Warren Court, of sweeping judicial reform, of the highest regard for civil liberty and human dignity, are passing us by as President Nixon assures a conservative majority.  Even the Court's decision outlawing the death penalty--based largely on its inconsistent application--fuels a longing for an Abe Fortas or a Homer Thornberry.  As time goes on, reflection on the former's abdication from the Court and the latter's forgotten nomination will become all the more painful.  For now, one can only hope that a turnover in November will bring new perspective to Court nominations, should a vacancy occur.  And further that those reporters who now face the choice of imprisonment or incrimination of their sources will, in the true spirit of the Constitution, choose the former.</span></p>"}

{"title": "LADY THAT'S NO BANANA... | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>To the Editors of the <b>Crimson:</b></span></p> <p><span>I sincerely hope that the reporting of Rathborne and Luskin is usually more accurate than it was when they reviewed the Green Turtle and Ferdinand's Restaurant in your July 7th issue.  I have never eaten at the Green Turtle, but my husband is one of the owners of Ferdinand's; and although your reviewers are entitled to their opinions.  I would like to correct several untruths reported as facts.</span></p> <p><span>Ferdinand's is not open for lunch from 11:00-2:00 as they stated.  We serve lunch from 11:30-2:30 Monday thru Friday, 12:00-3:00 on Saturday and not at all on Sunday.  They did manage to get the evening hours correct.</span></p> <p><span>Another minor inaccuracy (I say minor because it has nothing to do with the food but nevertheless shows how bad the reporting was) was the description of the dining rooms.  They are not oaken as stated.  One is dark stained pine planks, one is painted and one is papered.  As to the reference to the \"Dubuffet reporductions on the walls,\" that is just plain laughable in its ignorance.  The artist's name happens to be Bernard Buffet, he enjoys some small amount of fame, and the one Buffet we have is an original.  It seems the eyes that mistakenly reported oaken walls everywhere also misread the signature of an artist they were unfamiliar with.</span></p> <p><span>Your reviewers maintain that we \"charge excessive prices for mediocre food.\"  We are not cheep.  We do not pretend to be.  You cannot serve prime beef, use real butter, make all your sauces from scratch, and use fresh fruit and fresh potatoes (even for the boiled ones) and have a particularly inexpensive menu.  My statements can easily be checked.  Come over and I'll being made fresh before each meal and the Prime stamp on the meat.</span></p> <p><span>Your reviewers mentioned Chicken Livers Provencale.  If you can find that on our menu, I'd like to know about it.  As far as I know, it isn't there.  They also said the salad dressing contained pickle relish.  We do not put pickle in any form in our salad dressing.  Mrs. McGovern took a bottle of it with her last time the dined at Ferdinand's and she said it was fantastic.  I realize that that is only one person's opinion and Rathborne and Luskin need not agree with it, but please don't report as fact that there is pickle relish in the salad dressing when you haven't the faintest idea of how it is made and obviously have even less idea after tasting it.</span></p> <p><span>The statement that our \"fresh fruit in Kirsh wasn't really:  the fruit was canned, topped with a lone fresh strawberry, and what may have been a fresh banana\" was the crowning blow, especially to the cook who spends considerable time peeling, coring and cutting up all that fresh fruit that really is.  We have never used canned fruit and the supposedly expert taste that detected canned and the supposedly discriminating eye that saw the banana was wrong again.  We don't put bananas, canned or otherwise, in our fresh fruit.  Perhaps there is not a great deal of difference to the casual diner between fresh fruit and canned fruit (although we think there is), but one expects more from a \"restaurant reviewer\" doesn't one?  And I do think it is grossly unfair to your readers to have a review about food written by someone who can't even recognize a pickle or a banana.</span></p> <p><span>We appreciate constructive criticism.  We realize everyone cannot like everything on our menu and we realize that some may prefer a different atmosphere.  These are all legitimate differences of opinion and we respect them.  But when someone states as the truth all the untruths mentioned above, it is time to refute them.  I believe that the article by Rathborne and Luskin was a blatant misrepresentation of the facts and an inexcusable display of ignorance.</span></p> <p><span>I have some constructive criticism for Rathborne and Luskin.  If I were you, I would take basic cooking course somewhere, anywhere, and stick with it at least until you can recognize a banana--it'll be tough but you can do it!  And after you've mastered that, take a good basic course in Art Appreciation before you \"posture\" as an art critic, too.  And then go to some really nice hot dog stand and have a really good meal, you know, a hot dog with lots of pickle relish on it--or was that a hamburger??  Oh well, hamburger, hot dog, they're so similar.  Doesn't everyone get them confused</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Candidate | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Hollywood has rarely made a film on a political subject that is both socially accurate and respectful of human dignity.  So it's no wonder that American audiences have come to expect superficial cynicism as the acceptable tone of \"progressive\" American filmmaking efforts; leave Tolstoy to the comp lit classroom, leave the values of foreign filmmakers as diverse as Godard, Pontecorvo, or Costa-Gavras to their one-shot or arthouse audiences.</span></p> <p><span><i>The Candidate</i> has been hailed as one of the few satisfying films made about American politics.  And it is an incredibly accurate portrait of the campaign travails that any hopeful for the electoral big-time must go through.  However, it is a film that lacks both heart and an intellectual center of gravity.  Written and produced by what must be serious, talented people, it comes off dilettante-ish.</span></p> <p><span>The main problem is simple:  for a film constructed like a character study, it lacks a developed hero.  Bill McKay, crusading San Diego lawyer son of an old-time machine-politics California governor, is chosen by Democratic organizers to run in a senatorial campaign conceded to the Republican incumbent, Crocker Jarmon, McKay stands for all the right issues--welfare, socialized medicine, ecology; Jarmon for all the wrong ones--law-and-order, budget-cutting, the rights of American individualists.  (The filmmakers have not mentioned Vietnam in a vain attempt to reduce the chance of incipient outdatedness).</span></p> <p><span>The main thematic line is straightforward:  as McKay comes ever-closer to winning his prize, he must rely ever-more on TV and other mass media to win his audience, in the process becoming less of a statesman, but a potent show-biz vote-getter.  However, whether director Michael Ritchie and screenwriter Jeremy Larner feel this process necessary, and McKay's actions morally justified, is unclear.  In the context of easy ironies that the film develops, in which all men are power-hungry or venal on a solely personal level, it is foolish to invoke moral considerations at all:  though I presume that the attitude the filmmakers wanted to express was \"this is the way the system works, and if we want to change it from within, we will have to temper our idealism.\"  (Pretty apt sentiments for today, coming from a pre-McGovern production).  In effect, the film as it stands says:  give the right personality-pushers an amiable fellow who thinks right but can hold his tongue, and they'll make a hero out of him.  (Which is not at all the same thing, and not very likely).</span></p> <p><span>For McKay never does believe in the American political system--he accepts the senatorial match as a joke, on the condition that he'll be able to speak his mind fully, and when he wins the California Democratic primary, and the nature of his campaign changes, we're never quite sure why he goes along with it.</span></p> <p><span>There are still several subsidiary themes which are far more interesting than anything Hollywood's put out since <i>All the King's Men.</i> There is the recognition of California as a cultureless, bullshit-laden playground for politicos, with a populace easily persuaded by ballsy New York admen who have survived the urban social torments most Californians have tried to escape.  There is the depiction of political groupies, limousine liberals, and union stumblebums, which have rarely been so strongly labeled by their proper names.  There is, finally, the demonstration of the wizardry by which we can be sucked in emotionally through mechanical manipulation of words and images--a virtual child's garden of McGuinness.</span></p> <p><span>Apart from its serious pretensions, the film is consistently entertaining.  Larner's dialogue is deadly accurate:  it takes a sharp ear to pick up the proper colloquial uses of such Yiddishism as <i>\"schmuck\"</i> and <i>\"kischkes\";</i> to imitate to perfection varying political jargons, from Jarmon's \"the individuals made this country great\" to McKay's \"we're all in this (mess) together\"; to invent speech idiosyncrasies which seal characters' fates for us, like a noxious emcee's \"unequivocably.\"</span></p> <p><span>The acting is also topnotch.  Robert Redford's McKay is a perfect seemingly sexless but actually hungry, American idealist; MeIvyn Douglas is fine as his corrupt father; Don Porter, veteran of fatherly roles in TV sitcoms, is well-cast as Crocker Jarmon--rhetorically smooth, with the sincerity of a born exhibitionist and a rockribbed physical facade.  But Peter Boyle steals the show as Marvin Lucas, McKay's mysterious New York-based campaign manager.  Lucas is tough, and smart, and flexible, a Madison Avenue superman; but in his own oily way we feel he cares more seriously than anyone else in the drama about the election's outcome--and he alone almost raises the level of the picture to tragicomedy.</span></p> <p><span>Michael Ritchie's direction is virtuosic, but cold for my taste, and given to too many cheap Kubrickian effects.  The people in his crowds are apt to be repulsive, the workers in his campaign hallways too obviously on the make.  His camera movements are both straightforward and slickly calculated.</span></p> <p><span>Then again, much of the slickness comes from California itself.</span></p> <p><span>In sum, <b>The Candidate</b> is not about the Kennedys, though their resonances are present; nor McCarthy, though whole incidents are openly borrowed from Larner's own campaign experiences; nor about McGovern, though George's campaign seems to have followed the same route as Bill McKay's.  Finally, the film's central figure is nowhere as serious as any of these men, and the film fails to engage us importantly because of this</span></p>"}

The sickly, rural smell of the feeds mixes with the pork smell and the hydrocarbons and the hot dust that blow into the one-room headquarters.  Inside, there is a five-foot high, very grainy litho of Wallace with about half a smile, and on a card-table there are the usual bumper stickers, buttons, pamphlets--plus a big pickle jar full of bills and change:  Wallace supporters pay for this material.</span></p> <p><span>On this oppressively average day, hot for early April, the gentleman at the desk is heavy, sweaty, and uneasy in his neat suit with the shiny blue tie spelling his man's name in silver letters down his chest--all too predictable.  He gives me literature, but has little to say.</span></p> <p><span>The pamphlets talk about rededicating ourselves to faith in America and in God, and claim that Wallace is the only candidate to sense the real feeling of the people:  \"He truly cares.  He is truly concerned.  He is real.\"  I pick up <i>Impact 72:  A Newspaper for Young Americans</i> and scan the inside topic, \"Right On, by George C. Wallace;\" \"Charisma!  Charisma!  Charisma!\"; \"The Wisdom of Wallace:  The Magic of Dreams, The Fabric of Freedom...\"; \"No Generation Gap in the Wallace Family.\"  Other themes are just as predictable--the old values made new, George Wallace standing up boldly, honestly, for an America of free enterprise, religion, and the family.</span></p> <p><span>\"Send 'em a Message\" runs one of the big slogans--a message mainly about two symbolic issues:  \"the busin'\" and \"the welfare.\"  Government has withdrawn to the snug offices of a distant Washington bureaucracy which subjugates practical men to the dictates of \"pointy-heads.\"  <i>They</i> are destroying our schools for the sake of the minorities, <i>they</i> are taking our money and giving it away.</span></p> <p><span>The man with that tie warms up when I mention Wallace's strong finish in the Wisconsin primary the day before.  \"Yes,\" he drawls with a smile, \"and that was their home country too.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>II</b></span></p> <p><span><b>R</b>ALEIGH IS THE state capital, 120,000 and growing rapidly with burgeoning state government and an influx of northern corporations.  Durham, twenty-five miles away, seems less a city than an over-grown small town.  After the Civil War, a man named Duke made the tobacco factories and they in turn made the city.  Now the factories fill Durham with their distinctive odor.  When shifts change, thousands of black and white khakied workers leave the big buildings to go pretty much their own separate ways.</span></p> <p><span>Just to the west of the factories, the money from Mr. Duke's enterprise created one of the finest Southern universities.  Still further west lies the most recent of Durham's big institutions, the black-owned North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, in a tall modern building which is by far the most impressive structure in the city.</span></p> <p><span>North Carolina Mutual has created a couple of black millionaires and numerous black executives in the city, and serves as the symbolic focus for one of the most progressive and best organized black communities in the South.  Downtown in Durham, Chisholm buttons are frequent; even now, a month before the primary, the New York Congresswoman has made several appearances in the state.</span></p> <p><span>But Edmund Muskie, his campaign faltering, has already decided not to campaign here, which leaves Wallace, Chisholm, and Durham's own candidate, Duke University President Terry Sanford.</span></p> <p><span>Sanford had been North Carolina's Kennedy-era governor, pushing bigger education budgets, what was then a moderate racial policy, and an early state anti-poverty program.  After leaving office in 1965, he headed a Ford Foundation study on the role of the states which produced the book <i>Storm Over the States</i>--a soundly liberal reformulation of a favorite Wallace focus.  In 1968, Sanford passed up a shot at Sen. Sam J. Ervin in the Democratic primary, got on several lists of potential Democratic vice-presidential nominees, and ended up heading Citizens for Humphrey-Muskie.  His political career seemed at least temporarily thwarted, so he took the Duke presidency in 1970.</span></p> <p><span>Now, at 54, he had used Duke and the University of North Carolina students as a base to get 25,000 names on petitions for a spot on the Presidential primary ballot.  He hopes to emerge as a dark-horse choice in a dead-locked convention, or, at least, as a vice-presidential possibility with proven power to keep Southern Democrats away from Wallace.</span></p> <p><span><b>III</b></span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE CORE OF Wallace support is the familiar, almost archetypal poor white southerner, often surprising in the breadth of his populism, often frightening in the intensity of his discontent.  His epitome seems to lie somewhere between two men I talked to on a little side street only a few hundred yards from Sanford's university.  It's a dead-end street, with about a dozen small white houses with porches and yards tiny enough for playing children to have trodden away all the grass.  The tobacco factories are within walking distance, and even closer are streets where black people live; indeed, on one nearby block the two races face each other across the unpaved street.</span></p> <p><span>Mr. Jones:  \"I can help you a lot\" he says when I ask him what people are thinking about the primary.  \"I've lived a lot of places in this country, my wife's from Pennsylvania, and I think I'm a pretty typical fellow.\"  He seems a hard man, with dark black hair and a dirty t-shirt.  He was for Lindsay, he tells me, and waits to enjoy my surprise.  \"I believe what the country needs is an all-round liberal man, but if Lindsay is dropping out, I'm for Wallace because he's against this forced busin' and he's the only one who is.\"  There's a lot he doesn't like about Wallace though, having lived for a while in Alabama under his high sales tax.  He sees through Nixon; that China trip was a stunt, he says, and we are leaving Vietnam without having finished the job--plus getting licked too.</span></p> <p><span>Mr. Graves:  Outside his house is parked an old sky-blue school bus bearing the words \"Freewill Independent Baptist Church\" and, on the back, bumper stickers:  \"Jesus Saves,\" \"Have You Read Your Bible Today?\"  Mr. Graves has the gentle, fearful eyes of a ten-year-old but the brown weathered skin of a life-long construction worker.  He seems afraid I will scold him for what he tells me.  He mumbles a bit when he says he's for Wallace, but his embarrassment is not doubt.  Busing comes up quickly:  \"You can't change a hundred years--or more I guess--in ten.\"  He's afraid his kids will be beaten up if they go to the public schools and for this reason--and \"for religion\"--he sends them to one of the new white private schools.  Freedom of choice--he just can't understand why that isn't enough.  You can't change people's hearts by laws:  \"You can't lead a mule to water, but boy you shore can't make that rascal <i>drink.\"</i></span></p> <p><span>At first he touches religion only gingerly, afraid to offend me.  But I press him.  Does he think religion ought to be carried into politics?  He does, and with real emotion he claims that he puts love of Jesus Christ and belief in the truth of the King James version of the Bible above anything else, even his family.  He drives the school bus to Sunday school, and guesses that the reason he doesn't like even the word liberal comes from his belief in religion, his faith that the old King James version is the only true one.  And when he learns that, no, I am not saved, his comment is straight from Pascal:  \"Well if I'm right I've gained everything, and if I'm not, well then what have I lost?  But you've lost everything either way when you die.\"</span></p> <p><span>He has no job now, and knows that the men who are hurting are not the skilled union men who get five dollars an hour--he thinks those unions ought to be taken down a notch or two--but the hundred-dollar-a-week men with a family to support.  But mainly he's concerned about foreign policy, and keeping up our defenses.  \"If a man tries to take something from you, you ought to be strong enough to put the hurt on him.\"  Wallace is right on the war:  you know we could have won it in sixty days if we hadn't held back.</span></p> <p><span><b>IV</b></span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>ACK IN RALEIGH, I wait for an interview at the headquarters, and down a Pepsi--another popular Southern invention.  The big man working at the gas station gets gruff when I ask him how many people he's seen going in over there.  \"I hope nobody does, I hope nobody votes for that son-of-a-bitch.  I'm for Humphrey,\" and he roars with laughter.  Should I believe him?</span></p> <p><span>Lewis Purdy, county co-ordinator for the campaign, a tall, gray-haired businessman whom I thought must be a deacon, predicts that Wallace will win with 40-55 per cent of the vote and that Sanford will be forced to fulfill his promise of dropping out if he \"couldn't beat George Wallace.\"  Purdy lists his candidate's appeals, focusing on busing and economics.  He mentions corporations but more directly \"these multi-billion dollar foundations using their money to foment revolution and subsidize these way-out, left things.\"  He raises the familiar, often accurate charge of press hostility and neglect toward Wallace.</span></p> <p><span>While I'm at the headquarters, several state workers on lunch break come in, take literature and stickers but refuse to sign the register.  They are afraid of losing their jobs, they say, and when I talk to others, down near the capitol, they too look wary and refuse to comment on the election.</span></p> <p><span><b>V</b></span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HESE STATE WORKERS, many of them with rural backgrounds, are among those filling the new apartments and shopping centers now replacing the pine forests at the city's edge.  All over the state, the new suburbanites represent a crucial segment for this election.  The poor whites are frustrated enough to give Wallace firm support.  The real contest is for the loyalty of those who, if they vote for Wallace, will be silent about it, who, as Larry O'Brien has said, keep the Wallace vote in their gut.</span></p> <p><span>While the poor whites simply cling to the more comfortable past with a blind desperation, these new suburbanites are painfully split.  They see the America which shaped them and taught them to love her receding into the past along with their rural heritage, but the change is partly of their own choice, and that is their dilemma.  They have come to the city to become middle-class, to escape the country's simplicity, coarseness, and poverty, but the country still lingers in them, and compels nostalgia.  Along with the wealth and sophistication of the city have come new problems which conflict with these people's original simple goals, goals which were conceived in the country.  If the rural legacy in them should suddenly emerge, what they have gained in the city will still make them ashamed.</span></p> <p><span>The new middle class, feeling squeezed between institutions on top and the rising minorities below, must justify its accomplishment by a particular social myth.  It must idealize the simpler, more in- dividualistic society of the past.  It must reject racial equality because it symbolizes the new changes.  It must yearn for the real uniformity and closeness of the old society and pretend that they still exist:  there would not be such loyalty to the myth of the neighborhood school if the new suburbs really were neighborhoods of the old type.</span></p> <p><span>These people cannot accept busing and welfare because they cannot accept ideas of social determination, differing family backgrounds, or restrictive monopoly, without endangering the basic myth behind their own social mobility and their right to enjoy its rewards.  To preserve this myth, they must deny the complexity of contemporary society.</span></p> <p><span><b>VI</b></span></p> <p><span><b>A</b> FEW DAYS LATER, the <i>Raleigh News and Observer,</i> one of those few grand old, staunchly liberal Southern papers, prints a forceful editorial depicting the coming primary as a \"Dixie Classic,\" pitting Terry Sanford versus George Wallace (for now these were the only real choices), and a New South against the Old.</span></p> <p><span>The <i>New York Times</i> reports that the candidates are beginning to stump \"the dogwood-dappled state\" more in earnest now, although Wallace finds his Northern campaigns more attractive and plans only four or five stops.  Tom Wicker, originally of Hamlet, N.C., returns to the state to talk to Sanford, picks up the <i>News and Observer's</i> theme and writes about it in the <i>Times.</i></span></p> <p><span>And yet both Sanford and the hardly new notion of a New South are more complicated.  Much of the current New South is merely new without being Southern:  Sanford will find strength in the votes and influence of Yankees who have followed their companies south.  Sanford's broadest appeal, however, still remains traditionally Southern.  What Wallace lambastes as \"pussy-footin' around\", Sanford doesn't mind calling \"craw-fishing and covering up.\"  Perhaps the most widespread rationale behind his vote will be the need to preserve the respectability of the state, and the desire to see its banner carried into the highest levels of national politics.</span></p> <p><span><b>VII</b></span></p> <p><span>Wallace comes to Boston, and the next day gets ten per cent in the Massachusetts primary, twenty-one per cent in Pennsylvania on the basis of only a couple of hours campaigning in each place.  I see the South taken for granted as Wallace moves into the South of the North--wooing the hardhat, the migrated hill-billy, the ethnic angry at busing.  Under Webster's picture at Fanueil Hall, Wallace takes aim at his favorite targets:  the apparently bottomless pit of taxing and spending, taxing and spending; the phony slickness of television, \"kowtowing to the exotic and the noisemakers;\" the liberals who have gotten us in the no-win war in Vietnam and sent \"pointy-heads\" to make chaos in our schools.  But he can still conclude:  \"We have the best system in the world, you know that.\"  Directness and reassurance, stridence and personality.</span></p> <p><span><b>VIII</b></span></p> <p><span>On Saturday, May 6, after a week which has brought him overwhelming victory against no opposition in Tennessee, and a powerful (41 per cent) showing in Indiana, George Wallace polls just over half the votes cast in North Carolina.  Terry Sanford has 37 per cent; Chisholm 8 per cent, Muskie and Jackson are far behind</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Protest Vote | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>OMORROW'S Massachusetts primary offers us another opportunity to express our disgust with the latest escalation of the war in Southeast Asia by giving an overwhelming majority to the two Democratic candidates genuinely committed to ending American military involvement there, Sen. George S. McGovern (D.S.D.) and Rep. Shirley Chisholm (D.N.Y.) alone in a generally uninspiring Democratic field, display a determination to change Nixon policy that is not believable and possible.  They deserve the support of all those who are fed up with Vietnamization, protective reaction bombing, and anti-communist puppet regimes in Saigon.</span></p> <p><span>Both McGovern and Chisholm present clear alternatives to current U.S. policy: withdrawal from Indochina and drastic reordering of spending priorities.  McGovern advocates a #30 billion cut in defense spending as part of a massive dismantling of the military-industrial complex:  Chisholm has vowed to vote \"no\" on every money bill that allocates funds for defense.  Beyond this, both pledge to put the money saved on defence to other use.  McGovern has proposed a radical new tax program, closing loopholes and imposing a heavy inheritance tax. which would add another $120 billion in revenue to put into vast government-sponsored programs in housing, mass transit and environmental cleanup.  This would also allow for large increases in social security and a $1000 minimum annual income for everyone in the country Chisholm represents the communality of interests among block and white working classes and she sees civil rights legislation that is currently unenforced as part of a broader economic problem; her chief emphasis is on housing and feeding poor Americans of all races.</span></p> <p><span>There is another reason why McGovern and Chisholm are so far preferable to other Democratic candidates, a reason which transcends campaign pledges to shift policy; either would bring to the White House the honesty that has been so lamentably absent for the past decade.  Both McGovern and Chisholm base their campaign on grass roots support.  They represent for once the little man, the poor, and the jobless; further, they are tolerant of the full spectrum of political opinion, McGovern has survived 20 years of politicking by relying on individual contact and individual support.  He has been outspoken, and yet soft-spoken; Robert Kennedy once termed him the only decent man in the Senate, Chisholm, beyond her candidacy as the first black woman in Congress, prides herself on being \"unbought and unbossed.\"  She represents a figure whom young blacks, Puerto Ricans and other minorities can trust and whom corporations cannot touch.  At the same time, she refuses to lend her name to racial or ethnic separatism, appealing instead to a broad base of white and minority support.</span></p> <p><span>There are many ways to voice opposition to the Nixon Administration and its nightmarish insistence on following through the brutal undeclared war against the people of Vietnam.  Those who believe in the supremacy of the electoral system still maintain that the polls represent the single most crucial influence on government policy.  Perhaps, To be sure, a strong anti-Nixon vote in the primaries is one of the several ways to show opposition.  But just as surely, a vote tomorrow for anyone other than McGovern or Chisholm is a vote for the Democratic establishment-which may be able to put a new face but not a new policy, in the White House.  A Nixon-Muskie, Nixon-Jackson or, unbelievably, another Nixon-Humphrey ballot in November would offer no choice at all.  Nixon said in 1968 that he would get the U.S. out of Vietnam .</span></p> <p><span>* 20 million Americans believed him; Muskie and Humphrey say the same thing now, while giving appropriate attention to the Administration's domestic debacle, but they provide little reason to believe they will fulfill that promise.  If you can't vote against Nixon and against the Democratic machine tomorrow, then don't vote at all.  The choice is McGovern or Chisholm.  It is an important way to show Nixon that he cannot get way with the murder of a people without facing massive protests at home in the United States.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Strike Vote | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE EVACUATION OF Massachusetts Hall by Afro and PALC yesterday displayed once again the timing and organization which have characterized their seven-day occupation of the building.  The exit was carried out with style and bravado.  Unfortunately, the cohesiveness of Afro and PALC has not extended to the Harvard strike, which has fallen into complete disarray.  Tuesday night, after rejecting a motion to continue the strike in its present form, over one sixth of the persons at the Sanders Theatre strike meeting voted to reconsider the question.  It then passed by a 324-190 margin, and the meeting adjourned after two and a half hours of aimless debate, although there were 13 items on the agenda, the meeting was able to move only through the second subsection of the first item before adjournment.  At one point, only 15 persons voted on a question before the assembly.</span></p> <p><span>Even if Tuesday night's meeting had displayed some semblance of cohesion and had outlined specific goals for a continued strike, there would still be serious doubts as to how representative the opinions of 350 people can be.  Less than one third the number of last Thursday's original meeting attended Tuesday's session, and no unanimous of opinion was discernible even among that group.  No common goals, nor even any commonly-supported actions, were settled Tuesday night.</span></p> <p><span>Last week, we called for a nationwide student strike with a very specific goal:  displaying massive opposition to continued U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia.  Since then, there have been several forceful demonstrations of protest against Nixon policy in Indochina; these must continue, as often as possible, with as much support as possible.  But as we were careful to note before, any student strike or antiwar protests must center primarily on the war.  The lessons of the 1970 student strike are clear:  actions aimed at universities are misdirected and serve only to detract from the overall effectiveness of antiwar demonstrations.  The best example of this misdirection is the current mess at Columbia, where students and police have clashed off and on for the past week, proving nothing and turning public opinion against student protest.</span></p> <p><span>At Harvard, the strike and antiwar actions have veered from the central issue of the Indochina war.  In fact, Nixon's bombing of the North has been frequently neglected, lost in a morass of university-oriented issues.  The strike as it is currently constituted should end.  There is no real base of student support for its continuation.  But we should go on working in whatever ways possible to end America's reign of terror in Southeast Asia.  Students should return to class, but should be prepared to disrupt again their normal schedules and lend support to specific demonstrations of antiwar sentiment.  This sentiment must not be lost in a shuffle of university issues.</span></p>"}
{"title": "What Is To Be Done? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HERE ARE few better instances of Harvard's intellectual stupidity than that which evidenced itself at Tuesday night's mass meeting.  We, the \"Harvard community\"--whatever that means--have again voted to \"Strike\"--whatever <i>that</i> means.  Unfortunately, we have overlooked the technical detail:  specific strategies and actions by which we can enforce our demands against the government and the corporate structure of the United States.</span></p> <p><span>Lest we forget what brought us into this entire situation, there were two reasons for which this campus momentarily erupted into protest:  the drastic and brutal escalation of American air strikes inside North Vietnam, which seemed to foreshadow the possibility of a nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union, and the existence of a gruesome colonial war in Portugese Africa, financed by American corporations in which this University holds large amounts of stock.  Yet now, as if the wars against the Vietnamese and the Africans have faded into thin air, our original concerns seem to have lost their meaning.  What else could one have concluded from watching the Tuesday meeting, in which all of the central issues gave way to a largely academic discussion about whether Harvard was, or should be, \"on strike\"?</span></p> <p><span>Yet it was no wonder that the mass meeting degenerated into a useless verbal brawl, because the word \"strike\" has automatically, and unjustifiably become the central word in our vocabulary.  And it is a word that lacks any form of definition in its current context.  Under most circumstances, a \"strike\" is a stoppage of work undertaken for the purpose of winning a concrete concession.  Built into the word is a strong implication that the protest is directed against a single target.  Most importantly, \"strike\" means that in order to win our demands, we intend to deprive our opponent of something which he finds indispensable.  The trouble is that so far, we at Harvard have used the word \"strike\" in a knee-jerk and fetishistic manner, without really asking ourselves whom the target is, how long our action must take to be effective, and what we must take from our opponent before he realizes that his current course of action will backfire against him.</span></p> <p><span>In Spring 1970, there was a widely-held feeling that if only America's universities could be shut down, then students, once free from academic obligations, would throw themselves into political activity--against the government, in favor of anti-war candidates, against the universities, the targets scarcely mattered, the targets would evidence themselves--and the war would be brought to an end.  This approach, of course, failed; it failed because student attendance at class was not an essential factor in the operations of the universities or the war machine, it failed because even universities, no matter how strongly attacked, are not the primary agents of the war and cannot bring it to a close, and it failed because the students \"liberated\" from their classes did not have a strategy in mind--aside from closing universities--that could stop the war.</span></p> <p><span>When the struggle in Portuguese Africa was brought to our attention by the Pan-African Liberation Committee, and the existence of the Southeast Asian war was revived in our consciousness by the bombings against Hanoi and Haiphong, there was a large group of students interested in effective protest who were determined not to be undermined by the mistakes of 1970.  They understood that neo-colonial warfare did not grow primarily from the universities, but from Washington and the giant corporations which uphold it.  Even PALC, whose action was directed against Harvard, did not really have an attack on the University primarily in mind:  during their campaign of seven months' duration, they seriously hoped that a confrontation with Harvard would not be necessary because their foremost concern was not university complicity with the war in Angola but rather the war in Angola itself.  They believed that Harvard's divestiture, if ratified by the Corporation and announced forcefully by President Bok, would publicize the war outside Harvard and would perhaps contribute to a massive, popular movement in this country which could then cripple the Portuguese war effort by halting America's support of it.  To move Harvard from its intransigent position, they felt that militant action was necessary.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT A LARGELY different situation existed with the Vietnamese war.  There was no need to bring that war to public attention; the need was rather to mobilize the public--including that large but usually forgotten segment of the public which happens not to be situated on university campuses--against the government.  To men like Nixon, Kissinger, and the President of Gulf Oil, the level of domestic disruption which they cannot afford to risk is not be found in a boycott of classes; it is rather to be found in massive public disorder which threatens their ability to rule.  Our function should not be to prevent ideologists like Kissinger and Banfield from delivering lectures, but to make it impossible for them to operate or exert influence on an official level.</span></p> <p><span>Yet even those who held to this position before the first mass meeting of Thursday were mistakenly reluctant to confront the issue of what it means to \"strike.\"  In view of the chaos of the initial surge of protest, and the calamity which characterizes mass meetings, they decided not to confront the issue of \"strike\" in a direct fashion, assuming that everyone would ultimately see the wisdom of their position.  In so abdicating, they repeated a central mistake of 1970; they assumed that the correct political road would inevitably point its own way.  The result was almost pre-ordained; the crucial proposal passed at the Thursday night meeting contained the fatal passage about \"encouraging\" everyone to stay away from class.  And then, the Tuesday night meeting was consumed with theological disputes about whether we should all continue the \"strike.\"  The absurdity of the meeting reached high pitch when the sponsor of a proposal \"to end the boycott of classes\" announced that his motion could be considered a \"friendly amendment\" to another proposal which asked \"that all University students continue to strike.\"  With overlapping definitions, it was possible for someone to maintain that we could abandon the strike while we remained on strike, and few people raised a whimper.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T WOULD indeed be miraculous if this nonsensical debate has not already convinced many students that all of our protest has now become silly and useless.  But if we are ever to build a successful movement against neo-colonial wars, we must take this idea of \"strike\" and put it back on the shelf, where it belongs.  If people wish to attend class, we should not waste time preventing them from doing so.  We should instead concentrate on proposals for concrete, politically sensible courses of direct action.  And if our actions are logical and appealing, more and more people will join us and we will have accomplished far more than those who insisted that before building a mass movement, they must first utter the word \"strike.\"</span></p>"}

The tone of Monday night's statement was very soothing, as if people ought to somehow believe that the bombing and interdiction of supplies destined for North Vietnam would not have any unfortunate consequences other than the minor ones planned by the mindful crisis managers in Washington.</span></p> <p><span>President Nixon has said that his actions do not provide the Soviets with any reason to cancel the Moscow summit, because--as Nixon thinks he knows well--none could possibly threaten the Soviet Union's \"legitimate\" interests.  However, when he told the nation that the North Vietnamese had been totally intransigent at the secret negotiations last Tuesday in Paris, Nixon did more than just imply that the Soviets--who had promised Dr. Kissinger that North Vietnam would negotiate seriously--had failed to keep their word.</span></p> <p><span>Actually, the North Vietnamese negotiators gave the U.S. a guarantee that there would be no \"communist takeover\" or \"bloodbath\" if Thieu resigned.  As Madame Binh said at the public negotiations on Thursday, and the North Vietnamese delegate affirmed:</span></p> <p><span>The Provisional Revolutionary Government does not demand monopoly of control on political life in South Vietnam.  A \"takeover\" as the United States puts it simply does not exist.  On the contrary, we stand for the achievement of board national concord.</span></p> <p><span>Madame Binh's statement merely reflects the reality that non-communists must continue to play a crucial role in South Vietnam.  Many of these people have earned enough--thanks to years of U.S. generosity--to form a rural and urban middle class.  The PRG knows fully well that it would have to cooperate with these people for there to be any chance to heal South Vietnam's war wounds.</span></p> <p><span>Since Hanoi did offer the U.S. a viable proposal with which to end U.S. involvement in \"honor,\" the Soviet leaders may well conclude that the U.S. preferred hegemony in South Vietnam to \"honor.\"  Whatever steps the Soviets decide to take--and these are still unknown at the time of writing--the Moscow leaders will have to keep another important fact in mind:  they overthrew their predecessor Khruschev who was ineffectual and who backed down at the expense of an ally in the face of U.S. demands at the time of the Cuban missile crisis.</span></p> <p><span>Whether the present Soviet leaders will risk the fate of their predecessor is still unclear.

{"title": "Thomson:  'No Substitute for Failure' | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>The following statement was made by James C. Thomson Jr., lecturer on History and former Far East-aide at the Department of State and National Security Council Staff, 1961-66, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>I</b> AM GRATEFUL FOR THE opportunity to testify before this distinguished Committee on the origins and lessons of the Indochina War.</span></p> <p><span>I must add, however, that I am astounded to be doing so while that war continues in yet a new phase of escalated American involvement in this fifth month of the year 1972.  Had I been told, as a State Department official ten years ago or as a National Security Council staff member seven years ago, that the United States would still be a Vietnam war participant in 1972, I would have been utterly incredulous.  Most of my colleagues would have been equally disbelieving.</span></p> <p><span>All of us--policy-makers, legislators, and citizens alike--have been exposed by now to more data, documents, exhortations, and preachments about this war than any other unresolved crisis in our history.  Let me try, therefore, to summarize very briefly my own views on the matter:</span></p> <p><span>1. American participation in Vietnam hostilities is a step that could have and should have been avoided.  Once begun, it should have and could have been ended at several junctures.  Today, this week, is only the most recent of such junctures.</span></p> <p><span>2. The Vietnam region, an Asian colonial appendage, was a region governed so badly by its French colonial rulers from the later 19th century through 1940 that Vietnamese nationalism and Vietnamese communism largely coalesced during the struggle against first France, then Japan, and then France again.  As a result of such coalescence, such fusion, the leadership of the Vietnamese revolution for independence and nationhood had largely fallen under the control of long indigenous Vietnamese Communists by the mid and late 1940s.  Ho Chi Minh was the George Washington of Vietnam, whatever we may think of his politics, though like George Washington he had to struggle against \"loyalist\" pro-French elements within the bureaucracy, army and intelligentsia.</span></p> <p><span>3. Vietnam was, further, a colonial region in which the French so delayed and bungled the opportunities for post-1945 graceful withdrawal that they were eventually forced out by Ho and General Giap in 1954 under fairly ignominious circumstances.  Moreover--a sadly important point for us--they were forced out at a time when the United States had been suddenly traumatized by the Cold War in Europe, the so-called \"loss of China,\" and then the Korean War.</span></p> <p><span>4. Against this backdrop, America's progressive involvement went through several very separate stages.  First Washington acquiesced in the French return to Indochina and then financed the French war there largely for reasons that had nothing to do with Asia but rather, as Mr. Acheson and others have revealed, as the price required to win French participation in West European defense arrangements.  (By 1954 that price totalled $4 billion.)  But with the Communist victory in China.  Washington developed a second rationale, namely, resistance to what was wrongly perceived as monolithic international communism:  Peking and Hanoi as mere creations and puppets of Moscow.  Such a false perception was intensified by the outbreak of the Korean War and China's eventual entry into that war as MacArthur marched to the Yalu.  From this point on, Washington saw Chinese-directed communism \"spilling out\" all over Asia, and Vietnam became merely one break in the dike.</span></p> <p><span>5. Hence, Washington's further blunder of disassociating the U.S. from the 1954 Geneva Accords and gradually moving in to replace the French and help upset those Accords--all on the false assumption of Communism's monolithic special nature and force of Vietnamese national-communism--a gradually escalating commitment to a historical, political, and logistical swamp that any great power should have known enough to avoid.</span></p> <p><span>6. And ahence, further, the compounding of these initial blunders through escalatory intervention by two Administrations in an unfinished Vietnamese civil war from 1961 onward while pretending that it was not a civil war.  In conjunction with these moves, policy-makers sought to explain such involvement to the American people by developing a public description of what was at stake in Vietnam that bore little relevance to reality but created, <i>de facto,</i> a new reality through rhetorical escalation; in other words, Vietnam became of supreme importance largely because we <i>said</i> it was of supreme importance.</span></p> <p><span>7. None of this, I would add, was the result of criminal or malevolent men, either in Washington or necessarily in Southeast Asia.  Most of it was the result of ignorance, shortsightedness, fear, frustration, and fatigue--though ignorance, short-sightedness, fear frustration, and fatigue can, in fact, lead to and have led to criminal consequences.</span></p> <p><span>Let me deal at once with one obvious rejoinder to the preceding capsulized account.  Vietnam obviously confronted American policy-makers with a situation where, if Washington had not intervened, a good many innocent anti-communists would have suffered in the course of civil war and revolution.  But even if it were argued that we should be in the business of rescuing oppressed peoples from their compatriots on a worldwide basis (a dubious proposition), I would suggest that infinitely more suffering has been inflicted--and continues to be inflicted today--on people in both Vietnams and in Laos and Cambodia by our intervention than would have occurred if we hadn't interveneo.  Those who have warned for years of the impending \"bloodbath\" must face the grim reality of the daily bloodbath we have imposed on Indochina.  Here, indeed, is one of the most striking cases in modern history of a cure far worse than the disease.</span></p> <p><span>As for that other recurrent rejoinder, the so-called \"domino theory,\" such simplistic formulations are a cover for sloppy thinking.  As anyone who knows that nation's tortured history must see, Vietnam is a special and peculiar mix of ingredients--unique, not general, or a \"test case.\"  What happens there tells us nothing very useful about the future anywhere else.  Moreover, the consequences of Communist success there must therefore be examined with special care and precision; and such examination indicates that it would not have ramifications of real significance beyond the three Indochina states already affected--except, of course, for the commonplace of a \"ripple\" effect which is a far cry from the vision of falling dominoes.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b> AM CONVINCED, HOWEVER, that \"dominoism\" does contain one important kernel of reality.  For as I review the record of our Indochina involvement.  I detect--as Daniel Ellsberg has put it--one crucial domino that seems to have obsessed each American President since Mr. Truman:  namely, the Administration in power in Washington.  By this I mean that each President has sensed a \"lesson\" from the Democrats' so-called \"loss of China\" in 1949 and their defeat at the polls in 1952--and has concluded that the \"loss\" of South Vietnam to communism will bring about his own Administration's downfall at the next general election.</span></p> <p><span>One has heard from men in high positions at each stage of this convulsive tragedy that \"no constructive alternative\" to escalation was offered or available.  The fact of the matter, however, is that at every stage alternatives have been offered, both from inside and outside the government.  All of them were allegedly unpalatable at the time since they all ran the risk of a Communist take-over in South Vietnam.  Yet all of them were proved progressively more palatable in retrospect once the opportunity was missed.  There were thingswe could, and should, have done a year ago, two years ago, three, five, ten years ago, that are substantially harder to do today--except that the American people may at last be learning.  They were proposed at the time; and they were rejected at each stage because the short-term price of not doing them and continuing, instead, on the same course.  But the long-term price of not doing them turns out to be compounded daily and hourly.</span></p> <p><span>How, now, can we end the Indochina war?</span></p> <p><span>In my view, the answer is fairly simple:  by trying the one thing we have not tried--honesty.  Specifically, by having the greatness to admit national error, the intelligence to act on that admission, and the compassion to do it quickly.</span></p> <p><span>To put the matter bluntly:  in some wars there is simply no substitute for failure.  It is high time to face the long evident truth:  that our South Vietnamese clients are the losing faction of a revolutionary civil war, could not have lasted the past decade without us, and today will not last a week without our constant bombardment of their adversaries and their own people.  There may be way-stations, even fairly enduring ones, to the ultimate outcome of Communist domination in the South--for instance, a coalition government.  But a cold calculation of Vietnamese interest, as well as ours, should persuade us to acquiesce in that ultimate outcome.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HAT WE SO DESPERATELY have needed is something no President has had the courage to face and to tell the American people:  that Vietnam was \"lost\" to Vietnamese national Communism many years ago, by the French, by Americans, but mostly by Vietnamese; that nothing short of perpetual war might \"retrieve\" that loss (and at what cost!); that the loss doesn't matter in terms of American security interests and indeed has never mattered; and that an admission of error and failure that brings peace to a shattered region is far from \"national humiliation,\" as Mr. Nixon once called it, but is rather the first step toward national regeneration, an act of true national courage.</span></p> <p><span>What would be the results of such a message from the Presidency?</span></p> <p><span>We have been warned, for as long as I served in Government and now by those in the Nixon Administration, of the \"right-wing backlash,\" the new \"loss of China\" witch-hunt, that would follow such a move.  We have been warned of the headlong flight into \"isolationism\" or \"neoisolationism\" that would ensue.  Are these real dangers?</span></p> <p><span>The first, a \"backlash,\" seems probable in some form in the wake of virtually any outcome short of \"victory.\"  It is simply a fact of life:  the inescapable price open societies must pay for righting a major and prolonged wrong.  But it is also very clearly containable in the present instance--thanks largely to the overwhelming agenda of things to be done at home and elsewhere in the world, thanks also to the media that have brought this war's insanity into every living-room, thanks hopefully to effective executive leadership.</span></p> <p><span>As for the second danger--\"isolationism\"--it seems highly improbable.  We have been over-invested, over-committed, over-extended in parts of the world, and particularly in East Asia, over the past twenty years:  indeed, the so-called Nixon Doctrine wisely acknowledges that fact.  But disinvestment in one area, and indeed, pullback in Asia, cannot in this day and age mean anything like what those who grew up in the twenties and thirties so much fear.  We are simply too globally involved, through communications, technology, trade, travel, economic investment, diplomacy, and our special status as a nuclear power, to return to anything resembling the dream of Fortress America.</span></p> <p><span>This is not to suggest that the formula I offer will have easy consequences--for there is, of course, no easy way out of our present Southeast Asian crisis.  But it can, under the right leadership, move us gradually toward something new and precious:  a tempering of our national grandiosity, an end to our special sense of benevolence as a nation--an erosion of the ugly qualities that accompany such overweaning confidence, including excessive fear of \"loss\" or \"failure\".  It can lead, in time, toward a new national maturity:  a sense that we are only one of many, and that we cannot transform the world by ourselves.</span></p> <p><span>And it can lead, in the process, to a new degree of candor in our Government's relations with its own citizens and a new degree of respect by the citizens for their government.  We can thereby begin to cleanse ourselves of the war's most debilitating poison:  collective deception and national self-deception.</span></p> <p><span>I believe that one great step toward such health, Mr. Chairman, would be the creation of a blue-ribbon bipartisan national commission to reflect upon this quarter-century tragedy and to distill its lessons for the future.  I have in mind the creation, by the President or, if necessary, by the Congress, of a National Commission on the Causes, Conduct, and Consequences of the Indochina War.  Such a proposal is not new.  But it seems to me more imperative than ever that we make every effort to move from recrimination to reflection and understanding.  I would hope that such a Commission would be given access to all archives pertaining to the war--not merely the Pentagon study, but all others as well--and would take testimony from every level of participant.  I would suggest that it be given a substantial period of time for its undertaking--perhaps two or three years.  And I would hope that its ultimate fundings might not merely point the finger of guilt, where appropriate, at all levels of the decision-making and war-waging process but might also recommend a \"general amnesty\" for all:  for Presidents, their civilian advisers, and their military officials from general down through the ranks, and also for those whose consciences caused them to choose jail or to flee the country, rather than serve in the Vietnam War.</span></p> <p><span>.......</span></p> <p><span>Mr. Chairman:  I listened to President Nixon on the television last night.  And I heard tragedy compounded.</span></p> <p><span>Faced with the failure of so-called \"Vietnamization,\" the failure of negotiations, and the failure of rhetorical and military deterrence, he confronted now the predictable and the very long predicted:  a renewal of the Vietnamese revolutionary war under the leadership of North Vietnam's men with a cause, and the impending collapse of will among South Vietnamese who have little or no cause.  And what has he done?  He has decreed two vital U.S. stakes in Vietnam--the one entirely phoney, and the other unachievable.  He tells us that our 60,000 residual American troops are threatened--and what better way to resolve that problem, one might ask, than to withdraw them?  And he tells us that the 17 million South Vietnamese are in danger of being taken over by communism--a distinct possibility and eventual probability for the past twenty years.  Furthermore, he has reelevated this pitiful conflict to superpower and global levels of potentialdestruction by imposing an undeclared blockade on North Vietnam and by moving into direct confrontation with the Soviet Union.  Finally, he does these things, he tells us, because no longer is merely \"the presidency\" at stake, as he had said last month, but our \"honor\" is at stake.  He asks us, in closing, for \"the same support you have always given your President.\"</span></p> <p><span>The President's path is the path of national insanity.  The invocation of national honor over pathetically misjudged stakes has been tried before.  The invocation of support for the presidency has been tried before.  The conscious invocation of superpower collision has heretofore been carefully avoided by proud but prudent men.  But national honor is not what beleaguered presidents define it to be; it is greater and more enduring.  And blind support for presidents is at the very taproot of our continuing Indochina calamity.  As for conscious invocation of superpower collision, that is a course totally unjustified by the stakes, by the history, and by the issue itself.</span></p> <p><span>Once again a President has stated the choices falsely.  If this President genuinely wants peace, if he genuinely seeks the release of our prisoners, if he is genuinely concerned about our 60,000 remaining troops, and if he genuinely cares about the fate of 17 million South Vietnamese, he must take two long essential steps toward real peace:  the first, proposed six years ago by the late Robert Kennedy, an offer at long last to agree to the formation of a coalition government in South Vietnam; and the second, proposed repeatedly by members of this Congress, the clear and final setting of a deadline for total withdrawal of all American forces from Indochina.</span></p> <p><span>Only then can the people of Indochina begin to be relieved of the nightmare we have helped inflict upon them.  And only then can the people of America emerge from their own far lesser nightmare</span></p>"}

Such an analysis suggests that Harvard's ownership of Gulf stock is the sole blemish on a pure university.</span></p> <p><span>But the $21 million of Gulf stock is part of a portfolio that includes over $10 million each of stock in Polaroid (the company that brought you colonialism in South Africa and identity cards in the United States).  Middle South Utilities (a leading practitioner of racism in Mississippi). International Telephone and Telegraph, and American Telephone and Telegraph (one of the top defense contractors in the nation, and the country's best example of sexism in employment according to a recent report of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission).</span></p> <p><span>And lest we forget:  Harvard is the school that gave the United States Henry Kissinger, war criminal summon cum laude, and Samuel Huntington, a leading ideologue of counter-insurgency:  Kissinger may yet be welcomed back to sherry and scholarship at Harvard.  Kissinger and Huntington are not alone:  Harvard professors Roger Fisher (Law), George Kistiakowsky (Chemistry, Emeritus).  Tom Cheatham (Engineering and Applied Physics) and Edward Purcell (Physics) have served on committees advising the government on military strategy and technology.  Fisher and Kistiakowsky are among the originators of the \"automated battlefield\" program which now blankers Indochina with blind, mechanized destruction.  Harvey Brooks Dean of the Division of Engineering and Applied Physics, is on the board of Raytheon, the largest military contractor in Massachusetts--and this is only the most glaring of numerous interlocks between the Harvard faculty and local warmakers.</span></p> <p><span>Clearly Harvard's complicity in American imperialism extends far beyond the ownership of Gulf stock.  With such obvious ties to the war machine at home, we must challenge the elitist Harvard assumption that the problem is only \"out there.\"</span></p> <p><span>The <b>Crimson</b> editorials are partly a reaction to events in the spring of 1970 that are not relevant to our present situation.  At that time radicals isolated themselves from liberal anti-war students by focusing on the grievances of a handful of campus workers and by shutting down dorms.  However, a campaign against Harvard's investment policy or counterinsurgency research could have been more organically related to the prevalent anti-war sentiment while broadening the understanding of the university's complcity in the war.  The <b>Crimson's</b> reaction to the events of 1970 has been to translate the narrowly anti-war sentiment that was of value then to a period in which radicals should be educating people about the role which universities and other giant corporations have played in the war.</span></p> <p><span>The actions advocated and given most enthusiastic and prominent coverage in the <b>Crimson</b> have been \"confrontations\" with the atmosphere of a class picnic.  Local radicals have choreographed a series of civil disobedience actions which pose only a trivial threat to illegitimate authority.  Traffic was rerouted briefly for the sit-down in Post Office Square; the Cambridge Draft Board and the Gulf offices were open for busienss as usual shortly after the demonntrators left.  Surely by no stretch of the imagination could such actions be considered \"massive public disorder\" which threatens the ability of Nixon, Kissinger and the President of Gulf Oil to rule.</span></p> <p><span>In contrast to the <b>Crimson</b> strategy of endless and ineffectual off-campus demonstrations, we advocate active support of PALC actions against Harvard ownership of Gulf stock.  We support truly massive and disruptive civil disobedience along the lines of Mayday 1971, actions which can raise the domestic costs of the war yet which are more organized and disciplined than trashing.</span></p> <p><span>But we hold that it also is important to broaden the issues raised by the anti-war movement to include attacks on corporate involvement, colonialism in South Africa, and Harvard complicity.  Anti-war activity at Harvard must include visible informational picketing in the Yard and at all Harvard functions.  The time has come to build a sustained movement against imperialism where we can be most effective:  at Harvard, because that is where we work and study, where we really have the power to effect social change.\u00a0\u00a0<b>Frank Ackerman</b>\u00a0\u00a0<b>Leslie Flahbein</b></span></p> <p><span><b>(Two of the \"editorials\" referred to--appearing April 28 and May 2--were actually signed political pieces.

{"title": "A Few Words Before I Go | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>RANSFERRING TO HARVARD might have been one of the biggest mistakes of my life.  When I decided I had had enough of \"nigger, know your place\" academics and football at Drake University in Iowa, I foolishly thought that it might be possible for me to escape it by fleeing East.  East where the \"good\" white people were.  Now Harvard has proved to me what I had really feared all along:  there are very few \"good\" white people and they are not to be found all in one location.  Of course, some whites are more outwardly pleasant than others to black people, but I judge a man by his actions, not his appearance.  I could care less if his smile is wide or if he's in the habit of regularly saying \"hello\".</span></p> <p><span>I want to talk mainly about my athletic career at Harvard and why nobody knows my name here.  Before I came to Harvard.  I played in a much tougher football conference than the Ivy League--the Missouri Valley conference.  I was considered to be a \"great\" football player.  Local newspapers reflected this notion.  In The Des Moines Register and Tribune of Sept. 5, 1966, Jack Wallace, the head coach at Drake said:</span></p> <p><span>Sept. 5, 1966.  \"Future Great\" \"Williams is described by Wallace as a \"future great.\"  The head coach said that the frosh halfback played only one year of prep ball but has great potential because of his speed and size.\"</span></p> <p><span>March 18, 1967 \"Sidney Williams, a 205-pound freshman halfback from Chicago, has blossomed beyond expectations and Wallace said he could develop into an outstanding ball carrier.</span></p> <p><span>April 5, 1967 \"Williams--a real zipper--with 175 yards on the ground was the top rusher for the Bulldog offense.\"</span></p> <p><span>Sept. 15, 1967 \"...a formidable running back, Sid Williams.  'We knew next to nothing about Sid as a football player', said Jack.  'I found out he had played only one season for Hyde Park in Chicago.  It's a big school, but it plays in a minor conference, and it doesn't take game films.\"</span></p> <p><span>'But here was a big, strong young man, and I found he could run pretty fast, could high jump 6 feet, and that he was second in the city in the triple-jump.  That made him a football prospect in my book.'</span></p> <p><span>'Sid's one high school season had been in the single-wing--taking a direct snap from center,' said Wallace.  'But he really developed in spring practice and he's been even batter in our fall workouts.  He has a chance to become one of the best running backs anywhere.'</span></p> <p><span>The 6-foot, 210-pound Williams is last but,' says Wallace, 'not tremendously so.  His moves and his strength are what make him a fine runner.\"</span></p> <p><span>Oct. 1.  1967 \"Wallace calls Williams one of the hardest runners he has ever had at Drake...'Sid has shown he can run very hard and we're working him overtime this week to get him ready for Northwest Missouri, coach Jack Wallace explained Sunday.\"</span></p> <p><span>So it's clear that before I came to Harvard, many persons considered me to be a \"formidable\" football player.  In fact, throughout my high school and Drake career I was always regarded as an exceptional athlete.  Until I came to Harvard.  I had always been a first-string player.</span></p> <p><span>But why did I come to Harvard?  Why did I leave a situation where I had established myself as the \"super nigger\" of the Drake backfield.  Why?  The answer could possibly be found in the same reasons why blacks left the South and came North.  North where they felt they could finally be free men.</span></p> <p><span>My answer is I just grew tired at Drake--tired of white coaches calling me \"boy\" when I told them my name was Williams or even Sidney.  Tired of white coaches calling me \"colored\" after I repeatedly informed them that I would appreciate being called \"black\".  Tired of white coaches telling me what I should major in, what courses to get in and what I should do if I wanted to graduate.  Tired of white coaches telling me how I should dress and wear my hair and who I should associate with.  Tired of white professors who would not dare to go into a black ghetto without a police escort, telling me why black people acted the way they did and what should be done to make them \"Normal Americans\".  Tired of flakey white students who worshipped me as a \"colored\" athlete but never respected me as a black man.</span></p> <p><span>Just as the black man came North in search of a promised land where he could be a man, so did I come to Harvard.  I came to Harvard because I had had enough of the bad white people out at Drake.  I wanted to go where the good white people were--the land of Garrison and Beecher Stowe.  Where Fred Douglass escaped.  Where Crispus Attucks thought life was good enough to sacrifice his life for Independence.  To the school that educated DuBois and Trotter.  Yes, I came to this land and its \"greatest liberal institution\".  I came because I thought I could be a free man here, at least have more freedom that I was allotted at Drake.  Nobody would stand in my way in my quest to be a free and total man.  But just as so many blacks found when they came North that there is no sanctuary or preserve in this country where a black man can be free, where he can be himself and still be respected and honored for being so, I found that also is true at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>At Drake, I was shackled by a typical grant-in-aid athletic scholarship, a stagnant academic environment and a stifled social life.  I came to Harvard--as most students do--primarily for personal advancement.  First I wanted to equip my mind so that one day I might become an anthropological authority.  I thought a Harvard degree would enhance my credibility in this pursuit.  Now I feel it might have the opposite effect.  Additionally, I came to continue my gridiron \"super nigger\" exploits.</span></p> <p><span>Academically, I have done well.  After my first semester's academic shellacking.  I quickly found out that for the sake of grades I had a prescribed role to play in this institution.  I would have to always give teachers what they wanted, and rarely what I truly believed, for my beliefs were usually in conflict with the professor.  In classes taught by whites, like Pettigrew's class on Race Relations.  I returned my thinking to 1962 and wrote as I thought Martin Luther King would have because I knew that that was what Pettigrew wanted.  For most of the Afro-American courses I have taken I assumed the rhetorical style of H. Rap Brown.</span></p> <p><span>I am not proud of my self-demeaning, two-faced accomplishments, but this behavior is just a microcosm of the group behavior the black man is relegated to in this society.  For I am neither Martin Luther King nor H. Rap Brown.  I don't think every white man is a devil, nor do I think every black man is an angel.  I wasn't raised to think either way, nor has my life led me to believe otherwise.  If that makes me \"a Tom\", so be it.  If it makes me a black militant.  I guess I'm one.  I am convinced that the real me could not have made it through Harvard.  The only courses at Harvard in which I could unmask my true feelings without fear of grade reprisals were scattered through the Anthropology Department.</span></p> <p><span>Athletically, I had only unfortunate experiences at Harvard.  One was meeting Coach John Yovicsin and his football staff, who successfully foiled any aspirations I had for gridiron achievement.  Yovicsin and his staff could best be described as typically racist, reactionary conservatives--the kind of Americans who elected Richard Nixon in 1968.  The following selected passages might provide more insight into \"Yovy\" and his relationship to me during the 1970 football season:  Dartmouth Program Oct. 24, 1970 \"It didn't seem inappropriate at his first press conference at a Boston hotel.  Down at the end of a table was a long-hair, a beatnik with bushy hair and thick glasses--a stereotype.  Yovicsin merely glanced at him.</span></p> <p><span>\"Tom Bolles, the athletic director, with a whimsical turn of mind, said to Yovicsin:  'That's one of your ends.'</span></p> <p><span>\"Yovicsin recalls, 'I almost fell out of my chair.'</span></p> <p><span>\"Of course, he wasn't a football player at all--just a writer from The Crimson.\"</span></p> <p><span>'I have loved my years at Harvard.' says Yovicsin.  'I love Harvard more than Dick Harlow said I would.  That zoo parade up in Harvard Square these days, that's not Harvard.  The real Harvard is in the college, in the classrooms.'\"</span></p> <p><span>News and Views of Harvard Sports Dec. 1. 1970\"...after beating Yale for the eighth time in his 14-year career at Harvard.  \"It takes everything a person can give to coach football, and even then you never get to the point where you feel you've done all you can.\"  Yovicsin said the 14-12 victory over Yale was more important to his players than it was to him.</span></p> <p><span>\"...a Yale scout once wrote in his report:  'Harvard is a team that can be depended upon to play the percentages.'  Now his critics said:  Well, he's too aloof; he doesn't get close enough to the players.  He wins because he has good material.'</span></p> <p><span>'I couldn't be over-friendly with an individual or a group, say from the same House.  I couldn't face the charge of favoritism.' he says.  'I couldn't let my hair down.  There are two sides to the job, the nature of the man and the nature of the job.'</span></p> <p><span>\"Yovicsin's career at Harvard, from time to time, has been clouded by drop-outs.  'Sure, they bothered me,' he says.  'I tried to convince them they were making a mistake.  I talked with them the way I'd talk to my sons.  I asked them to seek other advice--from people outside football--and to add everything up.  Sometimes, truthfully, you're better off when some of them quit.'</span></p> <p><span>\"Above all he has been honest.  An honest coach, an honest man.  That virtue is always its own reward.\"</span></p> <p><span>Rutgers Football Program October 3, 1970 'But we have found senior leadership this year.  These are the same fellows who were sophomores in 1968, and they remember that, too.'</span></p> <p><span>'I'm more happy for the boys than anyone else...expecially the seniors,' he said.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Yovicsin pinned his hopes on \"a great senior class.'</span></p> <p><span><b>U</b>PON TRANSFERRING TO HARVARD in the fall of 1969, I went to visit \"Honest Yovy\" to tell him that I wanted to play football for Harvard.  I showed Yovicsin my scrapbook from Drake to let him know that I was a football \"super nigger\".  He asked me why I left Drake.  I told him that I had had racial difficulties at Drake--that the coaches disapproved of my politics, heard and dress.  Yovicsin assured me I would have no such difficulties of that nature at Harvard.  Then he proceeded to tell me \"some of my best friends are colored\".</span></p> <p><span>Yovicsin told me that he \"even\" had a \"colored friend who was a psychiatrist\", and that during his athletic career he had played on many teams with \"colored boys\".  At Harvard, he said, some of his best players had been \"colored boys\".  He then told me how he was sure I would like Harvard football and attending the school.  After Yovicsin finished telling me about his \"colored boys\" and \"colored friends\" I asked him if it would be possible for me to meet the other coaches.  He said it would, and directed me to the other side of the IAB where his assistant coaches had their offices.</span></p> <p><span>The first coach I met was Jimmy Feula.  Jimmy's scalp-revealing crewcut and voice reminded me of Gomer Pyle's sergeant.  This was understandable, however; as I later found out.  Feula had had a long Army career.  After nearly breaking my hand with his handshake and a few minutes of small talk.  Jimmy too asked me why I had left Drake.  I repeated much of what I had previously said to Yovicsin.  Then Feula told me how \"fair and honest\" he was and how he had had \"many great colored guys\" play for him at Harvard.  After talking with \"fair and honest\" Jimmy, I went next door to meet the backfield coach, Tommy Stephens.  Tommy also had a close crewcut, As I entered Stephen's office, he removed his feet from his desktop and stood up to shake my hand.  Tommy told me that Yovy had just called him to say I was coming over.  As he puffed on his cigar, he asked me how much I weighed, the times in which I had run the 40- and 100-yard dash, and what positions I had played.  I told him I weighed 210 pounds, had been timed at 4.7 seconds in the 40-yard dash at Drake, and had run a 9.9 hundred as a senior in high school.  I told him I had played halfback and fullback at Drake.</span></p> <p><span>Stephens had me fill out a football form which inquired about my previous athletic career and asked the questions he had already asked.  As I went about completing the form I noticed that Stephens was studying me, my clothes and the medallion around my neck.  He seemed fascinated by my appearance.</span></p> <p><span>When I handed Tommy the completed form, he asked me how I could get a football helmet on \"with that beard\".  I told him I didn't think I would have any problems.  He then looked down at my Navy surplus bellbottom trousers and asked me if I had been in the Navy.  I answered, \"no\".  Then he said, \"Well, why then do you wear those weird clothes?\"</span></p> <p><span>I told Stephens that I was sorry he didn't like my clothes, but that I liked them and they were all that I could afford.  I told him that if he had an aversion to what I was wearing.  I would gladly go with him to J. Press or Saks Fifth Avenue--which were nearby--and wear anything he bought for me.  Tommy asked me if I was \"some kind of a wise guy\".  I said that I wasn't, but that I didn't think looks had anything to do with the way a man played football.  Stephens replied.  \"Here in the Ivy League we like our players to be cleancut and respectable.\"</span></p> <p><span>Leaving Stephens's office I began to walk down the hallway and passed a red, white and blue sign on a door which read.  \"America, love it or leave it\".  As I left the IAB I questioned if coming to Harvard had been the right move.  I wondered if I had escaped anything at all.</span></p> <p><span><b>D</b>URING THE YEAR I met the rest of \"Fair Harvard's\" coaching staff and found them all to be of a similar nature to Yovicsin, Feula and Stephens.  In the spring.  I reported for Harvard's day of football where the newcomers to the Varsity are timed, and run through drills.  I ran a 4.8 in the 40-yard dash.  The other halfback prospects--Ted DeMars and Richie Gatto--ran the same time for the 40.  But at 210 pounds I was larger than both, outweighing DeMars by 15 pounds and Gatto by 35 pounds.  I was pleased with my time because I had been away from football for three years and was not in the playing condition I had planned to be in the following fall.  The only thing that gave me cause for concern was the obvious difference in the way the coaches were favoring the white players as opposed to the blacks.  Attention seemed to be focused on Gatto, DeMars and Eric Crone in particular.  Black players like Rod Foster, Bill Craven, and myself seemed to receive little notice, and in many cases, blacks were totally overlooked.</span></p> <p><span>Before I left for summer vacation in 1970.  Ralph Jelic, the defensive coach who was the only coach who had spoken to me regularly during the year, asked me \"what was going to happen in Chicago over the summer\".  I asked him what he meant.  He said, \"You know.  Do you think there's going to be any trouble?\"  I asked him what he meant by trouble.  He replied.  \"Are there going to be any riots or demonstrations?\"  I told him I didn't know.  Then he said, \"Well, if there in, I hope they let the police and the National Guard use their bullets and beyonets.\"  I went home wondering what horrors lay in store for me in my upcoming season of Harvard football.</span></p> <p><span>When I returned in the fall for football camp, I found myself as a fifth-string halfback.  I was not surprised.  I expected to be there because I had not played at Harvard and it wouldn't have been fair to place me above players who had proved themselves here.  Still I knew that physically I had shown just as much, if not more, than the other new candidates at the halfback position.</span></p> <p><span>Pete Varney, the huge All-Ivy tight end, was at the first string halfback position.  Watching Varney going through drills made me wonder why they had ever switched him from tightend to halfback, and why, being new to the position, he was automatically given a first-string position.  The coaches now more than in the spring were favoring certain white players, especially seniors.  Seeing Varney, a senior, at halfback, and watching what appeared to be a deliberate passing over of more suitable players for first-string positions.  I began to question the judgement and ability of Yovicsin and his staff.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard's football camp was incredibly lax and low-key.  It was nothing like the brutal, competitive camps I had been through at Drake and in high school.  I couldn't believe that I was preparing to play college football.  Drake's workouts were long and hard.  Everyone was out to knock the hell out of each other, and to win someone else's position.  I knew things would be easier at Harvard but not as easy as I found.  Yovicsin seemed to be running a \"gentleman's\" workout as opposed to the do-or-die competition I had come to know.  There was no way, really, to beat out a player ahead of you, and it appeared as though the coaches had structured it that way.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>TILL I KEPT TRYING and eventually moved up to a third-string halfback position.  Rod Foster and Bill Craven also moved up.  Foster was alternating with Eric Crone for the first-string quarterback position and Craven was now a third-string flanker.  Stephens, the backfield coach, continued to show no appreciation for my talents and hustle.  Many players like Tom Miller and Varney would walk through plays and rarely went all out in drills.  That would have never been tolerated from any player at Drake.  Miller and Varney felt safe doing so because it was obvious to them and to everybody else that they had the positions won from the outset of camp.</span></p> <p><span>Yovicsin, I found out, was derisively called \"YoYo\" by the players.  Both the players and coaches considered him to be the laughing stock of the camp.  One day Yovicsin called me into his office and told me that Stephens had suggested that I be moved to defensive end.  That I was the only backfield man who had the \"size, strength and agility\" to shift to that position from the backfield.  I asked Yovicsin why, if Stephens could see that I possessed these qualities, that they could not best be utilized at a halfback position.  After establishing the record I did as a halfback at Drake, I asked why was I even being considered for any other position?  And why was I not being given a sincere opportunity to beat out the other halfbacks?  I admitted that my blocking was a little off and I was having some difficulty adjusting to a new system, but I said that if I was given a fair chance to carry the ball more and learn the plays, I was sure that eventually I would prove myself to be the best halfback.</span></p> <p><span>Yovicsin didn't even pause to consider my questions.  He just told me that if I wanted to make a \"contribution to the team,\" I should move to defensive end.  Reluctantly, I agreed to do so.  Throughout the previous year.  Stephens and I had exchanged many harsh words.  I knew he hated my guts and I'm sure he knew the feeling was mutual.  I was not surprised to learn that he had been the one coach strongly recommending my removal to defense--away from him.</span></p> <p><span>My move to defense even surprised many of the defensive players.  A couple came up to me to say that they \"couldn't understand what had prompted 'YoYo to make such a decision,\" how I was the hardest offensive back to tackle.  This was something I knew all along.  I remained a fourth-string defensive end for about two days.  Then I finally told Yovicsin that I could no longer comfortably remain there when I knew that I was a better runner than any of the halfbacks he had.  Telling him my feelings made him mad.  He told me that if I moved back to offense, it would have to be as a fullback.  I agreed to do so.</span></p> <p><span>Upon re-entering the backfield.  I noticed that my arrival was not exactly her aided by my old namesis.  Tommy Stephens.  Again I was placed on the fifth string.  Again I moved up to the third string, but no higher.  I remained as a third-string fullback throughout camp.</span></p> <p><span><i>The author is a senior in Dudley House.  An injury kept him out of action during the 1971 football season.</i> and was rarely called upon to carry the ball.  Finally, in the last scrimmage against the University of New Hampshire, at New Hampshire, I was allowed to carry the ball behind the first-string line.</span></p> <p><span>In the third quarter, after the Harvard offense had been sputtering all day, Yovicsin and the offensive coaches sent all the offensive black players in after a kickoff.  Rod Foster was at quarterback.  Bill Craven at flanker, Dave Robeson at tightend, and I was at fullback.  Immediately we began to drive down the field.  Foster was pinpointing passes to Craven and Robeson, running on his own when necessary, and handing off the ball to me in tight yardage situations.</span></p> <p><span>When we got to the New Hampshire three-yard-line.  Foster gave me the ball and I took it over for a touchdown.  It was the first sustained drive Harvard had waged that day.  One would have thought the coaches would be pleased with our performance and the touchdown.  Returning to the sidelines, we received many congratulations from the players, but the coaches acted almost as if nothing had happened.  They seemed to resent the fact that we had scored.  Stephens said nothing to me.  Finally Yovicsin forcingly said \"good show\".</span></p> <p><span>Little did I know that that was the last chance I would be given to prove myself with the first-string offense.  When it appeared evident that Foster had won the first-string quarterback role.  Yovicsin began to act as if he had paid his debt to the cause of Harvard race relations.  Now, how could he be anything but fair when he had a \"colored boy\" at the glory position calling all the shots.</span></p> <p><span>Before the first game of the season against Northeastern, a black reporter, Joe Fisher, a writer for the Baltimore Afro-American, observed a practice session.  Afterwards, he came up to me and said that he thought I was \"the hardest runner on the team\".  Later I learned that Fisher, the only black sports reporter covering Harvard football throughout the season, asked Yovicsin in the weekly post-game coaches conference.  \"Why isn't Sid Williams playing?\"  After a while Yovicsin would just laugh it off, saying \"Williams doesn't know our system\" or that \"we have so many good backs\".</span></p> <p><span>Against Northeastern, in the final minutes of the game.  I ran for a touchdown which was called back.  I carried the ball twice behind the blocking of the second-string line for a 7.5-yard average.  It was the first and last opportunity I had to carry the ball in a varsity game for Harvard.  I stayed as a third-string fullback throughout the duration of the 1970 season and was relegated to junior varsity football.  During the season I constantly protested to Yovicsin, the coaching staff, the administration of the University and anyone else who would listen, for a fair chance to play varsity football.  It was a chance that never came.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HOUGH I HAD MANY outstanding junior varsity games, and was frequently the leading rusher.  I finally quit the team after gaining 180 yards against Princeton.  I had seen players like DeMars and Crone advance to starting positions on the varsity, but I remained a lowly junior varsity, but I remained a lowly junior varsity player.  From week to week.  I would go in and ask the coaches why I was not being moved up to the varsity.  They gave me every reason in the world but the truth.  On different occasions, Stephens would tell me varying reasons why I was not advancing.  First it was because I \"didn't know the offense\".  Next time I was \"stonefingered\".  Then I was \"musclebound\".  Stephens told me he didn't like the way I carried the ball in the palm of my hand.  Finally he claimed I didn't hustle and didn't have a \"proper attitude\".</span></p> <p><span>Sometimes Stephens would forget what he had told me at our previous meetings and would pause to fabricate a new excuse.  Once I asked the defensive coach.  Ralph Jelic, why he thought I wasn't playing on the varsity, Jelic replied.  \"Because you don't lift your feet high enough off the ground when you run.\"  Which told me that either Jelic knew nothing about running backs or that there was a conspiracy afoot to discredit my abilities.  Football authorities do not share Jelic's opinion about my style of running.  Paul Zimmerman, in his book A Thinking Man's Guide to Pro Football, says.  \"Some qualities seem universal.  The great ones usually run with their feet close to the ground--Sayers, Jimmy Brown, Jimmy Taylor, Joe Perry--they all did.  Even Lenny Moore, who was noted for his high knee action brought his feet down when he got near the line.  The reason is balance.\"</span></p> <p><span>Countless times I pleaded with Yovicsin to let me play a quarter, or even five minutes, in a varsity game and carry the ball.  I asked him to match me against the fullbacks in front of me in competitive drills.  I suggested having each of is run at Gary Farnetti, then Harvard's premiere defensive player.  Yovicsin refused all my requests, telling me \"that isn't the Harvard way.\"  He said he had made his \"final decision\" on the starting lineup.</span></p> <p><span>There are some coaches who would not have agreed with Yovicsin's procedure.  Joe Paterno, in his book Football My Way, discusses how many coaches would handle such a situation:  \"Alabama's Bear Bryant and Jim Owens of the University of Washington are of the hard-nosed school.  They use what they call the 'challenge' system to stimulate competition.  At Washington, for instance, if a second-teamer thinks he is better than the player ranked ahead of him by the coaches, he can challenge him to a contest.  Usually it is brutal, sometimes bloody, one-on-one block and tackle combat.  If the challenger beats his man, he gets the first-team job.\"  This is the way it was done at Drake.</span></p> <p><span>Paterno goes on to say.  \"All I want them to do is to pull up their pants, look the other guy in the eye and say.  Let's go.  Let's find out which of us is the better man'.  I tell them either they can do it or they can't.  What's the sense of worrying about it.  Give it your best and if you can't do it, why you can't.  If the other guy is better, then he should win.\"  I guess many would say that this isn't the Ivy League, gentlemen's way of doing things.  Perhaps the same could be said of equal treatment.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE ONLY GOOD THING that came of Harvard football for me was when the players and a couple of the trainers came up to me and told me that they felt I had been wronged during the season and merited an honest shot at the varsity.  At the final football banquet.  Chuck Krohn--sitting at a table away from me--got up and said loudly to some old Harvard Alums sitting with him:  \"You want to know who the best back on the team is?  He's Sidney Williams, that black guy sitting over there.  And you know what?  They wouldn't even let him play, but boy is he tough.\"  When I heard Krohn, a Harvard halfback say this.  I knew then that though I might not have impressed Yovicsin and his racist coaches, in the eyes of some of the players I had proven myself.  And to me that is what the game is all about</span></p>"}

{"title": "Standing Up for America | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b>S PART OF last week's strike activity, one hundred antiwar demonstrators staged a sit-in at the Cambridge Draft Board.  As we sat crammed in the narrow corridor, chanting, singing and clapping, Mayor Barbara Ackermann appeared, brandishing three letters.  She told us and the ubiquitous television cameras that she had received the letters from Cambridge residents who were irate at the antics of college students.  She chided us for being boisterous, telling us we needed to \"reach people like these\" and that we would only further alienate them by our behavior.  She circulated the letters, and some of the people sitting-in chuckled over the misspelt insults.</span></p> <p><span>Simultaneously in Washington, Richard Nixon entertained the opinions of a few advisers and two days later told a national television audience that he was going to continue bombing the North, again initiate \"serious\" talks in Paris, and withdraw more American ground troops.  Like all of America's actions in Southeast Asia during the two-decade involvement there, the moves were made by executive decree.</span></p> <p><span>The time has long past when a substantial number of Americans supported American involvement in Indochina and the time never existed when our people were consulted by or even informed of our government's actions there.  Troops are sent or withdrawn, bombs are dropped, puppet governments are overthrown or propped up, over one million people are murdered:  all without the advice or consent of the American people.  A little group of men in the White House and the Pentagon sit behind mahogany desks and decree who shall live and who shall die.</span></p> <p><span><b>R</b>ADICALS HAVE traditionally, and accurately, pointed to the economic dynamics of American and world capitalism as being the prime movers behind an expansionist foreign policy.  But to say that a nation dominated by GM and ITT exists in an atmosphere where those in power believe the international expansion of American business to be consonant with the wellbeing of all Americans is very different from claiming that the presidents of those corporate giants have an active role in deciding America's day-to-day foreign policy.  We face in the realm of foreign policy--especially in the Southeast Asian nightmare--a primacy of politicians:  many businessmen would profit by an end to the war and a return to exploitative normalcy.  One can correctly point to offshore oil interests in the South China sea as an underlying economic dynamic, but almost no one would seriously believe that the oil lobby is keeping us in Southeast Asia.  To be sure, the American corporate state created Richard Nixon, but the monster has been set loose:  he and his tiny coterie of advisors, and they alone, are responsible for the continued insanity.  And although they might in fact defer on occasion to the corporate princes, they are deaf to the opinions of the American people.</span></p> <p><span>And as the pilots continue to hurtle their F4A's and B-52s into the air, their targets known only to them as a set of map coordinates, they kill by proxy for Nixon and Kissinger, and not for us or for the people who wrote the letters to Mayor Ackermann.  We, along with the letter writers and the majority of dovish Americans, share with the people of Indochina the same powerless relationship to the American government.  In our protests we have tried to make this clear.  We find the notion of lobbying our supposed representatives in Washington laughable, for they are almost as powerless as we:  the Gulf of Tonkin resolution--passed under fake pretenses--was repealed last year and the illegal war continues.  We have tried to focus our protest on Nixon and him alone; we have disrupted and will continue to disrupt targets linked to the Federal government because we are trying to send Richard Nixon a message; we are saying that if you do not listen we will make you listen, that you cannot kill in Indochina without filling the streets at home.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HUS FAR, our success has been limited.  Calisthenics on the moon last week blacked out embittered protest at home.  But we must not give up; the arrogance of the President's television message must be matched by the escalation of our outrage.  But our message needs to be clarified!  We are certainly not trying to tell the people of America what they already know; we are not even attempting to pressure the men who make the bombs, for incongruous as it seems, in the immediate future they are also powerless.  We are talking to Nixon and we are in a state of emergency:  Indochinese are being dismembered and burned and we must try to stop it.</span></p> <p><span>It is disheartening but chillingly possible that we may fail.  This horrible but real possibility cannot absolve us of the responsibility to act, for even in the face of defeat, we retain an important function:  we must bear witness for the people of America.  We must say that the death from the skies over Hanoi and Laos does not emanate from Nebraska and Detroit:  that the mountain people in Appalachia do not hate the mountain people in the Central Highlands; that the Nixons and the Kissingers do not represent America but pervert it.  That must continue to be our task as students; we who can disrupt our routines with ease must act for those who are constrained by a nine-to-five system.  We can deal with the makers of bombs and the designers of contingency plans later:  for now, we must say to the people of the world that this is not our war, it is not the American people's war, it is Richard Nixon's war, and he is our enemy as he is yours.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Conventional Wisdom Fails Again | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>F</b>OR THE PAST several months, the conventional wisdom among reputedly knowledgeable political columnists has been that Senator George McGovern probably won't win the Democratic nomination for President because he is unacceptable to the big city and labor leaders who form the nucleus of traditional Democratic party power.  Columnists like Rowland Evans and Robert Novak, Stewart Alsop, and James Reston have consistently passed along the information that Democratic powers like Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and AFL-CIO President George Meany cannot support McGovern's candidacy.  They have, however, rarely been able to quote sources to back up their claims.</span></p> <p><span>A spot check with several labor and party officials last week revealed that the conventional wisdom may once again prove wrong.</span></p> <p><span>In Chicago, Mike Neigoff, a spokesman for Mayor Daley, said Friday that \"no one has ever quoted Mayor Daley saying whom he supports or doesn't support.  At the convention, the Illinois delegation will caucus and hear from anyone who wants to speak to them and then determine who to support.\"  This isn't saying much but it's far from proclaiming McGovern's unacceptability.</span></p> <p><span>In Washington, Albert J. Zack, the Director of Public Relations for the AFL-CIO and a spokesman for George Meany, said Friday that the nation's largest labor organization is taking no position \"except that we are absolutely opposed to George Wallace and we will fight him.\"  Zack added that Meany himself will be \"neutral until after both conventions.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>IMILARLY, the United Auto Workers Union finds McGovern far from odious.  An article in the Detroit Free Press last Friday reported that United Auto Workers Vice President Olga Madar recently spoke in McGovern's behalf at a reception for Victor Reuther, retired UAW official and backer of the Senator.  She said that UAW Vice Presidents Douglas Fraser and Irving Bluestone and Secretary-Treasurer Emil Mazey \"will be in there actively compaigning\" for McGovern.</span></p> <p><span>Joseph Crangle, chairman of the Democratic Party in New York State, is staying neutral in the Presidential race until after the Empire State's June 20th Primary.  He feels, however, that McGovern would have \"no problem in getting support from the so-called regular organization.\"  Of the assumption that McGovern could not get regular support, he said.  \"It seems to be a premise fostered by people who aren't entranced with McGovern's candidacy.\"  Crangle added that \"feelings are not the same in 1972 as they were in 1968. McGovern doesn't cause people to feel short.  He's not an individual they <i>(the regulars)</i> feel they cannot work with.\"  And in Philadelphia, a spokesman for Philadelphia Democratic leader Peter J. Camiel, who supported Muskie, said Friday that \"every candidate is acceptable.\"  What the \"establishment\" columnists don't mention (and should and probably do realize) is that organization politicians aren't particularly concerned with ideology.  Their main concern is with winning, and if McGovern looks like a winner, they'll support him.</span></p> <p><span>Regular Democrats like Matthew Troy, Queens Democratic County Leader in New York City; Sebastian Leone, Borough President of Brooklyn and a confidante of Brooklyn County Leader Meade Esposito; and Arthur Barbieri, chairman of the Democratic organization in New Haven, are all supporting McGovern.  They are doing so for their own reasons, which frequently have a lot to do with party infighting in their own areas.  But the very fact that they have gone with the Prairie Senator contradicts the thesis of the establishment columnists.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>F COURSE, the experience of the Muskie campaign shows that these party leaders cannot always produce votes to go with their endorsements, and no one is claiming that neutral leaders like Daley and Meany will not support McGovern at the convention.  The point is that McGovern is certainly not anathema to party leaders, as some columnists claim.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe the inside dopesters have contacts the rest of us don't.  Maybe they know more about what Mayor Daley is thinking than we do.  No one can judge that.  What we all can judge is their record:  the prediction of a centrist \"Real Majority,\" the dismissal of McGovern as \"not a serious candidate,\" and the claim that Muskie was unstoppable as long as he didn't move too far left.  Looking at these things, and at the evidence piling up against their latest reports of McGovern's unacceptability to Democratic regulars, one begins to suspect that the knowledgeable columnists are not so knowledgeable after all; that they are not so much reporters of fact as they are voices for conservative Democratic hopes.</span></p>"}

It all comes from the fact that the government is supported by the Americans.  Not many people.  From the day the Americans withdraw their support...that day, the Vietnamese people will be able to decide on our fate and the role of the minority of people who actually rule the country, they will collapse by itself because it has no people support.</i></span></p> <p><span><i>I don't think that any government that has no support from its own people would be able to stand.  Even supported by foreign powers such as America--this is a lesson that we have learned for the last 10 years.

But unfortunately for this time of the human rebuild-up we are converging towards a new world and I think the new equilibrium has not been found yet.  That's why we haven't been able so far to find our real wise solution, but in fact there are some basic rules.  As long as every nation would recognize to every other nation with the same rights asked by themselves--the right to hold their own business--as long as every human being would be recognized--any basic right as human beings--as long as no other country would want to impose on other people their way of living, their way of governing themselves--of course, peace would come--peace would last and there would be real cooperation, on equal footing respect of mutual sovereignty.</i></span></p> <p><span><i>And I am happy that President Nixon has now recognized that and recently tried to approach Communist China in order to work for peaceful co-existence.

{"title": "Dusk at Paris | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b> NEW ROUND of secret talks between the United States and North Vietnam will begin very soon in Paris.  The continued offensive by North Vietnamese and PRG forces in South Vietnam as well as President Nixon's determination to defeat that offensive by all the conventional military means available does not augur well for the renewed negotiations.</span></p> <p><span>The last round of secret negotiations which ended without agreement in November 1971 may help provide some insight on the present military and diplomatic dilemma.</span></p> <p><span>On April 26, President Nixon told the nation that after the U.S. presented its eight point plan to Hanoi on October 11 of last year:</span></p> <p><span>...Hanoi's answer to this offer was a refusal even to discuss our proposals and, at the same time, a massive escalation of their military activities on the battlefield.  Last October, the same month when we made this peace offer to Hanoi in secret, our intelligence reports began to indicate that the enemy was building up for a major attack.  Yet we deliberately refrained from responding militarily.  Instead we patiently continued with the Paris talks....</span></p> <p><span>President Nixon's statement may lead the reader to believe that last October the North Vietnamese were perfidiously sabotaging the President's plans for a negotiated settlement in favor of their own military goals.  It is thus instructive to consider what President Nixon said at a news conference last November 12 concerning the \"most recent trend towards the infiltration by the enemy\":</span></p> <p><span>...The infiltration rate has come up some as it always does at this time of year.  However, it is not as high now just as the casualties are not as high now and the level of enemy activity (Ed. is not as high as it was last year.  We want to see, however, what the situation is in December and January....</span></p> <p><span>As of November 12, it would therefore appear that the rate of infiltration was not as high as it had been in 1970.  And yet, on November 17 the French paper Le Monde reported that five U.S. aircraft carriers were cruising along the Vietnamese coast and that there was a great deal of activity at U.S. air bases in Thailand.  Le Figaro of the same day reported that the North Vietnamese were strengthening their air defenses in the event of attacks by B-52s.</span></p> <p><span>In relation to the use of air power.  President Nixon said on November 12:</span></p> <p><span>As we reduce the number of our forces, it is particularly important for us to continue our air strikes on the infiltration routes.  If we see any substantial step-up in infiltration in the passes, for example, which lead from North Vietnam into Laos and, of course, the Laotian trail which comes down through Cambodia into South Vietnam--if we see that, we will have to not only continue our air strikes; we will have to step them up.</span></p> <p><span>Could it be that through excessive concentration of air power in the Indochina area during a period when by his own admission North Vietnamese infiltration had not even reached the comparable level for the previous year, President Nixon convinced the leaders in Hanoi that the U.S. did not really want to negotiate?</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE ANSWER to the above question is as yet unclear.  Perhaps a chronological summary of what happened between October 11 and November 22 will shed some light on the reasons that the last round of secret negotiations did not succeed.</span></p> <p><span>* <i>October 11:</i>  The U.S. delivered to North Vietnam an eight point proposal which \"goes to the limits of possible generosity\" and \"does not join the enemy to overthrow our ally.\"  The exact content of the plan is unclear, but the U.S. did call for secret negotiations in Paris on November 1 to discuss it.</span></p> <p><span>On the same day in a dispatch from Moscow in the London Evening News Soviet agent Victor Louis stated, \"A negotiated end to the Vietnam war appears to be in sight.  All the indications are that, with Russia and the United States finding a common interest over the conflict, a race for peace has begun.\"</span></p> <p><span>* <i>October 22:</i>  The South Vietnamese Embassy in Paris published a call for a step up in the Phoenix campaign.  In order to gain a \"lasting peace,\" all of the PRG soldiers and cadres infiltrated among the populace would have to be wiped out, the article said.</span></p> <p><span>* <i>October 25:</i>  North Vietnam sent a message to the U.S. in which it said that Le Duc Tho would be coming to Paris for secret talks on November 20 rather than November 1.</span></p> <p><span>* <i>October 26:</i>  In an interview with L'Aurore.  President Thieu of South Vietnam called for the formation of a united \"loyal opposition\" among rival factions in his country.  He also discussed the need to form a strong majority party which would prepare the public for new government programs and which would keep the legislative and executive branches in touch with each other.  Thieu's new ruling party would avoid the excesses committed by Ngo Dinh Diem's party.</span></p> <p><span>Thieu commented that his government and people had successfully completed the purely military phase of the war.  He said that 1971 was a year of transition which had allowed consolidation of gains and improvement of the well-being of the citizenry.  The war--in going away from the most productive rice growing areas in the countryside and from the large urban centers toward \"fall-back\" zones in remote areas--had now become a strictly military affair.</span></p> <p><span>* <i>October 28:</i>  According to Philip Warden of the Chicago Tribune, \"Members of the Senate were told (on October 27) that the Army's Fitzsimmons General Hospital in Denver has been alerted to handle 200 prisoners of war from Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Senators were told that when President Nixon makes his report to the nation on Viet Nam on November 15, all end-the-war proposals of Congress will be obsolete.\"</span></p> <p><span>On the same day, the PRG negotiator at Paris claimed that Saigon was beginning to relocate civilians from Quang Tri Province in the northernmost part of South Vietnam to areas of the southern part.</span></p> <p><span>* <i>November 2:</i>  The North Vietnamese Worker's Party paper Nhan Dan reported that the U.S. Senate's defeat of the foreign aid bill was \"an indelible brand on Nixon's tenure.\"  Congress later passed the bill.</span></p> <p><span>* <i>November 16:</i>  The London Times carried a report from Hanoi which quoted an article in Thong Nhat (Reunification) in which one of the editors answered a reader's question as to whether \"Nixon will succeed in imposing his conditions for withdrawal\" through his \"sensational moves\" toward Peking and Moscow.  The editor said, \"I am convinced that very shortly other moves on the military and diplomatic fronts will help you find a better answer to questions of the moment.\"</span></p> <p><span>Le Monde from Paris on the same day carried an Agence France Presse report from Hanoi which said that Minister Xuan Thuy had returned to Paris and that special envoy and Politburo member Le Duc Tho would also arrive there probably by the end of November.</span></p> <p><span>* <i>November 17:</i>  Le Monde reported that a source close to the North Vietnamese delegation in Paris had stated that there was as yet no information which would allow him to foresee a visit to Paris by Le Duc Tho soon.</span></p> <p><span>On the same day, North Vietnam sent a message to the U.S. which stated that for health reasons Le Duc Tho would not be coming to Paris, but that Minister Xuan Thuy would willingly meet with Dr. Kissinger on November 20.</span></p> <p><span>* <i>November 19:</i>  Washington sent a note to Hanoi which pointed out that Dr. Kissinger would only meet with Minister Thuy if Thuy was accompanied by some other member of the North Vietnamese political leadership.</span></p> <p><span>* <i>November 22:</i>  In an editorial sent to press on November 20, the Vietnam Courier from Hanoi reported editorially that President Nixon was determined to put off a determination of a final date for troop withdrawal as long as possible; the article said that he intended to maintain a residual force in Vietnam, to step up the air war in Indochina, and that he refused to terminate \"the bloody 'pacification' operations of the 'Phoenix' type, licked into shape by the Americans.\"</span></p> <p><span>Concerning U.S. strategy to maintain Thieu in office, the Vietnam Courier said that Nixon \"wants to prosecute <i>(in South Vietnam)</i> a kind of war of attrition in which the patience and strength of the South Vietnamese patriots would experience a hard trial whereas the affluent U.S., which has only greenbacks to lose--though less than previously--will be able to hold out indefinitely and come out victorious at long last.\"</span></p> <p><span>Intertwined in the events between October 11 and November 22 are many themes.  The role of the Russians and the Chinese in the secret negotiations between the U.S. and North Vietnam is as yet unclear.  Nor are Saigon's motives readily apparent for accelerating the Phoenix program and for relocation of civilians at such a disadvantageous time for the secret negotiations.  Who encouraged false optimism among the Senators on the prisoner of war issue and why?  Why was the Le Duc Tho trip to Paris cancelled the day after Agence France Presse reported it was to take place?  The questions that could be asked are innumerable....</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>NE OF THE problems that will complicate the new round of secret negotiations in Paris is the unwillingness of the U.S.--as expressed by President Nixon on April 26--to discuss as the first order of business anything other than the questions of an end to the \"North Vietnamese invasion\" and the return of American prisoners of war.  Clearly, for the secret negotiations to succeed a wide range of political and military matters will have to be discussed.  The talks will be complicated and prolonged, and their chances for success are dubious.</span></p> <p><span>It is no longer realistic for either party to maintain that it has \"key goals\" which must be discussed to the exclusion of other goals.  Last year, one of President Nixon's \"key goals\" was to bring home U.S. prisoners of war:  however.  Nixon refused to persuade President Thieu not to run in the October election, which thereby prevented an accommodation with Hanoi on the basis of withdrawal of U.S. troops by a specific date in exchange for return of U.S. prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span>If the Vietnam war is to end by negotiation and thereby not become any more of a confrontation between the \"great powers\" than it is at present, all parties concerned will have to exercise restraint in order to make it possible to hammer out a proposal for an end of the conflict.</span></p>"}
{"title": "A Liberal Dose of Masochism | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Cambridge City Council meetings have always been volatile affairs, usually with a liberal minority hurling accusations at a conservative Mayor and his majority.</span></p> <p><span>But this year a liberal dose of masochism has made the debates even livelier.  Things were supposed to be different when the CCA-endorsed ticket won a majority of the Council seats in November and elected Barbara Ackermann as Mayor.  However, as this week's meetings demonstrate, all is not well in the liberal camp.</span></p> <p><span>A bitter feud is developing over the selection of a new City Manager, although the liberal five--Ackermann, Henry F. Owens III, Robert Moncreiff, Saundra Graham and Francis H. Duehay--made the replacement of City Manager John Corcoran the top issue of their campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Owens wants to make sure that his black candidate for the job be given equal consideration with white candidates.  But Ackermann, Duehay and Moncreiff think they have already found the best man for the job, and he is white.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, Saundra Graham is fed up with everyone:  \"All this politicking going on--if it doesn't stop, I'll resign my position.  I want a City Manager and I want him now.\"</span></p> <p><span>Early in the week, Ackermann proposed that President Nixon be billed for the recent mini-riot in Harvard Square.  Her motion, not entirely a symbolic protest, was defeated 7-1.  Outraged by this suggestion, two conservative councillors proposed a resolution calling on Ackermann to resign as Mayor.</span></p> <p><span>This motion was defeated by a vote of 4 1/2-3 1/2, with crusty Alfred Velucci straddling the issue by voting both Yes and No.  Saundra Graham was not at the meeting, so the vote wasn't as close as it appeared.</span></p> <p><span>Whether the liberals can get their house in order and stop maneuvering for political advantage is an open question.  As Moncreiff says, the problem is no longer of getting the majority of five out of nine, but of getting the five to agree on something.</span></p>"}
{"title": "THE DELUSION OF NON-COMMUNIST VIETNAM | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>To the Editors of the <b>Crimson:</b></span></p> <p><span>I had thought that there was no longer any need to set forth the nature and causes of American failure in Vietnam or the case for complete withdrawal, but the renewed bombing attacks on Hanoi and Haiphong demonstrate that there are still those who have the delusion that it will be possible to sustain a viable non-communist government in the South.  The notions of \"Vietnamization\" and an \"honorable negotiated settlement\" in Paris implied the delusion, but one could question how seriously they should be taken.  When, however, we renew massive bombing raids with their indiscriminate slaughter, it seems clear that President Nixon and his top advisors either think that the South can survive as an independent entity, or they are committed to postponing its collapse until after the election.  It if is the former, they are fools:  if the latter, the most callous sort of political opportunists.</span></p> <p><span>As a member of the infamous Michigan State University project in Vietnam from 1955-1957, I participated in that attempt to create an anti-communist regime in the South.  By 1957 it was already clear that the Diem Government was moving towards a police state to offset its declining popularity, and that the massive presence of the U.S. was undermining Diem's legitimacy and encouraging his authoritarian tendencies.  That was 15 years, 5 governments and how many dead and maimed Vietnamese ago?  Everything we have done over the past 15 years has contributed to destroying the integrity, the rationality and the will of the people in South Vietnam while building up the commitment to national reunification in the North.  We have trained a few people at the top of the South how to con us into great concern over the consequences of their defeat and therefore continuing support of their survival.  Our leaders for 15 years have operated out of fear of being held responsible for a debacle (e.g. \"who lost China\"), and the false hope that they could create a regime that could survive.</span></p> <p><span>The con artists in South Vietnam are not all venal.  Some are; but many are just trying to exist in a terribly confused setting.  What would happen to them if the North Vietnamese take over?  The more corrupt, who have already made their fortunes, would probably flee, and wisely so.  The rest would stay and try to make their peace with the new regime.  I am sure that some of them would be killed and some imprisoned, but probably not many.  There was no mass slaughter in the North in 1955 and 1956.  Most Vietnamese with strong feelings about political freedom have already left the country and those who remain have learned how to compromise.</span></p> <p><span>We have no right or reason to continue, much less to expand a completely corrupt and corrupting war either to save a few of our \"friends\" or to postpone an inevitable failure.  We should recognize that there is absolutely no hope for an independent, anti-communist regime in the South.  Given that fact, the only way we can help the Vietnamese people is to get out of the country completely--military aid, CIA, the whole works--and let the Vietnamese work out their own accomodations and solutions.</span></p> <p><span>The U.S. Governmenn by its recent actions has demonstrated that it neither accepts these propositions nor is it following a consistent policy of withdrawal.  So long as this is true and the Government remains unresponsive to the normal expressions of public opinion, there must be mass demonstrations as the only way of showing the degree of dissatisfaction with current policies.  If such demonstrations can be kept non-violent and non-destructive they can help to build popular support for stopping the war.  It is unfortunate that University buildings and research facilities become the lightning rods for absorbing the frustrations over tragic Government policies.  A more fruitful line of action is to assure that the person elected President next November is unalterably committed to stopping our involvement in the war. <b>David C.

{"title": "Meet The Press | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>C</b>ONSCIOUSNESS expanding has given way to consciousness raising has given way to self-consciousness, and the media has not been unaffected.  From the first person coming-out columns of the Village Voice to the Arts &amp; Leisure section of the Sunday Times, journalists are exhibiting the same questioning self-awareness of purpose and procedure, the resulting fall-out of the social conflict of the sixties, that has settled on so many aspects of our national life.</span></p> <p><span>Which is not the same as saying that journalism itself--journalism as embodied by the newspapers and magazines and television networks and their subsidiaries--has also embarked on a big, new beautiful tomorrow.  The advances in journalism have been made by individuals and the corporate entities have generally resisted their influence.  Probably in reflection of their history of family ownership, newspapers today are as reticent as ever in telling tales on themselves.  Why, you might ask, is the New York Times so upset by the spectre of the New Populism?  Why did the Boston Globe move columnist David Deitch off its editorial pages?  And how much would vou wager CBS's ownership of the New York Yankees figured in its coverage of the baseball players' strike?  You can speculate on the answers all you want for you are not likely to find them reported by the press itself.  (One exception you shouldn't miss is Sanford Ungar's account on the publication of the Pentagon Papers in the May issue of Esquire.)</span></p> <p><span>Embattled on one side by the calculated attacks of a paranoid Agnew (who can't recognize a friend when he has one) and on the other by leftists, feminists, and citizen's interests groups--the press can no longer afford to go on living such an unexamined life.  For a year now, (More), a journalism review which hails from New York, has been attempting to lead other, regional journalism reviews in examining the prejudices, failings and occasional accomplishments of the journalistic scene.  It's efforts, as might be expected of any innocent in the halls of corruption, have been only sporadically successfull.</span></p> <p><span>As exemplified in its May issue, (More) is best when reporting those internal press stories--like efforts by black staffers on the Washington Post to increase black representation on the paper--which the press itself would leave unreported.  (More) is least interesting when simply documenting the self-evident evils--like sexist advertising--that plague journalism.  But given that (More) can surmount its provincial perspective amid the newsmen's bars of Manhattan, it has a fair chance of leading the kind of serious self-examination that the established press should be performing on itself on a daily basis.</span></p> <p><span><b>L</b>ast week, in what was essentially a self-promoting publicity effort, (More) held in New York what it called The A.J. Liebling Counter-Convention.  Featuring panels on \"The...New...Journalism.\"  \"The Wayward Pressbus,\" \"Should There Be a Women's Page?,\" and \"Why Journalists Leave Daily Newspapers,\" the conference offered up a pantheon of journalism's superstars (Tom Wolfe, Gay Talese, David Halberstam, J. Anthony Lukas, Studs Terkel, Gloria Steinem, all the lovely people...) and understandably angered those daily journalists who claimed their own concerns underrepresented.  There were the requisite number of newspapermen's horror stories (take sexism, for example:  when Nixon announced his last batch of Supreme Court candidates, the males under consideration were profiled in the news pages of the Washington Post while the women were relegated to treatment in the Post's Style section) and the even more requisite gossip.</span></p> <p><span>But, when the bitching ended, all that had been accomplished was the painful awareness that without structural reforms journalism is not likely to change its colors.  Clearly, there is a more sophisticated reporter waiting in the wings (whether or not he is also a new journalist is a rather moot point) and he wants to cover unconventional stories as well as unconventional angles on quite conventional stories.  But how is his copy to survive the uphill obstacle course posed by copy readers, editors and publishers?  Some of the journalists present suggested that newsmen have some say in the editorial decisions of their papers; others advocated a national steering committee that would serve as a watchdog, criticizing the most blatant inadequacies of the press.  But no one yet seems to know how newly won self-awareness on the part of the reporter can be translated into anything other than the occasional fluke of a good piece.  It may be 1972, but all the news that fits, still isn't getting printed.</span></p>"}

In fact, the book is nothing less than a thorough annihilation of the concept of rationality, a \"stoic\" work in the very audicity with which it posits the insanity of normalcy.</span></p> <p><span>The novel is divided into three parts, the first of which is a third-person expository account of Comrade V.'s opprobrious persecution at the hands of a nameless fatherland.  A celebrated mathematician, by dint of his liberal political positivism, V. is incarcerated in an obscure \"large building, a few versts east of the capital.\"  Seated in his sterile cubicle V. watches a diffraction of his own life-history pass by on a computer print-out sheet which appraises us of his peculiar character.  A child mathematics prodigy, he had successfully voided people from his world-scheme by age ten, at which time he sat at his father's funeral, calculating the seating frequency of the mourners and concluding that they made up a bimodal distribution.  He thrives at the local university and his personality reaches its logical conclusion some years later when he patiently explained to his young wife and daughters, that having studied the loss of work time resulting from the marriage, and with the knowledge that \"the whole of my life work under the married condition must be less than half that of myself single...I have searched my heart carefully to assure this conclusion is not affected by emotional bias...and am asking for a divorce.\"</span></p> <p><span>V. watches his life punch past, conscious of the State's distortions.  Through his own reflections, we have a compelling portrait of a dissenting spirit, menaced by the claims of political conformity.  V. strives desparately to maintain a pose of \"lucidity,\" haunted by the certain knowledge that \"the man who directly claims to be sane is, in every case, revealed in his lunacy.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE SECOND part of the work records the personal diary of Comrade V., precisely chronicling the assault on his sense of stability and detailing his daily encounters with the only arm of the State which directly confronts him--the psychiatrist.  The war described in these harassed jottings is one of attrition, and we are privy to the unravelling of \"the fragile thread that sustains lucidity\" in V.</span></p> <p><span>The concluding section is a droll qualification of the first two.  It contains the text of the psychiatrist's report on the case--an exploration of the problem of \"schizoid monomamania\" which not only undermines the credibility of the foregoing account, but leaves in doubt the very existence of this mathematician Comrade V.  A melange of philosophic sallies, this third part of the novel features essays on the history of the stoic movement and the creation <i>cum</i> Laung of an unreal universe in response to an insane environment.  In a penetrating investigation of changing criterion of artistic excellence.  Park perceptively notes that ordinary craftsmen have forsaken objective standards of proficiency, \"in the face of the bewildering criterion of genius\"--very directly echoed by Norman Mailer's recent suggestion that the problem with this country is that everyone fancies himself a genius of one form or another.</span></p> <p><span>Sloan sees a continuity between the narrative philosophy of <i>Comrade V.,</i> and his first highly successful effort <i>War Games.</i>  That book, published in 1971, has already earned significant critical acclaim, most recently netting its young author the Ellen McPhaul Prize.  <i>War Games</i> is the tale of a quixotic young gentleman who leaves Harvard for the fields of Viet Nam to take \"the military interlude required of every complete and cultured man.\"  The bizarre ontological exploration of <i>Comrade V.</i> is thus, in a sense, an extension of the disillusionment of the protagonist of the first novel.</span></p> <p><span>The author himself entered Harvard in 1961, a self-styled intellectual prodigy (he was quite firmly convinced) from Clinton, South Carolina.  His father happens to be mayor of the town and a singularly reactionary political soul.  Sloan conceeds that his inquiries with respect to God and the implications of his non-existence might be seen in light of his struggle to come to terms with his family and regional background.</span></p> <p><span>After two and a half years at odds with what he perceived as the rigid values and structure of the University, he took a leave and did a tour of service in Viet Nam.  Thus his first fictional effort was partially autobiographical--the synthesis of his combat experience in Southeast Asia and subsequent exposure to the politics of protest upon returning to Cambridge in 1967.  According to Sloan, the nameless hero of his first book does not choose to take up the family tradition and enter politics upon his return from Viet Nam, nor does he completely eschew identification with issues of social concern.  Above all, he turns inward for significance.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N SLOANS estimation, a similar triple-aspect is present in his own nature.  He is, most superficially, an anarchist who revels in the atheistic void, confidently asserting that society has never been able to provide anyone with answers (assuming, of course, that one asks the questions) and decrying institutions as superfluous.</span></p> <p><span>Next, he is the responsible citizen, involved in the democratic process, devoting what he labels his two \"conscience\" hours a day to the presidential campaign of Senator McGovern and Dan Walker's gubernatorial campaign in Illinois.  Something can be said in defense of the system, he concedes, when one considers it as a vehicle for the orderly distribution of goods and services.</span></p> <p><span>The secretest and most potent self, he suggests, is the stoic--living and creating an evolving set of values and facing the cosmos with the resolve of Sisyphus.  Sloan states that his own growth in this direction is rooted in the work of theologican Paul Tillich, whose work <i>The Courage to Be</i> is footnoted in <i>Comrade V..</i>  He was further influenced by the writing of Borghes and the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche.  A Stoic, according to Sloan, is one who \"seeks assiduously for answers, knowing that they're not there, but hoping that he'll find them.\"</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, these three sides of the man are reflected in <i>Comrade V.</i>  The liberal idealist, of course, in the elusive character of V. himself, that would-be reformer in a state without conscience.  The anarchist holds sway over the psychiatric demolition of V.'s identity as well as any basis for rational reconstruction of the situation.  Finally, the stoic is suggested by the very concept and assembly of this creative, witty fiction, which in commendable contrast to the exiguity of much of contemporary fiction, deserves, if not demands, not only a first but a second reading.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Support the Moritorium | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>The following editorial has been endorsed by 5 Boston area colleges.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>P</b>RESIDENT NIXON told the nation last week that he is taking steps to ensure \"a real peace, not the peace of surrender\" in Vietnam.  He vowed to continue air and naval strikes directed at North Vietnam until the North Vietnamese halt what he termed \"unprovoked aggression\" against the South.  And the logical extension of his statements is that despite the veil of continued U.S. troop withdrawals from Vietnam, the Administration is prepared to fight its undeclared war, if only with deadly mechanical support weapons, until a non-communist, pro-American government can stand on its own in Saigon or until there is no more Vietnam over which to fight.</span></p> <p><span>Nixon's speech has had immediate effects at home.  The most crucial one is political:  since the speech, with a step-up in the North Vietnamese offensive and a wind-down of antiwar protest across the country, Nixon has been able to rally support in Congress for his time-worn Cold War strategies.  Suddenly there is a new wave of support for his determination that \"the respect of other nations is essential if the U.S. is to lead the way in building a world stability.\"  But this is not a question of international esteem for the United States's intervention in Vietnam:  it is a question of whether we at home will permit our government to pursue the slaughter of the Vietnamese people and the destruction of their country.</span></p> <p><span>Antiwar protests have dwindled in the past ten years.  Yet it has never been more crucial for us to show the Administration that we refuse to endorse its unprovoked aggression against the Vietnamese.  The recent attempt at a nationwide student strike had mixed success; we recognize now that at least for the present, antiwar demonstrations must take the form of specific, carefully planned mass action.  There are three such demonstrations scheduled during the next week.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>ODAY, THE Emergency National Moratorium Committee has called for a one-day nationwide moratorium against business as usual.  This is not merely a commemoration of the deaths of four students at Kent State University who were shot by National Guardsmen during the 1970 Cambodia strike.  It is a broad-based and locally-oriented action intended to give people throughout the country an opportunity to talk about the war, to picket draft boards, to hold town meetings.  Among those who are supporting the moratorium are Rep. Shirley Chisholm, Sen. Mike Gravel, NPAC and the Black Caucus.</span></p> <p><span>On May 6, the People's Coalition for Peace and Justice and NPAC have called for a mass rally at 2:30 p.m. on the Boston Common.  Among the scheduled speakers are Howard Zinn, Ngo Vinh Long and Bonnie Raitt.  And on May 8, the PCPJ is sponsoring a day of nonviolent civil disobedience at the John F. Kennedy Federal Building in Downtown Boston.  The day begins at 6:30 a.m. on the Commons; participants will then move to the JFK Building which houses, among other agencies, the local offices of the State Department, the FBI, the IRS, the Wage Freeze Board and the Immigration Service.</span></p> <p><span>These actions are our most visible way of demonstrating our disgust with Nixon's continuation of the air and sea war against North Vietnam.

{"title": "Bunting, Little & Co. | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b>RTHUR D. LITTLE, INC. the Cambridge-based research and consulting firm, has long provided radicals with a classic example of Harvard's connections with the military-industrial complex.  The company occupies a unique position by virtue of its outstanding expertise both in science and in management.  Not content with mere military contracting like ordinary companies, ADL also gives the government expert advice on how to finance those contracts.  Its military contracts in the past have included the testing of weapons effectiveness, development of anti-submarine warfare systems, and synthesis of THC--the active ingredient in marijuana--for incapacitating enemy troops.  Its clients include foreign countries, state and local governments, and businesses around the world.  It advises businesses on military contracts and investments in underdeveloped nations.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard is related to ADL not only by owning stock in the company, but also by providing at least two professors for its board of directors.  President Mary Bunting's decision to join ADL's board after her retirement from Radcliffe would seem a further example of Harvard's involvement with ADL, and through it, the military establishment.</span></p> <p><span>Not so, Bunting claims.  She is going to ADL as a private individual, not as a Harvard official, she argues.  And General James M. Gavin, chairman of the board and a fellow McGovern supporter, assured her that ADL was \"out of military contracting completely,\" she says.  Otherwise she would have \"felt quite differently\" about joining the board.</span></p> <p><span>Bunting's arguments are specious on both counts.  She cannot go to ADL as just \"Mrs. Bunting;\" like it or not, Bunting goes as former President of Radcliffe and former member of the Atomic Energy Commission.  She thus brings to ADL contacts with Harvard professors, prestige, and credibility as a socially-conscious firm.  And ADL is not \"out of military contracting completely\"; it no longer accepts government contracts for offensive weapons for use in Indochina, but the latest available figures show that ADL is still the fifth-largest military contractor in Cambridge (Harvard being fourth).</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UNTING's contributions to ADL could conceivably be outweighted by her insider's influence on behalf of such worthy causes as ending its military involvement.  But even if she were clearly and strongly committed to such a cause, it is questionable how much power she would have as one member of a board that includes a Business School professor; the presidents of Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates, Northeast Utilities, North American Management Corp., and Old Colony Trust Co.; the chairman of the board of Commonwealth Oil Refining Co., and John Hancock Life Insurance Co.; and the senior vice-president of the First National Bank of Boston.  She might have an effect, however, for General Gavin, as a McGovern supporter and the former \"dove general\" of Vietnam, could be forced into an embarrassing position if he refused to sanction an end to ADL's military involvement.  And ADL's complete withdrawal from military work would have an impact, for ADL is almost irreplaceable in combining scientific and managerial expertise.</span></p> <p><span>But Bunting is going to ADL with only the most tepid of liberal principles.  Contrary to what she told the <i>Crimson,</i> ADL does have military contracts; but she finds them unobjectionable, for they are not directly related to the war, and she thinks it necessary for this country to keep improving its defense capabilities.  ADL should not develop offensive weaponry for use in Indochina, Bunting believes, but she won't object to its consulting with and subcontracting from companies that do.  She is concerned in principle with the scientist's responsibility to consider harmful effects of his research.  In practice, this means only that she would be \"sympathetic\" to a scientist's decision not to develop a weapon if he knew in advance it would only be used destructively.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HESE PRINCIPLES are totally inadequate to deal with the complex role of the scientist--working through the universities and through companies like ADL--in developing the super-sophisticated weaponry now in use in Indochina.  \"People sniffers,\" laser- and TV-guided bombs, remote-controlled planes, and computerized bombing patterns were all developed by American scientists, yet the link is rarely direct.  The weapons are developed component by component, subcontract by subcontract, so that the scientist rarely creates the entire weapon and almost never receives a government contract stamped \"for use in Indochina.\"</span></p> <p><span>Even if ADL <i>has</i> refused to accept any more government contracts for offensive weapons to be used in Indochina, that is not enough.  Many companies subcontract from others rather than directly from the government and can claim ignorance as to the use of their products.  (This is one dodge Raytheon uses in claiming, \"We don't know of any of our products being used in Vietnam.\"  In fact their Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles are standard equipment there.)</span></p> <p><span>Further, weapons often cannot be classified as offensive or defensive.  The automated battlefield itself was originally proposed as a defensive system stretching across the DMZ to half North Vietnamese infiltration and thereby to force a cease-fire.  The scientist who conceived it hoped it would hasten peace in Indochina.  Instead it is being used over large areas of Cambodia and Laos, as well as Vietnam to prolong the war even while the troops come home.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, the essential elements of developing a particular weapon usually include basic research which frequently has civilian uses as well.  The company can thus claim that it would have done the research anyway for the civilian market but that it conveniently found military funds to finance the research.  For example, ADL currently holds a contract with the Navy Air Systems Command to test the effects of corrosion on metals.  This study is as indispensable for the Navy's furture aircraft as another company's production of guns, but Bunting--in true liberal fashion--cannot see the connection.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HUS THE ONLY effective principles for ending scientists' role in developing automated weaponry for this war and for future wars are no military contracting, no subcontracting on military contracts, and no basic research which would be directly helpful to the military.  Bunting refuses to adopt these principles, and thereby destroys her chance of ending ADL's usefulness to the military.</span></p> <p><span>If, as I suspect, Bunting is joining ADL's board more as an old friend of Gavin's than as a champion of the public interest, then she is doing the public a disservice by lending prestige, credibility, and a liberal image to a company which deserves none of these.</span></p>"}

As we face the gravest crisis in a decade, we must not forget that it is the Indochinese people who continue to suffer as American planes thunder overhead and a U.S. supported government prosecutes a monstrous war.  The President has told Hanoi:  surrender, or else we will starve you into submission.  We ask the President how much of the world he is willing to destroy in his effort to impose the American will.</span></p> <p><span>In his speech last night, the President went beyond the most foolhardy policies of his predecessors.  Previously, when the most exuberant military and civilian advisers recommended mining North Vietnam's harbors, the President in office always bowed to reason and refused to raise the conflict to a new and dangerous level.  Nixon's desperate step proves the bankruptcy of his Vietnamization policy.  We rejoice in the failure of his evil plans, but we tremble at the prospects that his mad actions foreshadow.</span></p> <p><span>Will the allies of North Vietnam passively accept this new provocation?  Will the Soviet Union withdraw its ships from Haiphong harbor and bow to American arrogance?  Will the Chinese sit by calmly as the railroads and highways by their borders are bombed?  The President has thumbed his nose at the other superpowers and dared them to respond.</span></p> <p><span>For there is no doubt:  the latest American tactic is a clear provocation.  Nixon offered nothing new in his speech last night.  He has been proposing an immediate ceasefire and a release of prisoners-of-war since October, 1970.  Refusing to discuss a political settlement, he is asking the other side to give up their guns and their bargaining counters at once.  He is demanding the surrender of the armed cadres of the Vietnamese liberation movement.  The Vietnamese have been struggling far too long to give up now.  But the President apparently is willing to destroy their country--and maybe ours as well--to make sure that their struggle fails.</span></p> <p><span>\"Let us not slide back toward the dark shadows of a previous age,\" the President pompously told Moscow last night.  \"We do not ask you to sacrifice your principles or your friends.\"  Reaching a new depth in sickening self-righteousness, Nixon instructed his opponents to tuck in their tails and run.  As he ran amuck, he demanded restraint.</span></p> <p><span>In the face of nuclear disaster, we too pray that China and the Soviet Union will exercise restraint.  But from the American people, we hope for the opposite.  Critics of the President and his war policy have been too restrained for too long.  As Nixon revs up the war machine and veers toward the abyss, we must place ourselves in his path.  We must force the slaughter to a halt.</span></p> <p><span>At this time, groups here in Boston and throughout the nation are discussing ways to voice the general outrage.  Massive civil disobedience in Washington is being considered.  We support it.  We support all reasoned actions to reverse Nixon's drastic error and bring the war to a close.  As the President surrounds North Vietnam, attempting to choke off the liberation movement, it is particularly appropriate for us to surround his buildings and strangle the American war effort.</span></p> <p><span>Time is short.  The mines that Nixon placed in the territorial waters of North Vietnam will activate automatically at 6 a.m.  Thursday, Washington time.  No one knows what will happen next.</span></p> <p><span>We cannot afford to waste an hour making pointless demands of this University.  We have tried that before--unsuccessfully.  Instead, we must aim our force against the source of the suffering:  the United States government.  The varmakers in our midst are most vulnerable now, as they bear the attacks of people throughout the world.</span></p> <p><span>The Nixon Administration is plainly desperate if it is willing to risk the promised glory of a Russian journey.  The people of Vietnam are defeating the invader.  As long as it insists on winning, the U.S. can make no exit.  Like a trapped rodent gnawing at its leg, Nixon is ripping apart his hopes for diplomatic triumphs in Moscow and Peking.  Now is the time to push the U.S. out of Indochina.

{"title": "The Offensive In Vietnam | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>F</b>OR THE first time since Dien Bien Phu, the armies of North Vietnam have moved <i>en masse</i> against a Western power intent on ruling in their country.  The current offensive in Vietnam is not politically senseless, nor is it an exercise in random brutality; it is firmly rooted in the political torment and human anguish that have been created by American policy.  And we can only hope that the Americans and their South Vietnamese mercenaries will suffer the same fate as did the French in 1954.</span></p> <p><span>For all the chaos and destruction which the war has caused in Vietnam and in this country, the issue at stake is a relatively simple one:  whether the American client regime of Nguyen Van Thieu will be allowed to impose its political will on the people of South Vietnam.  This has been the central issue of the Paris negotiations, and it is the crux of the current stalemate.  The position held by North Vietnam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government in the South is that the Thieu regime must give way to a neutral coalition government which will then supervise elections in South Vietnam.  But the United States has consistently stipulated that elections take place under the aegis of the current Saigon regime, a situation that would amount to no genuine elections at all.</span></p> <p><span>It is clear that Hanoi and the PRG cannot accept the central demand of Washington's position, and it is evident that the position is an unfair and inflexible one.  Yet President Nixon and his advisors have decided that their holding the Saigon regime in place is essential to America's credibility as a global power, and they have decided that the regime must be upheld at any cost.  Invasions and ceaseless bombing of Cambodia and Laos, the drastic and brutal air strikes on North Vietnam in late 1970 and 1971, and a grueling three-year pacification program in South Vietnam's countryside are the concrete results of Washington's failure to gain acceptance of its puppet regime at the Paris talks.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>LONG WITH its policies of military coercion, Washington has consistently attempted to make Hanoi appear the guilty party in the collapse of the negotiations.  And it is an effort that has continued since the abrupt dismissal last July of the U.S. delegate in Paris, David Bruce, who was apparently fired for having advocated serious consideration of the PRG's Seven Point proposal.  Bruce's successor, William J. Porter, formerly in charge of pacification for South Vietnam, was not sent to Paris to undertake serious negotiation; he was sent there to engage in reckless provocation, to treat the representatives of Hanoi and the PRG in such a gross and banal fashion that the other side--or so Washington hoped--would break off the talks.  Last January 25, Nixon abruptly disclosed the existence of secret talks between Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho.  In what was undoubtedly a highly distorted account of those negotiations, the President destroyed the only remaining channel of effective discussion for the simple purpose of winning domestic and international public support in his continuation of the war.  And when Hanoi and the PRG refused to play into his hands by boycotting the public sessions in Paris, Nixon broke off those talks himself, allowing Porter to declare that the negotiations could resume only if the other side demonstrated first that it was interested in \"serious\" talks, which presumably meant talks on American terms.</span></p> <p><span>It was in this context of continued American intransigence, capped by Porter's statement that the representatives of the Vietnamese liberation forces would have to grovel on their knees before him in order to get the talks resumed, that the North Vietnamese offensive unfolded last week.  And since the offensive began, the U.S. position has hardened even further.  For the first time since 1968, the American command has begun systematic, round-the-clock bombing inside North Vietnam.  And Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird announced late last week that the bombing would not stop until North Vietnam began \"serious\" negotiations with the United States.  The statements by Laird and Porter have thus placed Hanoi in the position of having to beg the United States to stop bombing North Vietnam--or to overthrow the Saigon regime and forcibly dislodge the U.S. military machine from all Indochina so that further bombing is impossible.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HUS FAR, the United States has refrained from enacting the more drastic possibilities of escalation because it has been caught in a bind by North Vietnam's clever timing.  The President is scheduled to travel to Moscow next month for talks with Soviet leaders and the possible signing of a partial ABM treaty, and his advisors are extremely edgy about undertaking any action against Moscow's allies in Hanoi that might provoke Soviet cancellation of the summit meeting.  By staging its offensive at this time, North Vietnam has skillfully exploited the internal contradictions of Washington's policy:  after all, the United States really should not be able to make peace with the Soviet Union while it continues its war against North Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, the unmistakable objective of the current North Vietnamese drive is the overthrow of the Saigon regime.  And if events in South Vietnam should soon reach a stage where Washington feels it must act decisively to save the regime, even at the expense of the Moscow summit, we must brace for the possibility of further American escalation in the war.  There are several possibilities for what form this new escalation might take:  sustained bombing of North Vietnam above the 20th Parallel, air raids on Hanoi and Haiphong, the destruction of North Vietnam's irrigation dikes, or the use of tactical nuclear weapons to rout the North Vietnamese from positions in South Vietnam.  And we cannot stand by passively, as we have done so often in the past, if a new escalation against the real forces of freedom in Vietnam is perpetrated by our government.  We must poise ourselves for resistance and be able to act with decisiveness and resolution.  We must march and demonstrate in the streets, we must engage in civil disruption, we must abandon our complacent posturing and convince our government that it cannot wage war against the Vietnamese people and keep order in this country at the same time.  And we must determine that our resistance is to be meaningful and lasting.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T REMAINS FOR the Vietnamese to accomplish what no antiwar movement in this country has been able to do:  to rid South Vietnam of the Thieu regime and end American involvement in Indochina.  Yet that does not diminish the feeling that our support for the North Vietnamese in the time of their greatest anguish and trial must be strong and convincing.  The Vietnamese fighters whom American planes are bombing are not our enemies:  they are the only progressive force in South Vietnam.  It is time we realized this, and put our realization into practice.  And the time has long since arrived for an immediate and total U.S. withdrawal and for an unambiguous defeat of America's puppet regime in South Vietnam.  The sooner they come, the better.</span></p>"}

The basis for this argument revolves around a series of incidents in the New Hampshire primary which supposedly changed the heretofore clean campaign \"into a cesspool of low-blows and innuendos.\"</span></p> <p><span>These are pretty forceful words and would seem to indicate a sense of moral outrage over the magnitude of Senator Muskie's alleged deceitfulness.  Yet a close look at a couple of these incidents will reveal that only by twisting the facts and by giving credence to rumor can one work oneself into a state of moral outrage against the Muskie New Hampshire campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Mr. Feldberg's first charge of deceit centers on his implication that Senator Muskie's campaign disclosures in 1970 are \"mostly irrelevant\" because they only applied to the Maine Senate race.  However, the truth of the matter is that in October 1970 Senator Muskie revealed funds that were slated for his presidential bid as well as the Senate race--a move none of his rivals followed.</span></p> <p><span>The piece also tries to imply that Senator Muskie has claimed that because both he and Senator McGovern voted for the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution their positions on the War have always been the same.  In fact, Senator Muskie has never claimed that he and McGovern have the same records on the War and has repeatedly in this campaign publicly admitted that his own position was wrong on the War prior to 1969.  All Senator Muskie has contended is that since that time he and George McGovern have not significantly differed in their approach to ending our involvement in Indochina.</span></p> <p><span>Mr. Feldberg closes his piece by resorting to cliches to suggest that Ed Muskie is the candidate of the \"tough cigar-chomping con men\" and bosses.  This type of smear is unsubstantiated, deceitful and even smacks of desperation.</span></p> <p><span>The purpose of this letter is not to attack Senator McGovern.  It is meant, however, as a protest against the type of venomous half truths being used against Senator Muskie and which are coming out of certain parts of the McGovern camp.  Mr. Feldberg's signed piece is typical of the self-righteous attitude of these attacks in its pretensions that the McGovern campaign is one which has a monopoly on virtue and political purity.  This is simply not so.</span></p> <p><span>The Muskie candidacy, just as much as George McGovern's, is based on an effort to oust the Nixon administration and unite America in pursuing the goals of progressive change in the 1970's.  This new course if it is to suceed cannot be based on Feldberg's divisive type of self-righteousness.</span></p> <p><span>Really we practitioners of the new politics ought to be able to do better than that. <b>Ira Forman '74</b> \u00a0\u00a0<b>Co-chairman of H-R Students for Muskie</b></span></p>"}

{"title": "\"Oscar Wiles\" | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The <i>kitsch</i> didn't really hit the fan until the scene was set for Charles Chaplin's honorary Oscar.  Daniel Taradash, the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and Hollywood lefty of decent standing, introduced the world's greatest film comic and actor--and some would say director--as a man who always strove to prove that \"man's humanity to man is far greater than his inhumanity to man.\"  Then, after a film clip melange predictably slapped together by Peter boy-do-I-know-films Bogdanovich.  Chaplin emerged from the same stage cockpit as the first gargantuan statue which Joel Grey had serenaded with an ode to the studios in the opening number.</span></p> <p><span>And, dammit all, the man was crying.  As the sequined obsequious applauded, as Taradash called for a chorus of \"Smile,\" even as he was framed by the TV insignia of not only Shell (\"our products perform\") but Chevrolet (\"...see the U.S.A.\")--Chaplin was touched.  After years of exile self-imposed after more than a decade of government harassment and two decades of press scandal-mongering, he had returned to reap the honor of an industry which, with its new \"enlightened\" veneer, is always up for the chance to acquire a \"humane\" credential.  He gave the 44th annual presentation of awards an emotional kick it really couldn't handle, and thus made the show harder for a slumming viewer to enjoy.</span></p> <p><span>By now the only excuse for watching the ceremonies is the appeal of a mildly decadent good time.  It's been so long since people really believed Hollywood to produce much \"popular art\" that serious aggravation over inadequate nominations--once a favorite space-filling ploy of earnest local columnists--has virtually ceased.  And, as it's doubtful that Oscars add much today to a picture's gross, even \"industry-followers\" are left without an alibi.</span></p> <p><span>The Oscars, in short, are just another horserace, which makes the contest perfect for the armchair attitudinizing most \"culture\" demons don't have a chance to indulge in.</span></p> <p><span>This year's nominations were altogether perverse.  Although legends of ballot-stuffing are legion, usually the good ladies and gentlemen of the Academy pick the films they feel are good for the industry image.  How anyone could back an out-and-out stinker like <i>Nicholas and Alexandra</i> while there were greater moneymakers of far greater quality in the offing--<i>Sunday.  Bloody Sunday, McCabe and Mrs. Miller.  Little Murders.  Straw Dogs</i>--is beyond the understanding of rational man.  (Especially as <i>Nick and Alex</i> was produced independently.)</span></p> <p><span>Once the nominations were set, the winners followed fairly logically.  A bunch of sentimental favorites like Ben Johnson, Gene Hackman (always pick the Hollywood veteran over a qualified candidate without the homegrown background).  Sops for such costly items as negligible as <i>Bedknobs and Broom-sticks.</i>  And the final award tally divided between what Hollywood thinks of as Art--<i>The Last Picture Show</i>--and what it makes better, enjoys more, and thrives on financially--<i>The French Connection.</i></span></p> <p><span>Consider, however, that most critical film circles in this country, given the same nominees for Best Picture, would have picked Kubrick's <i>Clock work Orange,</i> the most highhanded and humorless allegory since the Old Testament, and you might be won over to the Academy's way of thinking.</span></p> <p><span>Actually, there was one major disappointment which even the most casual observer couldn't fail to note.  Jane Fonda did not cite Merleau-Ponte or Cesar Chavez or George McGovern for inspiring her winning performance in <i>Klute,</i> didn't chastise the hypocrites who would never have backed Chaplin when he was under fire--didn't really say much of anything.  She simply thanked the Academy and walked off the stage, showing far more class than to indulge in the liberal sanctimony which has marked the affair in years past.  I hope she boycotted the post-awards parties as well.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Nixon and Mao:  The Coming of the Thaw | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b><i>Introduction</i></b></span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE GROWING WARMTH in Sino-American relations, as demonstrated by President Nixon's recent trip to China, has attracted great public interest.  Several years ago, before the Nixon Administration had publicly indicated its desire for improved relations with the People's Republic of China, it appeared that the two countries would continue their heated confrontation.  This paper--written in October 1969--provides some of the background for the surprising reconciliation and some of the motives of the two great powers involved.</span></p> <p><span>President Nixon, in an article in Foreign Affairs in 1967, had expressed a desire to deal with China more forthrightly.  In an interview published by the London Observer on November 24, 1968, Nixon restated that view.  It may be fair to say, therefore, that president Nixon is most responsible for the initiation of improved relations with China--and not his National Security Affairs adviser, Henry Kissinger.</span></p> <p><span>Important also is the fact that as early as November 26, 1968, the Chinese had clearly demonstrated that Taiwan and not the massive American presence in Vietnam was the main obstacle to better relations with Washington.</span></p> <p><span>In the nearly three years between Peking's hints of a desire for improved relations and the Nixon trip, the U.S. eased its economic blockade and withdrew almost all of its fleet from the Taiwan Straits area.  The Chinese were preoccupied with their strained relations with the Soviet Union and Japan.  With the visit of the U.S. ping pong team to China and the interview of Chairman Mao by Edgar Snow which indicated that China would welcome a visit by Nixon, Sino-American relations began to blossom furiously.</span></p> <p><span>What follows is a major portion of the author's paper written 30 months ago.  A fully annotated copy of the entire paper is available at the <i>Crimson.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS AN ANALYSIS</b></span></p> <p><span><b>R</b>ECENTLY, members of the Nixon Administration have shown interest in starting a dialogue with Mainland China.  Whether or not their efforts will be fruitful may depend on several events between November 26, 1968, when Peking last proposed, to have informal, ambassadorial-level talks in Warsaw, and February 19, 1969, when the Chinese cancelled these talks a day before they were to begin.</span></p> <p><span>What were these events?  What do they mean in light of each country's foreign and domestic problems?  And how can the Nixon Administration apply the knowledge gained from these events to make its China Policy effective in ending current tensions with the Mainland?  Clearly, there are no simple answers to these questions, but the following explanation outlines one approach which seems most relevant to the writer...</span></p> <p><span><i>Summary Of Events</i></span></p> <p><span>On November 26, 1968, a spokesman of the Information Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the United States of postponing the Warsaw talks scheduled for November 20, even though the Chinese had already offered to give \"consideration\" to having them February 20, 1969, at which time, \"the new U.S. president (Mr. Nixon) will have been in office for a month and the U.S. side will probably be able to make up its mind.\"  In his statement the spokesman went so far as to list two principles which were to be discussed on February 20.  \"First, the U.S. Government undertakes to immediately withdraw all its armed forces from China's territory Taiwan Province and the Taiwan Straits area and dismantle all its military installations in Taiwan Province; secondly, the U.S. Government agrees that China and the United States conclude an agreement on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.\"</span></p> <p><span>Also, the day before the Foreign Ministry Information spokesman delivered his statement, the Communist Chinese press republished Mao's ten-section \"Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.\"  The report, published for study and application by the masses, included two statements on timely subjects.  One was on the maintenance of revolutionary discipline in the armed forces.  The other dealt with peace talks.  Mao wrote, \"We should not refuse to enter into negotiations because we are afraid of trouble and want to avoid complications, nor should we enter into negotiations with our minds in a haze.  We should be firm in principle:  we should also have all the flexibility permissible and necessary for carrying out our principles.\"</span></p> <p><span>On November 24, 1968, the London Observer published an interview with President-elect Nixon in which he discussed three points concerning U.S.-China Policy:  (1) the U.S. must help the Southeast Asian countries achieve economic and military viability so as to become unattractive as targets for Chinese subversion:  (2) after achieving this goal, conditions would be favorable for negotiations with China, so long as (3) Communist China recognizes that \"military expansion will lead to world conflict, and world conflict is unthinkable\" and diverts her energies to the solution of internal problems.</span></p> <p><span>It should be pointed out that Nixon's statement was unofficial, while the Chinese Foreign Ministry statement reflected government policy.</span></p> <p><span>Neither the U.S. nor China made any significant public mention of the ensuing negotiations for two months.  The Mainland press did allot considerable space to worker and peasant denunciations of Nixon's inaugural address, but it did not refer to the talks until in late January, 1969, when the U.S. State Department announced the defection of Liao Ho-shu, a Chinese diplomat in the Netherlands.  Then, on February 4, a spokesman of the Foreign Ministry Information Department in Peking said that both the removal of Liao Ho-shu to the U.S. and American hostility to China show that \"U.S. President Nixon and his predecessor Johnson are jackals of the same lair without the least difference.\"  The spokesman also threatened \"grave consequences\" should Liao not be handed back to China.  On February 19, the spokesman announced Peking's cancellation of the Warsaw talks without setting a date for a future meeting.</span></p> <p><span>Immediately afterwards, a State Department spokesman announced that had the talks been held, American representatives in Warsaw \"had been instructed to make or renew constructive suggestions.  These included consideration of an agreement on peaceful coexistence, consistent with our treaty obligations in the area, the subjects of exchange of reporters, scholars, scientists, and scientific information, and regularization of postal and telecommunications problems.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>Analysis</i></span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>FTER THREE YEARS of unprecedented hostility toward the U.S. government, why did Peking make a friendly offer to negotiate?  The change of administrations in Washington is an obvious answer.  Peking showed the new President her desire to negotiate so as to ease hostilities.  But on November 24, Nixon had publicly endorsed the old China Policy:  was there, then, another important reason behind Peking's proposal?  Perhaps the explanation is that the Chinese were land remains very uneasy over their northern boundary with the Soviets.</span></p> <p><span>Another possible reason for Peking's proposal may have been that she wanted to trade with the U.S. In the republished report of March, 1949.  Mao pointed out, \"So far as possible, we must first of all trade with socialist countries.\"  With the Soviet-dominated nations hostile to her.  Communist China may have been searching for more dependable sources to take over the 18 per cent of her foreign trade which has gone to the Socialist bloc in recent years, and one of these sources may have been the U.S. However, in order to trade with the United States, Peking would have found it necessary to find some way to end Washington's trade embargo against her, perhaps through negotiations.</span></p> <p><span>How did Washington policy makers respond to the Chinese proposal of November 26?  Passively.  Meanwhile, the new President spoke of entering \"an era of negotiation\" but he put emphasis on parleying with the Soviets.  Nixon might have shown a more positive attitude, as nearly half of the U.S. defense budget is directed against a wide range of Chinese \"threats.\"</span></p> <p><span>Why did Peking cancel the talks?  One superficial view is that changes in the Peking leadership resulted in the refusal.  A more likely hypothesis is that the Chinese felt that if a defector was more important to the Americans than talking to China, then the U.S. must not have been too interested in negotiation anyway.  There are several unknowns in this interpretation which may, in themselves, be answers.  Was it only coincidence that Liao chose to defect barely a month before the Warsaw talks were to begin?  Was it only chance that the clash with Soviet forces on the Ussuri River occurred searcely a week and a half after Peking had cancelled the negotiations, that is, only a short time after Moscow could be reasonably certain Sino-American relations would remain unimproved?</span></p> <p><span>One State Department official has argued that it is a sad state of affairs when one country allows so slight an incident as the defection of a diplomat to another country to surpass in importance forthcoming negotiations with that country over consequential issues.  Perhaps the Chinese side (again) saw the Liao incident as an undeserved insult which indicated continued U.S. unwillingness to negotiate seriously--to them, the \"current anti-China atmosphere\" (in the U.S. government) made it \"obviously most unsuitable\" to hold talks.  The Chinese implied that once this \"atmosphere\" has dissipated, they would be willing to negotiate; but they must first know that the U.S. in ready to communicate its real intentions to them.</span></p> <p><span>The devices Peking used to condemn the Liao incident shed light on the reasons for her cancellation.  In the notes of February 4 and 19, the Chinese went out of their way to emphasize displeasure with Washington's treatment of the Liao affair rather than the mere fact that he had been granted diplomatic asylum.  The first sentence of the February 4 note objected to the State Department's \"brazenly\" announcing the defection, while the second note said that the U.S.'s plotting \"to send Liao Ho-shu to Taiwan with a view to creating further anti-China incidents\" merits \"particular\" attention.  The Chinese appeared to consider the U.S. handling of the incident unreasonable and indicative of how bad Sino-American relations would be in the next four years.</span></p> <p><span>To inform Peking of a change in the U.S. stand so as to clear the \"haze\" out of the minds of the leaders there concerning U.S. intentions, the Nixon Administration must first convince them of U.S. sincerity.  Since the Chinese cancelled the February 20 talks, the State Department has carried out some of the unilateral steps its spokesman said would have been raised had the talks been held that day.  A more substantive approach would be to completely end the U.S. trade embargo against the Mainland.</span></p> <p><span>But more important, the U.S. should assure Peking that it would not attack her fledgling nuclear arsenal and that it would use nuclear weapons against her only in self-defense; assurances followed by the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear warheads around her would be even more effective.</span></p> <p><span><i>Conclusion</i></span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE GENERAL ATTITUDE which underlies the old China Policy is that as long as the \"irrational\" Mao governs the Mainland, there can be no serious talks with his government.  Peking feels the same way about the capitalist ruling class in America (whose nature, they say, can never change).  But what the State Department China Policy makers overlook is that the most important factor in negotiation is the readiness of both sides to get down to business, and this readiness depends more on the political and security situation of the negotiating countries at a particular time than on who governs either country.  For some reason, perhaps the tension on her border with the Soviets.  Peking has indicated a desire to negotiate with flexibility so as to achieve peaceful coexistence with the United States.  Instead of waiting until Mao dies, Washington should consider formulating some new, serious proposals on Taiwan (and the other matters mentioned above) to test the extent of Chinese willingness to patch up relations.</span></p> <p><span>* These five principles are respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-agression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence</span></p>"}
{"title": "GRADUATE STUDENTS AND DEFICITS | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>To the Editors of the <b>Crimson:</b></span></p> <p><span>We are concerned with the impression given to many that the recommendations of the Faculty Committee on Fellowships and Other Aids for Graduate Students of March 27 constitutes a response to the Graduate Students and Teaching Fellows Union's demands.</span></p> <p><span>First, whatever the content of the Committee's report, it is neither a response to the Union, nor even a statement of Administration policy, but merely \"the sense of the meeting\" of that committee.  Second, the proposed minimum of $800,000 for next year is inadequate to meet the needs of teaching fellows even at this year's level.  At least 200 additional teaching fellows are expected to apply for tuition abatements for next year, and, it should be remembered, tuition has been raised $200 for those teaching fellows not on reduced tuition.  According to Administration figures, then, a minimum of 1.1 million is needed for next year, and not the proposed $800,000.  If adjustments are going to be made, we ought to be talking about a reasonable base figure.</span></p> <p><span>The most disturbing part of this committee's report is its failure to indicate the sources of the money it proposes to distribute to teaching fellows.  Funds for tuition abatement must not come at the expense of other graduate student support, the pay of nonprofessional employees, undergraduate scholarships, or the quality of graduate or undergraduate education.  When the Union first issued its demands, commitments had already been made to graduate students on the scholarship dockets of their departments.  We believe those commitments should be honored, and are deeply distressed that the Faculty Committee did not feel required to acknowledge them.  A committee report or Administration statement cannot be seriously considered unless it provides guarantees that graduate student aid will not be diminished to provide funds for teaching fellows.</span></p> <p><span>There has been widespread confusion regarding the Union's position on the need for a criterion of equity on the distribution of University aid funds.  The Union is naturally concerned about questions of equity, but it does not believe that taking expected salary income away from teaching fellows (the tuition stipend) constitutes an acceptable application of this criterion.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, it is the Union's position that equity is not achieved by transferring funds away from the lowest paid employees of the University.  The Administration's highly touted defense of the equity principle is analogous to President Nixon's advising the residents of Roxbury to redistribute their income amongst themselves in the interests of equity in America.</span></p> <p><span>The Financial Research Committee of the Union has already suggested that viable alternative income sources do exist within the University for the support of students.  Precise information, however, is hard to come by so long as the University's books, accounting practices, and financial priorities remain mysterious to all members of the academic community.</span></p> <p><span>On Arpil 3, the New York Times carried an article on the Harvard University Press.  Last year the Press suffered a record deficit of over $500,000.  This year the Press has a new administrator--Harvard's new Vice-President Stephen Hall, who comes to Harvard from his previous post as director of \"operations support\" for ITT.  The article reports that President Bok \"intended to reduce its (the Press') deficit sharply because we've reached; the point where many of our graduate students don't have financial aid and we must revise our priorities.\"  We are gratified to learn of Bok's concern for graduate education, but surprised to hear that the only source of funds discovered to date are from the deficits of the University Press.  The Union's demand for full financial disclosure, if met, would make informed and serious discussion of University financial priorities possible--without the intermediary of the New York Times.</span></p> <p><span>If the Union is recognized, it will be pleased to send representatives to the Administration to discuss needbased scholarship programs, financial priorities, and decisions that will effect the quality of education at Harvard.  These matters are the business of the entire community, not just Bok, Dunlop, Jones, their cohorts, and the New York Times. <b>Steering Committee</b> \u00a0\u00a0<b>Graduate Students and Teaching Fellows Union</b></span></p>"}

It might be the sort of weekend to lie in the grass listening to songs of young romance on WROR--FM and read old Bennett Beach columns, to toss a whiffle ball or lick a yogurt cone strolling down Brattle Street.  That sort of weekend is the oregano of our salad lays--and it might seem hard to knock.</span></p> <p><span>But one doesn't have to be in love with politics to wince at the idea of a Cambridge idyll this weekend.  Pleasure-as usual requires a certain peace of mind, and with the United States maiming Indochina to camouflage the open lie of Vietnamization, I find peace of mind hard to come by, No matter how much many of us have come to sneer at the value of anti-war protest in the past two years, I find it impossible to sit around passively while Nixon throttles this war up to a bloody new pitch.  The memory of those dreary marches in the past that tottered between the inanity of Pepsi Generation DJ's and the chaotic in-fighting of splinter group radicals has inhibited many of us from political activity for two year.  While we might have been fools then in an embarrassment of youth, we would be infinitely worse now if we let Nixon get away with massacring a people to save his proud and political neck.  If we are to build again that sense of domestic crisis that succeeded in getting the U.S. out of Cambodia, we will have to lose our inhibitions, lose our weekend and do everything we can think of to end the war.</span></p> <p><span>First is the national student strike.  We learned two years ago who debilitating a strike can be when turned inward.  There is little reason to lose time picketing classes in a vain attempt to \"shut down\" the university.  Students can strike against the war regardless of the university--we need the university to close as little as we need its permission to go ahead demonstrating against the war.</span></p> <p><span>Saturday instead of being out on the banks of the Charles you might go to New York for the anti-war march.  A junior in Lowell House said that marching would be only \"shaking your fist\" at the Nixon administration.  At the least it would be that-and for many people first shaking would be that-and for many people first shaking would be worth the eight hour round trip--but if the demonstration were as big as anti-war sentiment is, Nixon might begin seeing expediency differently.</span></p> <p><span>The New York march is assembling at 72nd Street and Central Park West, right on the edge of the park, at 10 a.m.  The march will begin at noon, go down Columbus Avenue, through \"Times square to Bryant Park.  A rally will begin at 1 p.m. across from the park at 40th Street and Sixth Avenue.  Among the speakers will be Senator Mike Gravel (D. Alaska), Congressmen William Fitz Ryan and Bella Abzug--both Democrats from Manhattan, and a variety of labor, anti-war and fights leaders.  The rally is scheduled to last until 4:30, Greater Boston Peace Action Coalition (GBPac) is coordinating plans for the march from here.  They will have buses leaving Tech Square at MIT 1930 Main St., Cambridge) 6 a.m. Saturday morning, Tickets for the buses will be sold at tables set up arond town or at their office (15 Sellers St., Cambridge; 661-1090), Buses will return after the rally; the round-trip fare is $10.00.</span></p> <p><span>Some people might groan at the suggestion of another march, but they are pitying themselves without reason.  Two years ago Nixon backed down when faced with a domestic crisis, and there is every reason he will again.  For many people sitting still while the United States annhilates the Vietnamese people is a simple impossibility.  It would take nerve getting a suntan this weekend lieing on your back.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Disciplined Protest | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE overwhelming support for sustained antiwar activity voiced at last night's mass meeting now makes it all the more important that our protest be well thought out and well-directed if our activity is not to be dissipated as it was in the spring of 1970.  And the overwhelming lesson of our largely futile adventure after Cambodia is that an antiwar movement must acquire a coherent, long-range perspective if it is to survive.</span></p> <p><span>The character of the war has changed importantly since the invasion of Cambodia, with the result that the possibilities of effective protest against the war have become much more sharply defined.  Until mid-1970.  President Nixon's war strategy still depended primarily on his ability to use American ground troops in any fashion he desired.  For that reason, the issue of American casualties--as opposed to the more profound and fundamental issue of the war policy itself--was the center of public attention in the aftermath of Cambodia.  And much of the nationwide outrage that followed the invasion was inspired by an aspect of the war that was only tactical.  The diffuse and directionless protest in response to the invasion was easily co-opted by a peripheral concession.  Nixon learned his lesson:  do not make ground troops the crux of American involvement in the war.  The failure of Saigon's invasion of Laos the following February, an invasion which took place without U.S. assistance on the ground, may be the only concrete success of the protest following Cambodia.</span></p> <p><span>But since the demand for immediate withdrawal was overwhelmed by the demand to cut American casualties, the war continued to rage onward, with U.S. air power playing the major role in the preservation of the Saigon regime.  Since Cambodia, an immense American armada has ravaged the people and land of Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam with death and destruction from the air.  It has become the linchpin of Nixon's policy--a fact to which we awakened with the brutal air strikes last week against Hanoi and Haiphong.  Up until now, the White House has found domestic opposition to the air war to be easily manageable.  And Hanoi and the NLF, while once they were able to contain an aggression that involved a finite number of U.S. troops on their home ground, are now almost powerless to do anything to halt the planes that are bombing them from bases in Thailand, Guam and elsewhere.  Strong and effective public protest in this country is the only force that can now bring an end to the war.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>IXON and his senior advisors are acutely aware of the connection between public opposition at home and their ability to continue the war.  Henry Kissinger has privately told reporters that a major fear he shares with the President is that \"domestic protest in this country reaches a level where Hanoi simply awaits the collapse of our domestic position.\"  And it has by now almost become a truism that the President, if faced with the threat of massive dissent or disruption in the United States, will have to rethink his prosecution of the war.  And so we must determine how best to create the domestic situation that will force Nixon to meet our demands.</span></p> <p><span>WHILE it is undeniable that our perspective must stretch forward in time, it is dubious that focusing on the November Presidential election is the best strategy to pursue.  Our action must inspire a sense of crisis, a sense that the American people must strike out immediately in a way that does not depend on the hypothetical possibility of Nixon's removal seven months from now.  This is not to deny the usefulness of supporting the candidate of one's choice, or to ignore the fear held by Nixon that his war strategy may make his own re-election, impossible.  Too often, the antiwar movement has focused on one candidate, on one demonstration, and said to itself, if only this man can be elected, if only we can assemble a quarter-million demonstrators on the streets of Washington, then by this one action we will have succeeded in our goal of convincing the President that it is useless to continue the war.  Aside from its historically proven failure, such a perspective can only build cynicism and resignation as it becomes increasingly evident that the one-man, one-demonstration approach has not succeeded.</span></p> <p><span>SINCE THERE was great awareness at last night's meeting that a strike related to the University would be a bad mistake, we need not take the time to dispose of that canard.  And what remains for us to adopt is a strategy involving visible, physical protest and demonstration against the war.  Here again, it would be silly to depend on a one-shot, Moratorium-style strategy:  our demonstrations must be continuous, and they must escalate in size and militancy.  And to grow, they must carry with them a large measure of strong political logic.  They may begin with marches in the streets, and then progress to pickets of military and other war-related centers of activity.  And they must ultimately assume the form of massive, non-violent civil disobedience.  No trashing of the CFIA:  we must take great care in insuring that the people who witness our protest understand that it is directed not against them but against the war, that it is not a random or politically senseless action, that its target is that small group of officials in the highest councils of government who have violated their, the people's, interest, an interest we share.  We must be polite, respectful, and disciplined.  We must not engage in senseless physical destruction.  And if we act forcefully and comprehensibly, there is just a chance that we can contribute to a movement that will stop this war.</span></p>"}

But you can understand; 200 miles to see her son, much as I'm loved, run by her in a period of 30 seconds leaves you feeling a little empty.  Of course, old Mom came up with a partial solution last April when she brought the movie camera and got me crawling up Heartbreak Hill.</span></p> <p><span>I remember the long, cold nights in Milwaukee last month when I ran workouts in Mom's honor.  Other times I ran them for the 1000 screaming girls at Wellesley, or for George McGovern, or for orange quarters.  Often I thought of all those Wellesley girls sleeping as I ran the streets in Central Time, resting themselves so that they could cheer for me and thrust orange quarters my way.  I guess it was Skiddy von Stade who said they continue to become great housewives and mothers.  It's the sort of phenomenon that always leads me to dog it for the mile preceding Wellesley and then turn it on just before I reach the College.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, male chauvinist piggism took a step backwards yesterday in Boston when the Boston Athletic Association decided at long last to let women run officially.  It took such a big step in fact that director Will Cloney almost went so far as to kiss the winning female.  (She had the fans wondering about the reddish brown stains on the backs of her legs.)  Their participation in such numbers--seven officially--made it a bit tough on us, though, because most of the spectators' remarks I overheard were about the women, and when the top one finished she got a louder round of applause than the winner and louder even than old Johnny Kelly, who at 6-4 must represent some kind of Marathon minority.</span></p> <p><span>When the applause wasn't ringing in my ears and I wasn't thinking about sex.  I had to occupy my mind other ways.  Usually I just sang teenage death songs.  Laura's boyfriend Tommy drove to the stock car race and killed himself about 22 times during the course of the Marathon, and if that train didn't kill Teen Angel the first time, I imagine it had by the nineteenth.</span></p> <p><span>Since Mom didn't show, I got a big treat at the end--a ride back to Cambridge on the MTA.  Following the thrill of the Marathon it seemed that it was only right to take the subway; after all, if you're willing to dine with someone you ought to be willing to wash the dishes.  It was my feet that hurt most, but of course while I'd spent three hours roughing up my feet, thousands of miles away whole legs were being blown off people's bodies.</span></p>"}
{"title": "An Escalation to End Detente? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N THE LAST four weeks, the war in Vietnam has accelerated while negotiations to end it have broken off.  North Vietnam's special emissary Le Duc Tho has offered to resume negotiations with the United States, but Washington has demanded that Hanoi and the PRG stop their offensive before talks can begin.  The U.S. has now sent B-52 bombers to hit Haiphong.  The resumption of large-scale fighting in Vietnam is not only on dangering Nixon's \"era of negotiations, but they may well plunge the world into a second cold war.  Some perspective on Southeast Asian diplomacy during the last six months may cast light on this situation.</span></p> <p><span>Secret talks in Paris failed to take place last November 20 for essentially three reasons:  the presence of five U.S. aircraft carriers off the Vietnamese coast, the extensive civilian relocation in the northern part of South Vietnam, and the acceleration of Salgon's Phoenix program to wipe out communist sympathizers and political dissidents.</span></p> <p><span>On October 26, President Thieu told the French paper L'Aurore that the war had lost its political significance because there was no longer any fighting near urban areas:  it \"is now becoming a military affair.\"  In the interview, Thieu said that he wanted his splintered opposition to unite in the formation of a \"loyal opposition\" against the Communists who would be forced to surrender or be destroyed.</span></p> <p><span>North Vietnam and its allies refused to capitulate.  On November 20, Prince Souphanouvong of the Pathet Lao wrote his half-brother Souvanna Phouma that unless Phouma gave up his U.S. support, the Lao people would not \"tolerate\" his policies any longer.  Subsequent fighting began in Laos and Cambodia.</span></p> <p><span>As late as the end of November, North Vietnam retained some hope for negotiation.  North Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Duy Trinh wrote in Hoc Tap that \"diplomacy is a front of strategic importance as it has its own forces and potentialities and does not merely reflect the successes of armed and political struggle at home but also plays a positive role of its own.\"</span></p> <p><span>One month later, U.S. planes bombed North Vietnam extensively.  In January, President Nixon revealed secret negotiations that had been taking place in Paris since August 1969.  In February Nixon went to Peking, and a month later he ended the Paris negotiations.</span></p> <p><span>Nixon called off the talks at a time when Hanoi was angrily denouncing the Sino-American communique of February 27.  In an article in Nhan Dan on March 13 entitled \"The Devil's Commitments,\" a \"Commentator\" castigated Nixon's efforts to maintain his treaty commitments while simultaneously feigning peaceful intentions:</span></p> <p><span>Our people will continue to advance firmly in their march to crush the plan for the Vietnamization of the war.  Without a doubt, the revolutionary wave will sweep away every counterrevolutionary alliance and \"commitment\" and drown both the Yankee imperialists and their allies.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>IXON'S CESSATION of the Paris negotiations had yet another significance.  Now that he had returned from Peking and would soon be in Moscow, Nixon wanted to show Hanoi precisely how little it's fate mattered to the \"great councils\" of the world.  It may be, however, that Nixon has misjudged his influence with China and Russia.</span></p> <p><span>The Peking leadership is under internal pressure because of the publicity it gave Nixon during his visit.  In a recent article in the army paper, Honggi, Chi Ping indirectly justified the publication of the Nixon visit and of the Shanghai communique by allusion to Mao's saying that the masses can only learn by negative example.  Chi wrote.  \"Some comrades admit the role played by teachers by negative example, but they are doubtful about publishing the latter's counter-revolutionary sayings and actions.  They think that poisonous weeds will have a passive influence on the masses.  Such worries are unwarranted.\"</span></p> <p><span>However, the writer added.  \"Teachers by negative example can be really used only by exposing and criticizing them.  All reactionary fallacies and shameless slanders by these teachers are at once openly reactionary and fairly deceptive.  If no earnest study and incisive criticism are carried out, people often cannot discern and understand very well where the poison is and how deceptive these fallacies and slanders are.  Only through revolutionary mass cricism in which such wares have been thoroughly criticized and reactionary fallacies refuted and their deceptive and counter-revolutionary essence exposed can the masses' militant determination to struggle against the enemy be stimulated.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Chinese have thus committed themselves to condemning Nixon's policies--and it is wholly unlikely that Nixon's bombing of Haiphong will make them any more friendly to him.</span></p> <p><span>In speeches last week.  Nixon chided the Russians for their support of the North Vietnamese.  The news that the B-52s hit a Russian freighter in Haiphong harbor cannot make Moscow any friendlier.  The bombing of Haiphong and Nixon's statements concerning Russia may raise questions as to whether Nixon really wants his summit in Moscow to be a success.</span></p> <p><span>Surely, the big corporations would love to keep getting their contracts from Uncle Sam on nuclear related weaponry, contracts that would cease coming if a Salt agreement is signed.  And the big corporations can always provide \"big\" money during an election year...</span></p> <p><span>The escalation of the war in Vietnam can only lead to worsening U.S. relations with China and Russia.  Now that Nixon has sent B-52s to hit Hanoi it is unclear what else he is prepared to do and what other risks he is willing to take.</span></p> <p><span>Unless Nixon begins serious negotiations with the North Vietnamese and agrees to a political compromise in South Vietnam, he will have thoroughly nullified his own \"era of negotiations.\"  The shallow roots of friendship that he and other presidents have painstakingly established with Russia and China may well be washed away.  In their stead, an accelerated arms race and the politics of confrontation will threaten man's existence</span></p>"}

The new escalation is open-ended and runs the clear risk of catastrophic confrontation with the Soviet Union.  The war will not go away:  Nixon remains committed to military victory.  It must be resisted by the American public.</span></p> <p><span>Two years ago, in an escalation of similar magnitude.  American ground troops invaded Cambodia.  Antiwar feeling on American campuses coalesced into a national student strike.  That strike, joined in a moment of crisis, delivered an ultimatum to the American government:  you cannot expand the war in Asia without risking massive disruption at home.  The ultimatum was successful:  the invading force withdrew.  American students catalyzed a national movement that helped to save the lives of Americans.  Vietnamese, and Cambodians.  The ever-rising trajectory of the war began to turn downward.</span></p> <p><span>The Cambodia precedent denied the use of American ground troops in the 1971 invasion of Laos.  In many other moments, the antiwar movement has had similar success.  We have given crucial support to those public leaders and Congressmen who spoke out on the war.  We have brought thousands of Americans to public demonstrations of opposition.  And we have managed to set the terms of debate on the war, because our position--total and immediate U.S. withdrawal--has been firm over the years.  Despite the intricate turns in government policy and phraseology, we have stuck by an uncompromising demand that the policy of escalation by reversed and dismantled.</span></p> <p><span>A low profile war had up to recently left the front page.  Now it is back.  The current North Vietnamese National Liberation Front offensive has reduced the war to its essential components.  The Thieu government is mortally threatened.  North and South Vietnamese have united in a fierce final struggle to free their country from colonialism and neo-colonialism.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE FAILED logic of Nixon's Vietnamization policy can now be measured by his newest campaigns against North Vietnam.  If the Thieu government had the legitimacy or the strength to repel the offensive, these campaigns would not be necessary.  How far will the United States now go to maintain a regime that cannot stand on its own?</span></p> <p><span>The bombings of Hanoi and Haiphong suggest that there are no limits.  Strategic options left to the U.S. government include further bombing of population centers:  mining or closing by naval embargo the access to Haiphong harbor:  bombing the North Vietnamese dike system causing broad destruction and the likelihood of mass starvation:  invading North Vietnam:  and use of tactical nuclear weapons.  Nixon has said, \"All of our options are open.\"  We say:  \"All options except withdrawal are abhorrent.\"</span></p> <p><span>A memorandum prepared by Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and released last week by Rep. Michael Harrington (D-Mass.) clarifies our importance as students opposed to the war.  If the United States were released from \"domestic restraints,\" notes the memorandum, it might undertake amphibious operations against the North or bombing of the irrigation ditches in the quest for victory.  Clearly, Nixon is not deterred any longer by the risks of confrontation with the Soviet Union.  The likelihood of bombing Soviet ships had forestalled the bombing of Haiphong in the past.  That risk is now a reality.  The only remaining restraint is that imposed by the American people.  And it is our task as students, who have come this way before, to make sure that domestic restraints remain firm.  The bombing of North Vietnam and the cancellation of the Paris Peace Talks return the war to its pre-1968 character.</span></p> <p><span>The ghastly history of the war converges on this moment.  Joining with 14 other college newspapers, we condemn the escalation of the War against the Vietnamese and support immediate demonstrations of protest this week.  It is sad to find ourselves once again in a position where a student strike seems to be the only recourse at home to protest American policies in Southeast Asia.  But we must, in union with 14 others, call for an immediate national student strike.  To implement this, a strike meeting at Harvard should be held as soon as possible.  The strike is called not against the University, but against the War, and is proposed to offer students an opportunity to work against the War in these critical days by campaigning for antiwar candidates, leafletting in communities and factories, lobbying Washington, and joining in antiwar demonstrations such as those in New York and Los Angeles this weekend.</span></p> <p><span>The <i>Crimson</i> urges students to do everything in their power to end the war no matter what the sacrifice.  But although we urge students to put anti-war work before all else, we do not feel effort should be expended picketing classes or trying to coerce professors to call them off.  United States escalation of the war calls for massive student response:  this response should not be wasted in an attempt to shut down the University.  The national student strike should proceed regardless of the University until mass mobilization forces the Nixon Administration to end its escalation and stop the war.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson <i>also loins with The Yale Daily News, The Columbia Spectator, The Brown Daily Herald, The Cornell Daily Sun, The Dartmouth Daily, The Daily Pennsylvanian and The Daily Pennsylvanian endorsing the following editorial.</i></span></p> <p><span>The latest escalation of the war in Southeast Asia--the bombing of Haiphong and Hanoi--once again underscores the determination of the Nixon Administration to defend the Thieu regime at almost any cost.</span></p> <p><span>The massive raids that have been ordered into North Vietnam, the first such systematic and large-scale bombing attacks since April 1968, open the door to an increased, and possibly lasting.  U.S. military involvement.</span></p> <p><span>Not since American ground troops invaded Cambodia two years ago, has the Nixon Administration perpetrated such a violent military initiative.  Nonetheless, even as American soldiers have been brought all too slowly back home.  Nixon's Administration has subtly changed the war from one fought by people to one fought by machines.  American ground forces have been supplanted by B-52s, rifles by bombs.</span></p> <p><span>While the death toll of Americans has subsided, the senseless slaughter of Indochinese continues.  In its stubborn insistence in maintaining a strongly anti-communist government in Saigon, the Nixon Administration has leveled villages, wiped out entire crops and defoliated the Vietnamese countryside.</span></p> <p><span>Without American military and financial support, the Thieu regime, which is opposed by its own people, could not long survive.</span></p> <p><span>In the United States, the war has soaked up billions of dollars which could have rebuilt cities, fed the hungry and cured disease.  The war has also destroyed the confidence of the American people in their own government.</span></p> <p><span>Not since the Cambodian invasion has the Nixon government's aggression in Asia so urgently demanded protest from the American people.  The antiwar feeling that coalesced into a national student strike two years ago delivered an ultimatum to the Nixon Administration:  You cannot expand the war in Asia without risking massive disruptions at home.  This ultimatum was instrumental in foreign the American invading force to withdraw and in precluding the use of American ground troops in Laos.</span></p> <p><span>In response to the present crisis, the eight Ivy League newspapers join in calling for a one-day moratorium on business as usual Friday.  We urge our presidents to suspend university activities on that day, and we encourage all students and faculty to help shape further actions at general campus meetings.</span></p> <p><span>We call upon all Americans to join in massive demonstrations of protest in New York.  Los Angeles and San Francisco this Saturday or to engage in some other effective form of protest.</span></p> <p><span>It is time once again for the American people to voice their outrage with the Nixon Administration's continuation of the war.  Student demonstrations should not be directed against our universities but rather against the government.</span></p> <p><span>Nixon has said, \"All our options are open.\"  We say:  \"Our only option is to withdraw all U.S. support from the Thieu regime and to cease all American military activity in Indochina.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "The New New Mood | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>There are a lot of embarrassed trend watchers around the country.  The new mood on campus took a sharp turn toward familiar action this week, as startled observers who had counted out student militance saw buildings occupied, classes picketed and police forces of varying strengths shooing away antiwar demonstrators.</span></p> <p><span>The latest Nixon escalation of the war in Indochina brought an immediate, though somewhat diffused, response from students at Harvard:  Thursday night's strike meeting tried to pull together threads of protest after Tuesday's lightning attack on the CFIA.  In the midst of planning antiwar actions, the Emergency Action Coalition found itself with a new issue Wednesday when President Bok announced Harvard's decision not to sell its 671,876 shares of Gulf Oil stock.</span></p> <p><span>Silkscreen posters advertising the strike meeting curiously, though according to some antiwar planners inexplicably, began to focus on action against two wars--one in Vietnam, one in Angola where Gulf has substantial investments.  And when dawn broke Thursday, two dozen black students from Afro and the Pan African Liberation Committee took the initiative, seizing Massachusetts Hall.  There they remain, in what is by far the longest building occupation in Harvard's activist era.  University Hall, brutally cleared by waves of police after students had held the building for hardly 15 hours in 1969, provides little comparison for the Mass Hall protesters who enter their third full day of occupation this morning.</span></p> <p><span>Nor was the Mass Hall break-in as unexpected as University Hall.  For almost two months, Afro and PALC leaders had contained their frustration with the Administration's refusal to meet their divestiture demands.  The idea of a building occupation had been considered on several occasions; the first mill-in in University Hall on February 24 very nearly became a takeover.  In a meeting there, demonstrators voted not to hold the building, and since then similar votes or caucuses had decided to put off any occupation until Harvard made a decision on divestiture.</span></p> <p><span>When PALC leaders were handed that decision Wednesday afternoon, few doubted that a closed Afro meeting Wednesday night would first reject Bok's explanation to retain the stock, and then ponder a response.  It was largely a matter of which building would be taken, when and how.  But it was no surprise:  two Harvard policemen don't ordinarily spend nights in Massachusetts Hall.  As Bok said of the previously delayed, now real, occupation.  \"We weren't exactly unaware of the possibility.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "\"WHY I STRIKE\" | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>To the Editors of the Crimson:</span></p> <p><span>I am a student at the Harvard Law School and I would like to explain why I am on strike.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the \"pullout,\" President Nixon has staked his national and international reputation on the survival of South Vietnam through \"Vietnamization.\"  The present offensive threatens the failure of this strategy.  Mr. Nixon, in my opinion, is an unscrupulous man, who as the situation worsens in Vietnam will become increasingly desperate.  So far he has bombed the capitol of Hanoi and the port of Haiphong more heavily than even Lyndon Johnson dared four years ago.  There is every indication that he will go on to mine the port of Haiphong, blockade the coast and bomb ever closer to the Chinese border.</span></p> <p><span>First, I think that these actions are immoral.  To me, it is far more corrupt to kill indiscriminately from 2,000 feet up people one never sees by pushing a stainless steel bombadier's button than it is to fight on the ground.</span></p> <p><span>Second, I think that they will be ineffective.  The communists have many months' of supplies stockpiled in the south.  Johnson bombed North Vietnam for years without significant effect.  Experience in Great Britain and Germany also suggests that people tend to pull together when bombed from the air rather than giving in.</span></p> <p><span>Third, I think Nixon's plans are dangerous.  We forget sometimes that the third world war is still only a push-button away.  Damaging Russian ships and bombing closer to China risk an escalation of misunderstanding.  Nixon's brand of brinksmanship is all the more alarming because he seems oblivious to the danger.</span></p> <p><span>Only a massive public outcry can restrain Nixon from carrying out his manifest plan.  As a student, I can best contribute to such an outcry by participating in the strike.  While I think that schools should be basically nonpolitical and strongly condemn disruption of classes, I feel that these are times when students must join together to dramatically express their opinions.  I strike not against my university, but for my country. <b>Robert W. Mark</b></span></p>"}
{"title": "Thursday Night | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE LINES drawn at Thursday night's mass meeting are now to be tested.  The lines are good ones:  resolutions of shared outrage with Angolans and Indochinese, pledges to suspend normal activities in favor of anti-war actions, statements of support for present PALC demands.</span></p> <p><span>One thing is clear:  any glimmer of hope we give the oppressed peoples we support depends not on the duration of our college work suspension, and not on the extent of the damnation we register against those university members who've shown complicity in imperialist wars.  A \"strike\" line like that of 1970 would put real pressure neither on Nixon's war or the Harvard Corporation's holdings in Gulf.</span></p> <p><span>A series of escalatory acts of protest and civil disobedience against the federal government, and the support of anti-war candidates, are the only valid actions against the war.  Continuing support of actions already initiated, like the takeover of Massachusetts Hall by PALC and Afro, which turned public opinion against the Corporation's callous irresponsibility, are similarly valid.  At the same time, any attempts to direct the all-too-limited amount of political determination into purely local confrontations are sure to diminish the meeting of the long-term goals of Africans and Asians.</span></p> <p><span>For that reason, supporting amnesty for those who bravely layed their college careers and jobs on the line in seizing Massachusetts Hall, is obviously right--and just as obviously an issue which may prove to be tactically debilitating.</span></p> <p><span>Now that the affirmations of the meeting have been made, there are really two things to do:  act in the most direct way possible to help Angolans and Indochinese, and avoid any issues which will deter us from helping these people.

{"title": "Why Strike? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE ENTHUSIASTIC strike chants that brought down the curtain on Thursday night's anti-war meeting in Sanders Theater would seem to suggest that once again Harvard's students, however fired by idealism and resolve, are out to play revolution for the hell of it.  While we are asked \"to suspend all our normal activities,\" the assembly refused to explain how one can \"strike\" <i>despite</i> rather than <i>against</i> the University.  A proposal stipulating that the strike energy not be dissipated in picketing classes and coercing those who chose to attend them was prevented from even being brought to a vote.  The confusion surrounding the \"strike's\" definition is proof enough that the body assembled was determined to appropriate the heady images that accompany the word--the chants, the t-shirts, the student-as-worker masquerade--without facing up to its moral and political implications.  But a \"strike\"--even if it is a \"strike\" in name only--is a dangerous rhetorical device, the danger being that the two goals which the meeting endorsed--an end to the United States involvement in Vietnam and Harvard divestitute of its Gulf stock--will be lost in the midst of revolutionary romanticism.</span></p> <p><span>In endorsing a wide-ranging collection of antiwar protests--today's march in New York, Monday's non-violent civil disobedience, continuing educational activities, participation in the campaigns of antiwar candidates--the meeting took the necessary first step in directing the revived outrage against Nixon's recalcitrant war policies.  The establishment of a central coordinating committee ensures the development and continuation of massive student response and should result in an atmosphere of national crisis that could give Nixon pause in his pursuit of his mad adventures.  But since Harvard students are hardly averse to cutting classes, none of the above activities necessitate the call for a strike.  For--if past scenarios have anything to teach us--such defiance only results in a parochial war of attrition between those who could better spend their time on more concrete forms of antiwar work and threatened college officials.  This year's \"strikers\" assure us that this time they're out to stop bombs instead of lectures, but there is no guarantee that a response phrased in such terms can hope to do otherwise.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE CASE OF THE PALC and Afro takeover of Massachusetts Hall and their accompanying demands--that Harvard divest itself of Gulf, that it reinvest the money in the Cambridge community, and that the protestors be granted amnesty--is equally endangered by prevailing rhetoric.  The Corporation's begrudging and long-overdo response to PALC's requests has been needlessly antagonistic and its statement that it is \"not morally wrong\" to invest in companies which deal in \"repressive and in humane\" actions is itself morally repulsive.  Furthermore, Harvard's purported hope that it can initiate reform of Gulf policy by demanding further information of its activities is about as realistic as the notion that ITT would be willing to paste together its shredded memos should the Senate Judiciary Committee so request.</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, President Bok's belated expression of the moral relativism inherent in University investment is far from beside the point.  Given the fact that there is hardly a \"pure\" corporation around, there is no way that Harvard can hope to divest itself of all companies involved in imperialist ventures.  While it is certainly preferable that Harvard rid itself of the worst of them, it can at least act as a positive nuisance in the affairs of the rest.</span></p> <p><span>Let's not deceive ourselves, though.  Gulf, in underwriting the Portuguese regime, is a major offendor in this area; if only for embattled moral reasons.  Harvard <i>should</i> divest itself of Gulf stock, regardless of the precedent it will set.  But, similarly, let's not pretend that in disposing of its relatively meagre shares Harvard can expect to save black Angolese lives any more than, in 1969, Harvard's expulsion of ROTC failed to undermine the nationwide ROTC program.</span></p> <p><span>For the PALC-Afro demands--endorsed by the Thursday meeting in its enthusiasm--do not reflect the complexity of the present situation.  Harvard can not promise to avoid \"racist imperialist economic ventures in the future\"--it can only hope to forego the worst of them.  Similarly, while the occupiers are right to demand that Harvard reinvest in the community, until specific, income-producing instances are cited (after all, there are still those teaching fellows to feed) the sentiment remains Quixotic.</span></p> <p><span>How then to end the stalemate?  Through their seizure of Massachusetts Hall, Afro and PALC prevented a premature end to the investment question.  They can now best continue the struggle by abandoning the building--or else risk diverting:  campus debate to subsidiary issues like administration response and amnesty.  No one can reasonably expect that a prolonged takeover will force Bok's crisis handlers to return to the Corporation for a recount.  Despite its short-term attractiveness, a game of chicken between the protestors and the Administration is a deadend.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, pressure must now be applied to those other areas where the Corporation is vulnerable.  Systematic exposition of Harvard's policies, lobbying and-or disrupting alumni gatherings, and eventual tuition strikes offer the most fruitful forms of real escalation.</span></p> <p><span>To equate Nixon's administration with Bok's--as was done Thursday night by some of the speakers--is to be seduced by the exaggerations of the moment.  Both are, in certain vital respects, unresponsive, but the two can not be convicted of identical crimes.  If that is the assumption on which this hydra-headed strike proceeds we may as well resign ourselves to playing the game this Spring and next Spring and --who knows?--maybe even the Spring after that.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Price of 1970 | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>n 1970, the antiwar movement was faced with a crisis of similar magnitude.  Then, as now, a massive U.S. escalation of the war demanded immediate and strong response.  The antiwar movement felt--then as now--that this was the moment of supreme crisis to which we must react decisively and unequivocally.</span></p> <p><span>The 1970 student strike achieved real successes as cited in yesterday's editorial.  But faced with a demand for immediate action, many activists stopped asking the questions which had shaped the movement and given it strength:  questions of internal democracy, broad organizing strategy, and purposeful tactics of protest.  The rush to action--any action--proved irresistible.  The result, in Cambridge, was a pair of window-breaking sprees in the Square and a confused strike, centered around grades and exams; in the nation at large, it was a succession of adventurist and terrorist acts.</span></p> <p><span>It cannot be denied that these actions helped put material pressure on the government to curtail its activities in Cambodia.  But by ignoring the central questions which had shaped its identity, the antiwar movement, it is now clear, paid a terrible price for its success.  1970 was the year of the nationwide strike and the burning of ROTC buildings; it was also the year of polarization and the hard-hats.</span></p> <p><span>Since then, the movement, which seemed the vibrant and growing expression of a nationwide cry of outrage, has become tenuous and confused.  So great is our isolation, in fact, that Nixon has become convinced that we no longer exist; this isolation is largely due to the mistakes of 1970.</span></p> <p><span>This must not happen again.  We are again in a moment of crisis and great opportunity.  Public opinion polls and primary results show that vast numbers of Americans share our concerns, not only with the war but with the broad range of social issues at home.</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday's action represents almost every mistake of the 1970 strike; as in 1970, similar actions will forfeit our chance of building a broad coalition of Americans who share our views, and will leave us with only temporary success.</span></p> <p><span>We must not make that mistake twice; we must seize the moment in a way which will enable the antiwar movement to build and grow.  A serious, disciplined student strike is the first step toward that end.</span></p>"}

Such random vandalism only diffuses and debilitates the antiwar movement.  We condemn the attack on the CFIA without qualification.</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday's action resulted when a small group at an antiwar rally in downtown Boston knowingly diverted about 1000 persons at that rally to Cambridge.  Without revealing their destination, this group led demonstrators to the CFIA--even though they had explicitly stated that any protests would center on corporate, and not university, targets.</span></p> <p><span>Isolated attacks on universities, and corporations as well, are pointless when serious efforts are being made throughout the country to protest the latest escalation of the war in Southeast Asia.  History has shown that under sufficient pressure the American government, and the American people, respond to united and disciplined expressions of discontent.  Just as surely, they are repulsed by aimless violence.</span></p> <p><span>It should be pointed out that the ransacking of the CFIA was not the intent of those 2000 persons who gathered on the Boston Common yesterday.  It was the intent of a small minority of those 2000 who led the crowd blindly to Harvard and, once here, accomplished their planned assault on the building.  We censure this minority which, in a five-minute span, seriously endangered the good this week's antiwar protests could effect.</span></p> <p><span>At the same time, <i>The Crimson</i> reemphasizes the urgent need for unified, visible and disciplined demonstrations of opposition to the Nixon Administration's continued aggression in Southeast Asia.  Thursday night's strike meeting can provide the kind of coordination for antiwar protests that will prevent a recurrence of yesterday's action at the CFIA.</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday morning, along with 15 other newspapers, we called for a nationwide student strike.  We reaffirm that position.  And we repeat that this strike--the form of which will be determined by students at different campuses--is not a strike against the universities.  It is a strike against the war.  Classes need not be cancelled, exams need not be forgotten, but students here and across the country must interrupt their placid college lives to deliver once again the ultimatum to the Nixon Administration:  You cannot expand the war in Asia without risking massive protest at home.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Muskie's Politics of Deceit | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\"BELIEVE MUSKIE,\" the campaign buttons proclaim.  \"Trust Muskie,\" read the bumper stickers.  Indeed, in a campaign almost totally devoid of real debate over issues, the central theme Senator Edmund Muskie and his staff are striking is that Muskie is honest and can be trusted, no used-car salesman is this \"man from Maine.\"  Yet in the final 36 hours before the polls opened in New Hampshire last week.  Muskie and his staff were involved in four separate but related incidents of deceit that transformed the placid New Hampshire campaign into a cesspool of low blows and innuendos.  Three of these deceptions pertained to campaign financing, while the fourth was related to the war in Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>The issue of campaign financing has been a hot one ever since Senator George McGovern published a list of all his campaign contributors, and Muskie told New York Magazine reporter Richard Reeves that doing so would \"force me out of the race.  \"McGovern has been hammering away at Muskie's reticence, wondering who is on this list who might prove so embarassing to the Maine Senator.  In a typical encounter last Sunday evening, Muskie tried to skirt the issue.  In his closing remarks in a debate at the University of New Hampshire, Muskie said, \"I disclosed my sources two years before any of the other candidates.  When they didn't follow suit, I decided we needed a policy that would apply to all the candidates, including the President, so I sponsored legislation that will go into effect April 7.\"</span></p> <p><span>Muskie was referring to a report he filed at the end of 1970 with the Clerk of the House of Representatives detailing all campaign contributions he had received to that point:  his implication was that McGovern's disclosure did not include contributions he received in 1970 and \"before his announcement in 1971.\"  Yet Muskie neglected to point out that he was running for the Senate in 1970, not the Presidency, and that the contributions he received then are mostly irrelevant to the current Presidential campaign.  And as Frank Mankiewicz, McGovern's chief national political strategist, noted the next day, since the Muskie list included contributions from the National Committee for an Effective Congress and the Senate Democratic Campaign Fund, it had better be a list of contributors to his Senate campaign, or else something pretty irregular is going on.</span></p> <p><span>Muskie's charge that McGovern did not reveal contributions received prior to his formal announcement in 1971 is equally flimsy.  McGovern announced his candidacy on January 18, 1971 a full year ahead of Muskie and whatever money he received before then is so small as to be inconsequential.  Now Muskie is saying that by disclosing his Senate contributors, he set the lead in honesty; his decision not to make his Presidential campaign sources public resulted only because other, unannounced, candidates had not followed suit in 1970.  His slap at McGovern, and the basis upon which it is founded, seem aimed, clearly and simply, at deceiving voters.</span></p> <p><span>JACK ENGLISH, Muskie's top political strategist, and Dick Stewart, his national press secretary, took the deceit a step further at a press conference following the debate when they tried to persuade newsmen that McGovern's list of contributors was incomplete.  English told reporters that the Muskie staff knew of \"several people\" who had contributed $1000 or more to the McGovern campaign yet had not appeared on his disclosure list.  Indeed, said English, he knew of several people who had contributed $1000 or more to both the Muskie <i>and</i> McGovern campaigns.  But pressed by reporters to name the names-to name even one name-English and Stewart demurred.</span></p> <p><span>Suddenly, McGovern appeared in another corner of the room, and the press shifted over to him.  \"He doesn't know what he's talking about,\" McGovern said of English's first allegation.  To the contention that several people had contributed to both campaigns, McGovern replied, \"I wish he (<i>English</i>) would tell us who they are so we could collect the money.\"  English and Stewart had everything going for them except one thing:  they had no evidence to back up their claims.</span></p> <p><span>The lowest blow of all didn't come until the next day.  Someone in Muskie's entourage leaked to the phalanx of reporters that follows the Maine Senator the interesting fact that the Muskie staff had letters from two well-known contributors to liberal causes, saying that each planned to contribute $1000 to both the Muskie and McGovern campaigns.  Hearing this, the two philanthropists were outraged and denied the rumor.  McGovern himself vehemently denied the claim, and Mankiewicz called the rumor \"scandalous.\"  Even Dick Stewart, in Muskie's press room, said that no one in the Muskie office had any knowledge of the letters; at the same time no one on Muskie's staff would either confirm nor deny that they had leaked the story.  The leak exemplified the most vile kind of political ploy:  a rumor for which no one will take credit channeled to the press.  The word gets out, it gets into print, and yet no one-in this case in the Muskie Headquarters-is held accountable if it turns out to be a lie.</span></p> <p><span>THE ISSUE OF the war provided yet another opportunity for deceit from Muskie's camp.  In the debate Sunday night, Muskie carried the \"I am a dovotoo\" theme past the point of credulity.  Responding to a question which asked why each candidate thought he was different from all others, Muskie said in effect that the three liberal Senators on the podium-himself.  McGovern and Vance Hartke--all had held similar positions on the war because each had voted for the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964.  But what Muskie tactfully ignored is the fact that the other two Senators, particularly McGovern, have ardently opposed the war since its inception, while he curiously did not have the foresight to malign America's involvement until it had become a Republican war.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, Muskie avoided mention of the fact, that he had been a strong proponent of the war during the Johnson Administration, and had even been the first speaker <i>for</i> the pro-war, pro-Administration Vietnam plank at the Chicago Democratic National Convention in 1968.  All this didn't matter, Muskie tried to tell us:  all three had voted for Tonkin, so all three stood similarly on the war.</span></p> <p><span>This kind of chicanery didn't take with McGovern.  He noted his own long-standing opposition to the war, and advised Muskie that the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution passed because the Johnson Administration had wrongly and intentionally told the Senate that American ships had been attacked.  Whether this exchange between Muskie and McGovern had any effect on Tuesday's returns is not really important.  What is important is that Muskie had the nerve to attempt this blatant bit of obfuscation.</span></p> <p><span>WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO Muskie? Why has he, with his fabled Lincolnesque honesty, resorted to such tactics?  It seems clear now that in the last few days before the voting in New Hampshire.  Muskie and his staff were panicking.  Reports of Muskie's decline in support, along with McGovern's surge and the constant, daily sniping by the Manchester Union Leader, combined to break the collective cool of the Muskie camp.  Muskie himself appeared as if his nerves were shot.  Plagued by poor scheduling, he looked and was tired.  In the snowshoe parade held in his honor the Sunday before the balloting, he almost sleepwalked through the crowd, gesturing mechanically, with no expression on his face.  A glimmer of recognition would cross his face only when he came across a familiar face, but the light passed quickly when he couldn't remember to whom the face belonged.</span></p> <p><span>His staff, too, was nervous and irritable.  They were continually clearing paths for the Senator where no paths were needed, tensely bossing people around, fiercely trying to keep people <i>away</i> from Muskie.  In one 24-hour span, individual reporters were evicted from the Muskie press room, Muskie Headquarters, and an elevator in the Sheraton-Carpenter Hotel where Muskie was staying.</span></p> <p><span>But another explanation for the new Muskie tactics is gaining currency:  that the calm, soft-spoken advisors who have guided Muskie through 20 years of Maine politics are being phased out of the political side of the campaign by the tough, cigar-chomping con men who always flock to the Democratic frontrunner.  This crowd of hustlers, so artfully described by Norman Mailer in his portrait of the Humphrey campaign in 1968, is increasingly in evidence around Muskie, 1972's premier candidate of the Establishment.  It could be that the George Mitchell's and Dom Nicoll's who so expertly aided Muskie in Maine are being outmaneuvered by the pros from nice Democratic places like New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever the reason for the shift in tenor, though, Muskie will be hard put to maintain his reputation and integrity.  Incidents such as these, combined with his refusal to disclose his campaign sources, indicate a record impressive only for its deception.  Add to this the way Muskie has tried to pass of the New Hampshire.  I could have gotten it up...\" and the Honest Ed image crumbles further.  One begins to wonder whether November's election could pit Tricky Dick against Trickler Ed, or vice versa.  Either way, it isn't a very appealing choice.</span></p>"}

With 43 per cent of the vote reported, Muskie has 11 delegates to 9 for McGovern.</span></p> <p><span>McGovern is the biggest winner in the primary.  His 14 months of active campaigning and a remarkable organization effort were the main factors behind his strong showing.</span></p> <p><span>His success was particularly evident in the Manchester voting.  In 1968, Senator Eugene J. McCarthy got only 22 per cent of the vote here in a two-man race.  Tuesday, McGovern received 5693 votes here, narrowly losing the Queen City to Muskie, who got 6204.</span></p> <p><span>Muskie was clearly hurt by the constant sniping of the Manchester Union-Leader.  The Union-Leader's news pages were filled with headlines like \"Muskie's Tearful Tirade Revives History of Instability\" and \"Muskie's Lincolnesque Mask Cracked in N.H. Speech.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>McGovern Aided</b></span></p> <p><span>It is ironic that the right-wing Union-Leader's attacks against Muskie ended up by helping McGovern more than any other candidate.  Union-Leader publisher William Loeb apparently did not take McGovern seriously enough to attack him, and this, combined with Loeb's support of Yorty, served to drain votes away from Muskie and to his several rivals.</span></p> <p><span>Just as two candidates are claiming victory in the Democratic primary, two Republicans are claiming victory in their primary as well.  The third candidate, Rep. John Ashbrook (R-Ohio) is not calling the New Hampshire result a defeat.</span></p> <p><span>With 90 per cent of the votes tabulated, President Richard M. Nixon had 69 per cent.  Rep. Paul N. McCloskey (R-Calif.) 20 per cent, Ashbrook 10 per cent, and comedian Pat Paulsen 1 per cent.</span></p> <p><span><b>Nixon Showing Strong</b></span></p> <p><span>While the 30 per cent of the vote cast against the President is significant, Nixon's showing clearly demonstrates his popularity among Republicans and the efforts of liberal McCloskey and conservative Ashbrook to overtake him seem futile.  McGovern claimed Tuesday night he polled well in blue-collar areas such as Manchester, Keene (which he lost to Muskie by 20 votes out of 800) and Franklin (Muskie:  150, McGovern:  139).  However, results in heavily working-class Berlin, which Muskie carried by more than 2.5 to 1, demonstrate that Muskie is still quite strong in blue-collar areas.</span></p> <p><span>Muskie had hoped to come away from New Hampshire with an exceptionally strong showing to give his campaign a boost for the remaining 23 primaries.  While he did not get this, he has probably not been significantly hurt by the New Hampshire results.</span></p> <p><span>For McGovern, the results of this first primary mean that the press and major financial sources may begin to take his campaign more seriously.  While his showing here probably will not win him many more votes in Florida, where he appears to have little support, it should help him in the coming primaries in Wisconsin and Massachusetts</span></p>"}

On January 14, the People's Daily of Peking said that participation by \"certain Southeast Asian countries\" in the U.S.-backed aid consortium for Cambodia contradicted their support for Southeast Asian neutralization as expressed at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on November 27, 1971.</span></p> <p><span>On January 18, the same newspaper attributed to U.S. Vietnam commander General Creighton Abrams's visit to Bangkok a desire on the part of the U.S. to arrange for the dispatch of more Thai troops to Laos and Cambodia.</span></p> <p><span>Nine days later, a spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry charged that the January 19 \"border security\" agreement between Cambodia and Thailand was \"a cloak for 'legalizing' further and open invasion of Cambodia by the accomplice troops of Thailand.\"</span></p> <p><span>On February 17, the People's Daily reported that Thai troops had taken part in fighting near Cambodia's ancient temples at Angkor.</span></p> <p><span>The State Department and U.S. embassies in Bangkok and Phnom Penh have dismissed Chinese charges concerning the January 19 border agreement between Thailand and Cambodia.  These sources report that the agreement set up a \"Joint Commission on Border Control and Fisheries\" which has been given a \"vague mandate\" to study the \"border situation\" and to make \"recommendations.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"For Cambodia to the south,\" reported the Washington Post on March 5, \"the North Vietnamese and Khmer communist forces control the major portion of the border with Thailand.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>ENSION ON THE Thai-Cambodian border can only continue to mount because of an increase in Thai activity in Cambodia.  Nevertheless, in the joint U.S.-China communique signed in Shanghai on February 27, the U.S. side stipulated that it will \"progressively reduce its forces and military installations on Taiwan as the tension in the area diminishes.\"  Last week Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird emphasized that Vietnam is a focal point of tension in the area.</span></p> <p><span>One other source of tension between China, Thailand, the U.S. and Cambodia is the distribution of drilling rights for off-shore oil on the continental shelf shared by Cambodia and Thailand.</span></p> <p><span>The decline of growth in the Thai economy and the increase in activity on the part of anti-government guerrilla forces adds even further to the malaise of the Bangkok government.  During fighting on the Plain of Jars in December 1971, Thai troops suffered \"extremely heavy casualties,\" according to a London Times interview with the Defense Minister of Laos, Sisouk no Champassak.</span></p> <p><span>The future of Thailand, of U.S.-Chinese relations, and the outlook for the solution of the Southeast Asian war are integrally related to the kind of policy the U.S. adopts in the next few months.  The increased presence of Thai troops in Cambodia after the severe defeats suffered by the Cambodian army during December and January as well as those undergone by the Thai army in Laos during the same months are bad omens.  Extensive participation by Thai forces in the Indochinese war, in addition to the presence of five airbases used by U.S. bombers in Thailand, will not solve the problems of the ailing Thai economy.</span></p> <p><span>It is thus abundantly clear that if Thailand is to avoid further useless and unproductive participation in the Indochina war, an overall diplomatic solution for Southeast Asia will be necessary in the very near future.

The extensive U.S. bombing of North Vietnam during the week prior to President Nixon's visit to China has done nothing to improve chances for a rapprochement.</span></p> <p><span>In the wake of President Nixon's disclosures of secret negotiations on January 25, Le Monde and other newspapers have concluded that the \"real stumbling block\" in the Vietnam peace talks is the kind of government that would replace the present regime in Saigon in order to organize elections.</span></p> <p><span>On October 22, 1971, eleven days after the U.S. privately delivered its peace plan to the North Vietnamese, the Saigon government of President Nguyen Van Thieu publicly bragged that it would assassinate its opponents in the PRG (Provisional Revolutionary Government).  As they \"lay down their arms\" prior to elections organized under the framework of the present Saigon government all members of the PRG infrastructure and military forces would be wiped out.</span></p> <p><span><i>The necessary condition for lasting peace in Vietnam is the annihilation of all PRG forces which have infiltrated rural and urban areas,</i> reported the weekly publication of the Saigon embassy in Paris.</span></p> <p><span>The embassy publication, which frequently carries articles by high-ranking members of the Saigon Foreign Ministry, lauded the \"Phoenix\" (or Phoung Hoang) program which has served as an instrument for the assassination of those whom Saigon labels \"communists.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>In order to prevent the communists from launching a third Indochina war, the article called for tight cooperation between Saigon's civilian and military forces to ensure that the PRG forces are fully eradicated.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HILE THE VIETNAM negotiations languish, U.S. intelligence officers in Saigon are predicting that the PRG-North Vietnamese offensive which \"failed to take place\" in mid-February will occur in July and August or in November at the time of the U.S. presidential elections.</span></p> <p><span>The Baltimore Sun commented on March 4:</span></p> <p><span>Who remembers today the chorus of urgent official warnings a bare month ago against the chance of an immediate enemy offensive?  For example General Westmoreland...considered 'multiple attacks' a probability.  Who remembers the massive air strikes justified as directed against reported enemy massings for attack?  Who knows how many million of dollars worth of bombs were used, or wasted--since to our knowledge nobody has claimed that the strikes prevented the attack--in that adventure, or the extent of non-military destruction wrought?</span></p> <p><span>This comment suggests no lessons beyond the usual lessons of Vietnam, which through year after year after year have proved to be unlearnable (except, to be sure, for the lesson that the rainy season, one more of which impends, is vitally important, on one way or another, or yet another).</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE CONTINUED U.S. involvement in the Indochina war is ironic for another reason.  As the air war continues, the U.S. program to provide medical assistance to civilians injured during the war has been severely cut back.  Senator Edward M. Kennedy has pointed out that \"we cannot wash our hands\" of the plight of these civilians.</span></p> <p><span>What is equally apparent is that if Thailand is to avoid further involvement in Indochina and if Sino-American relations are to continue blossoming, the United States cannot \"wash its hands\" of the plight of the Vietnam negotiations.</span></p>"}

I'm emerging as the leading challenger to Ed Muskie.\"</span></p> <p><span>McGovern cited the Manchester returns as a refutation of the claim that his is a one-issue candidacy.  \"We're running strong in Manchester, which is a highly blue-collar town.\"  he said.</span></p>"}

You'll be there till the polls close.\"</span></p> <p><span>So I walked up four blocks from the \"Thrrriftee\" Cleaners McGovern Headquarters to the firehouse that was the official polling place for Ward 10.  Politics is a bad marriage; it treats those already won over like fools, and those to be won over like queens for a day.  When they thought I was a voter.  I was inundated with \"Endicott Peabody for Vice Pres...

Booths in lines of eight, no machines, with a fire engine and a real brass pole going up through a hole in the roof.  Around three o'clock they had a fire somewhere and the electoral process was momentarily suspended in favor of bells and high rubber boots.  The poll watchers mostly watched each other, and the people in charge knew every voter's name before he had said it.</span></p> <p><span>\"Endicott Peabody, running for Vice President.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Are you the same Peabody who was Harvard's last All-American and who used to be governor of Massachusetts?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Yes,\" and he turned to say the same thing to an old man who didn't understand.  There is a sadness about a man who has lost and doesn't give up; he brings out the same emotion as Ben Hogan skying to an 80 in the last round after shooting a third round 66 in the Masters a few years ago.  Only Peabody didn't have the grace of a faded star.  His over madeup wife in a shiny silver coat handed out sheets and said.  \"My husband's running for Vice President.\"  Meanwhile her husband was saying to the green-eyed McGovern girl that he'd be glad to \"chase your skirt anytime, honey.\"</span></p> <p><span>The green-eyed girl was from Worcester, a freshman at Clark, who lived at home and liked a silent German movie whose title she couldn't recall.  I took her picture, and she took mine, and we waited for candidates and movie stars to show up.  The Yorty lady gave me a button and promised that Sam would be here before the polls closed.  Sam never made it, although his red, white, and blue traveling trailer did.  As the Yorty lady stepped up into the van she shook my hand, looked at me and said, \"I'll never forget you son.  And don't lose those gloves; you don't find those in garbage cans, you know.\"</span></p> <p><span>Vance Hartke did make it to the firehouse.  He was preceeded by about five minutes worth of sound truck jibber.  \"Vance Hartke, author of such-and-such Vance Hartke, champion of civil rights.  Vance Hartke, friend of the veteran,\" and so on.  The name is strange to begin with, and upon repetition it starts to sound like a call to arms:  vance hartkee' The senator arrived with his chesterfield coat, one wife and three of ten kids, two of whom seemed absorbed in a 7-up.  The Hartke people all wore styrofoam skimmers and balloons, but the Senator seemed annoyed when one of the nats was put on his own head.</span></p> <p><span>\"How's the recount going Senator?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Fine, we just want to get it over with to show I have an even bigger margin.\"</span></p> <p><span>The candidate never refers to himself as I, and he never says anything is doubtful So \"we\" went to talk to the boys in the backroom of the firehouse, and meanwhile Shirley MacLame stole his audience outside.  She is quite beautiful, more so than on the screen and even her alootness was more appealing than a candidate's underwhelming warmth.  A man who is running for President is something natural, a common man.  A movie star is something entirely different.  She smiled dutifully at my camera and signed an autograph for the green-eyed girl, and was off without ever leaving her car.  Then Vance came back out, but everyone was gone.</span></p> <p><span>\"I wish those other guys would get here.\"  It was cold and the boy with the Mills pencils was suffering.</span></p> <p><span>\"This politics has no action.  I'm only doing this because they pay me and my old man says Mills is a strong fella.\"  He was about 17 and had no front teeth.  \"If you want action you should come down to the Guard Armory on Saturday and see the roller derby.  There's action for you.  They beat each other up, kicking with skates, they got women doing it, everything.  And they do real fancy ballroom type stuff too.  Roller skating is a real sport for you.\"</span></p> <p><span>We gave up on any more candidates, about half an hour before the polls closed, and walked back down to the McGovern headquarters.  The green-eyed girl and I got recruited to paint a sign that was supposed to say something inspiring like \"ON TO WISCONSIN,\" not something humorous like \"MUSKIE SUCKS,\" the man told us.  We succeeded in hiding it from the press, but it never did make national TV.</span></p> <p><span>That night McGovern came into a crowded ballroom at the Howard Johnsons after two hours of sweaty waiting and told the nation what all thus meant.  He left quickly, and hardly anyone stayed around to count the votes.

What they failed to show behind the spray paint veneer was the burial of the old containment policy ideology.</span></p> <p><span>The tronies and absurdities were all there, befitting such a grand show.  There stood Richard Nixon stalwart of Dulles's moribund cold war strategy of the fifties shaking hands with Premier Chou En-lat and Chairman Mao Tse-tung and reciting quotations from Mao himself (even if only from his poems).  Equally absurd to see was Chiang Ching, ultra-leftist leader of the Cultural Revolution and wife of Mao, flanked by the Nixons at \"The Red Detachment of Women\" showing at Peking's Great Hall of the People.</span></p> <p><span>Middle America was treated to a first-class TV farce.  The commentators nightly huddled together with nothing to say, waiting for Press Secretary Ziegler to bail them out once again with another vapid press release praising the Chinese hospitality the analogy of the week award was given to one clever reporter who thought that China was more intriguing than the moon.  But every one agreed that Erik Sevareid topped it with his continuous mane mutterings that the Chinese educational system was calculated to destroy the minds of Chinese youth.  (Sound familiar?) But the Nixons did try to show their appreciation Pat Nixon, dutifully fulfilled her material duties by falling in love with the children and the food \"I love Chinese cooking anywhere in the world but it's especially good in China.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>E</b>ACH SIDE expected some gains from the talks Nixon came to negotiate the basis for a post-Vietnam Asian alliance.  The Chinese wanted Taiwan returned And each sought new trade agreements.</span></p> <p><span>America essentially negotiated out of weakness despite all the media hype.  As the late Edgar Snow reported, the Chinese believe that the failures of the Cambodians and Laotian invasions led Nixon to recognize his ultimate defeat in S.E. Asia and of the strategies of containment and enticement.  With intensive \"protective reaction air strikes\" as Nixon and Kissinger's only weapon to assure negotiation credibility, Asians recognize that America's bombing policy is an empty threat--though a threat nonetheless.  While Nixon and Kissinger are banking on this continued genocide to get them out of S.E. Asia, somehow, short of complete capitulation, they realize that some long-range policies are needed.</span></p> <p><span>The Cultural Revolution and subsequent stability allowed the Chinese unprecedented strength and confidence.  According to B.U. Professor Ishwer C. Ojha, who recently returned from a month visit to China with the Committee for a New China Policy, China has rethought foreign policy strategy since '68.  In view of the notable lack of third world struggles and the failures of others, in particular in Palestine, Ojha points out \"there is now a post '68 emphasis on state to state relations through bilateral negotiations.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Chinese view their major threat (or contradiction) as Russian's encirclement.  Mao outlined the theory of dealing with major and minor contradictions in the \"Thirties with the United Front strategy.  Viewing the problem in terms of dialectics.  Mao's tacties relied on alliances with the minor enemy--or \"contradiction\" (at that time, Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces) to combat the major contradiction (in that case, Japanese imperialism).  This is the theoretical grounding for China's detente with America--a supposed enemy.  While American imperialism has now been reduced to a minor contradiction.  Chou told Ross Terrill of Harvard last July in Peking that Soviet leaders are \"successors of Dulles.\"  China's fear of Russia has led to a seriously myopic stand on Bangladesh.  They are seriously rethinking their analysis that Russia's support of India was the primary contradiction while the reactionary Pakistan government was only the minor one.</span></p> <p><span>Both the Chinese and Americans have shown a common interest in regaining ground lost to Russia during the Sixties.  Russia has stood as the principal beneficiary of China's diplomatic isolation and America's quagmire in Vietnam.  While China views the Russian threat in terms of encirclement, America's concern is on a more global scale commensurate with its wider influence.</span></p> <p><span>Increase of trade will bring substantial gains for both America and China.  Ojha received a clear impression from his trip that the Chinese are embarking on an intensive industrialization campaign in the countryside.  The People's Republic is now prepared to pay for specific industrial goods needed for modernization.  But professors Benjamin Schwartz and Ojha are quick to stress that this does not mean the Chinese are now going to rely on foreign trade to prop up the economy as was the case with Russian aid in the early Fifties.</span></p> <p><span>To American investors.  Chinese represents a vast untapped source of new markets.  One drug company executive summed up the American attitude, saying, \"If we sell each of them (every individual in China) one aspirin, then that's selling a lot of aspirin.\"  On February 14, just before his departure.  Nixon removed from the embargo list many goods China had shown interest in buying but which had been blocked by Pentagon objections.  These items included locomotives, internal combustion engines, and other industrial equipment.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HILE NIXON'S short talks with Chou only settled details of Kissinger's intensive negotiations of last summer and fall, substantial results were achieved.</span></p> <p><span>The Chinese obtained significant concessions from Nixon and Kissinger, most particularly on Taiwan.  These were a precondition to negotiation as the late Edgar Snow has reported.  Ross Terrill hinted recently in the Atlantic magazine that last July in Peking Kissinger agreed in principle to the Chinese demands on the Taiwan question.  Specifically, America agreed in the joint communique issued on February 27 in Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span>The United States acknowledges that all Chinese...maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China.  The United States government does not challenge that position.  It reaffirms its interest in a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves.  With this prospect in mind it affirms the ultimate objective of the withdrawal of all US forces and military installations from Taiwan.  In the meantime, it will progressively reduce its forces and military installations on Taiwan as the tension of the area diminishes (emphasis added)</span></p> <p><span>In essence America abandons its claim to any say on the final status of Taiwan and agrees to let this internal question be settled \"by the Chinese themselves on a bilateral basis.  The Chinese were generous in their return concessions.  Nothing at all was mentioned about America's defense commitments to Taiwan of 1955.  That China allows the old treaty to stand bails Nixon out of a jam with the far-Right at home already up in arms over what William F. Buckley has charged in his syndicated column \"a staggering capitulation\" on the Taiwan question.</span></p> <p><span>In this connection the Chinese have apparently quietly agreed not to take Taiwan by force (an extremely difficult military campaign to begin with) in return for America's public commitment to remove all its forces (a process that his in fact been going on since Nixon came into office).  The Chinese have also let Nixon set his own time table of withdrawal from Taiwan in conjunction with the Vietnam pull out.  This is the meaning of the phrase, \"tension in the area,\" (i.e., the War) as interpreted by Secretary of State William Rogers.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE PRESS played up Nixon's trip as a big victory--and in a sense it was.  He met the \"Red Menace\" head on in a tete-a-tete affair reasonably conceding failures of cold war policy and military defeat to the enemy and yet coming out of it all as the big front-runner for the November elections.  Once again he proved himself to be a true media wizard by his quiet, almost unnoticed, burial of the Dulles-Rusk containment ideology.  The basis of this strategy rested on a lie:  the creation of the fear that the Communist Chinese would spread their influence on a global scale with countries turning red like falling dominoes.  With this threat starting in Vietnam, it would surely reach the American shores very quickly.  Dullex continued to argue that it must be stopped at its inception--in Vietnam.  But in the communique both sides agreed, \"Neither should seek hegemony in the Asian-Pacific region.\"  So Nixon could claim at home that he solved the Vietnam war (in Peking just as everyone claimed he would), stopped the \"Yellow Hordes\" from seeking to extend their influence (there is no evidence to suppose that they had tried in the first place), and pacified the Dragon.</span></p> <p><span>For the Chinese it was an equally big moral victory.  Besides the return of their last province.  America agreed to negotiate on the basis of the five principles of co-existence that the Chinese first established in 1955 and have been using for the past seventeen years to conduct state to state relations.</span></p> <p><span>As a result of the renewed contacts with America, other countries have flocked to recognize China and establish full diplomatic ties.  Canada led the way last summer soon after the announcement of Nixon's trip, and earlier this week England abandoned Taiwan to place diplomatic relations with the People's Republic at full ambassadorial level.</span></p> <p><span>With Nixon's concessions on Taiwan in hand, the Chinese served notice last week of its legal claim to Hong Kong and Macao.  Using the same formula arrived at with Nixon, they are claiming that this is an internal Chinese matter, U.N. ambassador, Huang Hua, requested no U.N. intervention on the issue such as from the U.N. Decolonization Committee.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE SINO-AMERICAN detente presents the problem of new Asian alliances based on a series of mutual constraints on the part of allies.  This Asian picture is ideal for Kissinger's power politics manipulation mentality.  But for the present, allies of both sides fear sell outs.  The most heated cries come from the North Vietnamese and Japanese.</span></p> <p><span>After seeing China and Russia sell their interests down the McKong in the Geneva conventions of 1954 and '61 (which created a supposedly neutral Laos as a buffer zone to protect Thailand from North Vietnam), the North Vietnamese have legitimate reasons to fear another big power settlement.  Only Russia can protect them from a China deal, and only China can rescue them from a similar fate at the hands of the Russians.  The Nixon trip brought out anew all these hostilities.</span></p> <p><span>The Chinese have shown that their interests are not the same as the Vietnamese but that they will not pull another sell out.  Seeing the Chinese receive the number one enemy of the people of Vietnam and play some part in allowing Nixon to conduct such showy display to help his own political fortunes indicates the differences in national interests.  Also on the Taiwan question, Chou is letting over 8,000 American troops remain for some indefinite period of time even though 6,000 of them are used in Vietnam related activities.  Despite his recent statement reported by Prince Sihanouk, that peace in Vietnam takes priority over the final resolution of the Taiwan question, he is powerless to stop the use of the island as a staging area for America's war effort.</span></p> <p><span>Contradictions aside, the Chinese have essentially behaved properly as an ally.  On February 18, just before Nixon's arrival and on March 10.  Hsinhua (The Peking Daily) blasted Nixon's intensive bombing, charging him with continued \"global aggression.\"  In these statements as well as in the joint communique, they reiterated their support for the Vietnamese struggle and the seven point peace plan.  More important than the official statements was the Chinese refusal to discuss anything other than bilateral Sino-American problems during the Nixon visit.  Chou was able to convince the North Vietnamese in Hanoi last week that he will continue to refuse to act as any sort of mediator of a peace plan.  Finally, Ojha points out that the Chinese have done much to smooth out tensions between North Vietnam's allies and keep together a united S.E. Asian movement; for example, Chou's visit to Hanoi last week came at the end of Prince Sihanouk's three-week trip there and produced a successful joint communique reaffirming Sihanouk's position as \"great friend of the Vietnamese people\" and rightful ruler of Cambodia.</span></p> <p><span><b>J</b>APANESE-AMERICAN relations have also suffered at the hands of the Sino-American detente.  Japan, continually put in the position of following American initiatives, is now free to seek an independent China policy if it so desires.  But independence from the American umbrella is a step few of our allies are yet willing to take.</span></p> <p><span>The Chinese have shown signs that they would rather conduct relations with Japan, as with other countries, on a bilateral basis and not through America.  The Shanghai communique reaffirmed China's desire to see \"an independent, democratic, peaceful and neutral Japan.\"  Chou even went so far last week to hint that if would be a positive step for Japan to create a small self-defense military force.</span></p> <p><span>The Chinese have also sought better trade relations with Japan; for example, while insisting on negotiating on the basis of the five principles of co-existence, they dropped their long-standing demand that Japan agree to reparations payments as a precondition for talks.  On March 10 the first Chinese trade delegation in six years arrived in Tokyo to open a new round of discussions.</span></p> <p><span>While Presidential aide Marshal Green reassured the Japanese that America made no secret deals behind the backs of our allies, Japanese-American relations remain unsteady.  This new fluidity may epitomize the type of Asian alliances Kissinger sought to create by the Nixon trip.</span></p> <p><span>In total, the Chinese showed that it might still be possible for a socialist country to establish a detente with the capitalist enemy without selling out its allies in the process.  For America a quick trip to Peking or a couple of new alliances will not solve our deep domestic and international problems.  While Nixon might have gotten himself a better shot at reelection, he was pushing cosmetics and the Chinese knew it.  But at least he proved that he can sell even that to the American public.</span></p>"}

Muskie entered 118 candidates, McGovern 106.  The uncommitted candidates were mainly members of slates backed by Chicago Mayor Richard Daley.</span></p> <p><span>Daley's powerful Democratic machine appeared to be headed for at least one, and possibly two, defeats in races for Governor and Cook County State's Attorney.</span></p> <p><span>Lt. Gov. Paul Simon, a one-time rebel who now has Daley's backing for Governor, and anti-organization candidate Daniel Walker were locked in a tight contest which was too close to call late last night.</span></p> <p><span>Early returns gave Simon 167,785 votes (52 per cent) to Walker's 154,711 (48 per cent).  Simon was not polling as well as anticipated in his home areas downstate.</span></p> <p><span>And in the State's Attorney contest, incumbent Edward V. Hanrahan appeared to be the winner over Daley's choice, former traffic court Judge Raymond Berg, and an independent, Donald Page Moore.</span></p> <p><span>Hanrahan was originally slated as the organization's choice, but was dumped after he was indicted for conspiracy to obstruct justice in connection with a police raid in which two Black Panthers were killed.</span></p> <p><span>In other races, Republican Governor Richard Ogilvie was easily renominated, and Rep. Roman C. Pucinski of Chicago won the Democratic nomination to oppose Republican Senator Charles Percy.</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday's victory is important to Muskie since it represents his first solid victory in the first three weeks of primaries.  While the Maine Senator was helped by the presence of only one of his opponents on the ballot, his victory is still impressive, particularly in view of his nine per cent showing in Florida last week.</span></p> <p><span>McCarthy's vote was slightly higher than his supporters had predicted, but it is not clear what effect the vote will have on the former Senator's chances in later primaries.  McCarthy said he would stay in the race regardless of the outcome in Illinois.</span></p> <p><span>For Daley, the results could prove far more ominous.  A victory by Walker would mean that Daley's Democratic machine would be denied even a chance of capturing the patronage-laden Governor's chair.</span></p> <p><span>Hanrahan's victory, meanwhile, is not only a blow to the machine's prestige, but could be very troublesome to the organization in view of the political power of the State's Attorney's office.</span></p> <p><span>In related developments, 13 election judges were arrested in Chicago on various charges of voting fraud</span></p>"}

The women were polite and friendly as McGovern talked to them, but they immediately went back to their work after he had moved on, and they paid little attention to the bright lights used by television crews and photographers.</span></p> <p><span>We left before McGovern and drove over to Howard Johnson's Motor Lodge (where, incidentally, McGovern had set up camp) to have some breakfast.  We were eating our eggs and muffins when the Senator walked in with his wife and aides, also seeking breakfast.  He chose a table in the back of the room, next to ours, but stopped to talk to us for a while as he waited for his small encourage to catch up with him.</span></p> <p><span>We asked McGovern how he thought he would do that day in New Hampshire, and he replied that he thought he'd do well, better than most people thought.  We asked him about the debate on the previous Sunday, and he said that it was a meaningless exercise with too many candidates.  Then we all wished him good luck.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T WAS HARD not to be impressed with this man who was running for President.  He had been on the campaign trail for 14 months already and faced another four months of travel and speeches before the convention in Miami Beach in July.  We invited him to have some coffee with us, but he declined, saying that he had to sit with the rest of his party and go over some last-minute details with his sides.</span></p> <p><span>McGovern sat down at his table and some people came up to get his autograph.  He started to talk with Frank Mankiewicz, his national political coordinator.  As we left, Mrs. McGovern was holding the baby of a woman at a nearby table and talking about children and the recent birth of her own granddaughter.</span></p> <p><span>Later in the day McGovern would tour some of the polling places in Manchester to encourage his workers and sway any undecided voters of there were any.  As the returns began to come in over the television that evening, and his percentage of the vote rose from 25 to 30 to 32 to 35 and finally to 37 per cent, there was jubilation in the halls of Hojo's Motor Lodge.  The Senator came down at about 10:45 p.m. to make a brief speech in the jammed ballroom, thanking his hundreds of volunteers and proclaiming a moral victory.  He came downstairs once more, just to shake hands with his supporters in the corridors and thank them again.</span></p> <p><span>Then the McGovern forces went to bed, tired but very satisfied, remembering what David Brinkley had said in NBC's summation of the evening:  \"There are now three serious candidates for the Presidency in this country:  Richard Nixon, Edmund Muskie and George McGovern.\"  Even if it was unfair to Humphrey.  Jackson and Lindsay, nobody was complaining.  The next morning all would be on a plane on the way to Florida.</span></p> <p><span>* * *</span></p> <p><span>One thing interesting about travelling around New Hampshire was the slogan emblazoned on New Hampshire license plates:  \"Live Free or Die.\"  This is the state motto, taken from the Revolution, but this is the first year it has been so boldly displayed.  The alternative to freedom was perhaps in William Loeb's mind as he blasted \"Moscow Muskie.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Politics, Press, and Primaries | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>C</b>OVERING the New Hampshire primary was like watching a scene from Fellini's <i>La Dolce Vita,</i> where the main character was enveloped wherever he went by a swarm of reporters and photographers.  This is not to compare an Ed Muskie or a George McGovern to a Marcello Mastroianni but simply to illustrate the overwhelming role the press played in the New Hampshire primary.</span></p> <p><span>A particularly striking example of the omnipresent hoard called the press was the Muskie tour of the Manchester shoe factory.  The smiling Maine Senator, dressed in his gray wool body-fitting suit, weaved his way through huge barricades of incomplete shoes to shake hands with the factory workers.  The press, about 50 of them, invaded the building chasing Muskie down aisles, questioning workers about their opinions, and cutting off the campaign team to get local-color pictures of Muskie with the workers.</span></p> <p><span>One stocky white t-shirted worker provided just the quote the reporters needed for their mood pieces.  \"Hey you're a polack.  I'm a polack too.  I'll vote for you.\"  Muskie smiled, shook his hand.  The reporters hastily jotted down the comment and photographers clicked wildly.  The worker had made it to national fame.</span></p> <p><span>The hoard is far from considered a nuisance by campaign managers.  Without the aggressive old-style hand-shaking frontal attack of a Sam Yorty, who can exude his own magnetism, McGovern needs the hovering press to create the excitement of a devoted following.  Early in the campaign McGovern toured a shopping mall without a press entourage with the result that he had to wander through the aisles, a lone figure in search of a handshake.  A week later, surrounded by the press.  McGovern's appearance in a local Jordan Marsh managed to create the favorable impression of a much-loved candidate.</span></p> <p><span>Sometimes it became a little too obvious that the candidates made their tours not to elicit votes but as a gimmick for the press.  On one stop in a paper factory, McGovern's press following outnumbered the employees by about two to one.  Not only were the press overwhelming in number but they were not very subtle.  One plump middle-aged woman with a \"Re-elect the President\" button complimented McGovern on his lovely daughter, telling him.  \"I can't vote for you.  I'm voting for the President because I'm a WASP.\"  One member of the press chortled.  \"Hey, did you hear that?  She couldn't vote for McGovern because she was a WASP,\" he whispered loudly, evoking a soft but very noticeable laugh from his fellow reporters.</span></p> <p><span>Manchester residents got used to the sight of caravans of press cards parading through the streets in single file behind the lead car, made particularly noticeable when the huge press bus blocked crowded streets during rush hour.</span></p> <p><span>One of the more ridiculous such expeditions involved a Muskie walking tour of the Manchester restaurants at lunch hour.  First stop was a small, dingy diner where Muskie greeted a handful of eaters who were engaging in a frantic last minute effort to switch the fork from the right hand in time to meet the extended handshake of the Maine Senator.  After cramming obtrusively into the small diner, the hoards of reporters followed the Senator to the pizza parlor havens where, much to the delight of the eager photographers, Muskie ate a piece of pizza.  (All credit for foresight goes to the A.P., who had pizzas waiting for them which had been ordered that morning.)</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT MORE THAN just create the bulk of the candidates' campaign followers, the press also decided what were the major issues in the primarily issueless campaign.  Muskie was particularly aware of this.  When asked by a reporter, \"Do you think the funding question is an important issue?\"  Muskie drily responded, \"Does it really matter?  You guys make up the issues anyway.\"  It was, in fact, the press which catapulted the issue of campaign funding to a position of national prominance to such a degree that Hubert Humphrey announced his campaign contributors last Tuesday and Muskie agreed to follow suit.</span></p> <p><span>Of all the candidates Muskie was hurt the most by a bad press in both the campaign funding issue and the crying - on - the - steps - of - the Manchester-Union-Leader-Episode which was blown up to natural magnitude by such syndicate writers as Evans and Novak.  He was especially careful to be nice to certain influential reporters.  \"Hi, what are you doing here?  I thought you just stayed in your ivory tower in Boston,\" Muskie said smiling warmly to a prominent Globe columnist.</span></p> <p><span>And McGovern, who had only to gain by good press coverage, went out of his way to maintain contact with the press.  After the debate between the five Democratic candidates.  McGovern personally appeared to answer questions at the press conference afterwards while Muskie just sent his campaign aides.  After his startling 37 per cent \"victory,\" McGovern could afford to be a little less helpful to the reporters.  \"Now that he's a winner, he's no longer such a nice guy,\" a political reporter from The New York Times said after McGovern's refusal to have some pictures taken for him.</span></p> <p><span>Few people realize the extent to which the camaraderie and the cohesion between reporters from major newspapers across the nation affect the kind of news reported to the public.  After spending endless amounts of time waiting around for candidates, dashing around madly together to keep up with the campaign tour, eating meals together and sleeping in the same hotels, it is hardly surprising that the reporters, by discussing at length the events and the major issues throughout the day, should reach a consensus before their articles are written that night.</span></p> <p><span>This is not to say that there is some kind of active collusion among the press to warp the import of the news but that the day-to-day close contact between the top analysts of The Washington Post, the L.A. Times, the Globe, The New York Times and The St. Louis Post Dispatch should have a self-reinforcing effect on the perspective of the news analysis which differs from an individual that's-the-way-I-see-it approach.</span></p> <p><span>This was never more apparent than in the angle of the news reporting after the Sunday debate.  As a result of the press conference afterwards, where all the reporters united in asking about the same funding issue, and because of the communal press room where reporters from The Washington Post, The L.A.  Times, The New York Times and The Harvard <i>Crimson</i> all wrote their stories at adjacent tables, most of these stories the next day emphasized, you guessed it, the campaign funding.  The most original approach was taken by The Boston Globe, which had not remained in the press room after the conference to write the story.  This is not to say that one approach is more valid than the other but merely that constant close contact affects the angle of the news much of the nation receives.</span></p> <p><span>The closeness of the press extends beyond the limits of news reporting and develops into a camaraderie which expresses itself in small ways.  After the debate in the far-off town of Durham.  Don Irwin of the L.A.  Times went around the press room making sure everyone had a ride back to Manchester.  And Tom Ottenad of the St. Louis Post Dispatch offered to help three homeless <i>Crimson</i> reporters find lodgings for the evening</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Wallace Vote and Other Imponderables | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>G</b>EORGE WALLACE'S huge vote in Florida surprised a lot of people.  Everybody realized he was going to win, but no one expected him to take 41 per cent.  Candidate Muskie said, and many agree, that the Wallace vote is \"a threat to the unity of the country.\"  The Wallace vote obviously is symptomatic of a deep malaise on the part of many (perhaps most) Americans.  George McGovern said he couldn't believe that the Wallace vote was entirely a hate vote, and prefered to label it \"a vote against things as they are.\"</span></p> <p><span>McGovern is closer to the mark than is Muskie.  But what remains unclear is what exactly <i>do</i> the Wallace people want?  Do they want to return to segregation?  Certainly some of the voters in Florida would like that--especially the people in the pinewoods area of the pan handle who backed Wallace in 1968.  However, that wasn't the main support for the Wallace candidacy this time.  He talked a lot about busing, but not about race.  Is busing just a code word for racism?  It's not that simple.  The busing issue is not only about race, but also about neighborhood control, and the right to send your child to the school you want.</span></p> <p><span>Without a doubt, Wallace (like Nixon) has exploited the issue of busing for his own purposes.  In many cases, new busing plans for integration cause far less inconvenience than old busing plans which voters supported to keep the schools segregated.  It is fine (and perfectly correct) to say that socially, racially and economically integrated neighborhoods are the real answer to the problem of segregation; however this is to beg the busing question, since (1.) such neighborhoods are not being built very quickly, and (2.) some kind of solution must be found for now to break down the various barriers that our society has built up.  Beyond all this, busing is still not just a question of race (Only 21 per cent of Tuesday's Florida voters advocated a return to a dual school system.  This means that at least 210,000 Floridians voted both against strict segregation and for Wallace.) It truly involves \"the distance of the government from the people\" of which Wallace spoke so often.  Like so many other social techniques, busing is a way of passing on to the lower-middle class the costs of fixing the society.  The lower-middle class is mad about this, and rightly so.</span></p> <p><span>If the Wallace vote was not strictly a racist vote, what was it?  Some on the Left have suggested that the people who backed Wallace are angry citizens frustrated by their powerlessness.  This theory suggests that some day \"these people will be with us.\"  There is some evidence to support this notion.  Wallace did, after all, attack the liberal power structure and the bureaucrats, and also the people who make big money and pay low taxes--and the institutions which pay none at all.</span></p> <p><span>Sadly, this theory explains only part of the Wallace vote.  Many Wallace votes clearly had a great deal to do with class interests.  More 1968 Wallace voters identified themselves as working class than did those of Nixon or Humphrey.  But Wallace didn't campaign in Florida only on the issues of powerlessness, busing and the need to tax the monied interests.  He also spoke out against \"welfare chizzlers\" and \"communists\" and those who would \"sell us down the river in Vietnam.\"  Many of those who backed Wallace on powerlessness and busing also supported him on these counts as well.</span></p> <p><span>Wallace served not only as a means through which people could express their discontents; he was also supporting \"solutions\" which in fact would work to the disadvantage of everybody--and especially poor people.  Wallace set up as the \"enemy\" not only the liberal-bureaucratic-wealthy-power-structure which radicals attack, but also poor people on welfare and precisely those people on the Left who may revel over his victory.</span></p> <p><span>Our centrist political structure has normally excluded solutions to public problems which would significantly alter the distribution of power.  But the mere act of shaking up that structure is not sufficient.  Not every form of polarization is desirable.  Wallace's victory is something neither to rejoice about, nor even cynically to snicker at.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>SESSING THE practical political questions raised by the results in Florida and New Hampshire is easier than assessing the cosmic issues raised by the Wallace vote.  Muskie's disappointing showing in New Hampshire, and his disastrous nine per cent in Florida, indicates that he is no longer the front-runner in the Democratic race.  The winner, other than George Wallace, appears to be Hubert Humphrey.  Humphrey got twice the vote of Muskie and received heavy support from those groups which have been good to him before including old people, blacks, and Jews.</span></p> <p><span>Muskie's failures in New Hampshire and Florida are probably attributable precisely to his interpretation of what it means to be a front runner.  In New Hampshire and Florida, he refrained from taking strong stands on specific issues, and avoided attacks on his opponents.  As the New Hampshire primary drew to a close, he appeared to sense his problem, and issued several ill-tempered and unfair attacks on George McGovern.  In addition, Muskie appeared completely worn out even before he left for Florida.</span></p> <p><span>On the Left, meanwhile, George McGovern appears to have gained a great deal in these first two weeks.  While his chances of taking the nomination are still dim, McGovern is now the leading candidate on the left side of the Democratic spectrum.  Ignoring Florida, McGovern devoted almost all of his time to New Hampshire, achieving his impressive 37 per cent there.  John Lindsay spent all of his time in Florida in hopes of the big vote which would launch his candidacy.  He failed.  Despite all the money he spent (estimates range upward from $300,000) he took 6 per cent, only narrowly outpolling McGovern.  Lindsay, McGovern and all the other candidates will be in Wisconsin for the April 4 Primary, and it appears now that McGovern has the edge over Lindsay and maybe the rest of the pack as well.</span></p> <p><span>Henry Jackson's 14 per cent showing in Florida was neither very good nor very bad.  Wallace's entry hurt him, but it's not clear how much of the latter's vote would have gone to \"the Senator from Boeing.\"  Neither Jackson nor Shirley Chisholm (who took 4 per cent in Florida) has much of a chance.</span></p> <p><span>The next round takes place Tuesday in Illinois.  Only two Presidential candidates are on the ballot.  Muskie and Eugene McCarthy.  Muskie is likely to win in the non-binding Presidential Preference Primary, but McCarthy's backers are hoping to add anti-Muskie votes to Clean Gene's base of support.  Perhaps a strong McCarthy showing in Illinois will thrust him back into the thick of things, but probably not.</span></p> <p><span>Illinois convention delegates are also at stake.  In Chicago's Congressional districts, Mayor Daley's uncommitted slates will certainly win.  But in the other 13 districts, McGovern delegates, and some McCarthy delegates, are in contests with Muskie backers and uncommitted slates.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE DEMOCRATIC race is a shambles, When Democrats gather in Miami, there could very well be no candidate with a majority.  The party could turn away from those fighting now to seek a \"new\" face--perhaps that belonging to Edward Kennedy.  Meanwhile, George Wallace could pile up votes in Northern states like Indiana and Iowa--and perhaps even win.  Can any of the Democrats win over the angry and alienated Americans who have been cheering George Wallace for eight years, and now appear to be cheering louder than ever?  And more important, can they do so without appealing to racism and fear?</span></p>"}

He also made a pitch to the growing group of voters angry about busing when he told a WHDH-TV reporter later that his tax proposals would make busing unnecessary because schools would theoretically become equal.</span></p> <p><span>At the Houton home, one newsman asked McGovern if he was seeking to upstage President Nixon, who is about to unveil a national value-added tax.  \"I think Nixon's value-added tax is a disaster,\" he shot back.  \"It's another name for a sales tax, which is the most regressive of taxes.\"</span></p> <p><span>In scattered questions about his campaign afterwards, and in particular about a Boston Globe survey which showed him trailing Senator Edmund S. Muskie (D-Me.) in New Hampshire, McGovern questioned the accuracy of polls in primaries and said he expected to do better than 18 per cent.</span></p> <p><span>Edward T. O'Donnell, head of National Students for McGovern and now working full-time on New Hampshire at the Harvard office, said that his candidate has just opened 14 new offices in New Hampshire.

{"title": "Black Blood in the White House | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>he air these days is full of talk about having a black American run for the Presidency or Vice-Presidency this year.  A number of black groups have been meeting on this and related issues.  Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine recently voiced his opinion that a President could not be elected in 1972 with a black running-mate--a view he took pains to say he came to with regret.  Since then, Muskie has met with agreement and disagreement from both sides of the color line.</span></p> <p><span>Now a staff member of the National Opinion Research Center has proposed in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> that black civil-rights leader Andrew Young is an obvious person to run for Vice-President.  Sen. Brooke of Massachusetts recently said, \"The time is not far off when a black will be elected Vice-President, and 1972 could be the year,\" adding that he himself, the Senate's sole Negro, would accept the Republican nomination for Vice-President if President Nixon offered it to him.</span></p> <p><span>Rep. Shirley Chisholm of New York, the nation's first black Congresswoman, has announced that she will enter at least four or five of this year's Presidential primaries herself.  And a made-for-TV movie, \"The Man,\" to be screened later this season, starts with the premise of a black man as President.</span></p> <p><span>The most surprising thing about all of this is the widely held belief that it is new.  In politics memories are notoriously short.  Thus we find the just-published biography of Julian Bond making the erroneous assertion that Bond was \"the first black man in the history of the country to be proposed for the job of Vice-President\"--a claim that is constantly being iterated elsewhere.  The idea of a black President or Vice-President is, actually, far from novel.  And all the current discussion needs to be placed in its historical context.  This context has two main aspects.</span></p> <p><span>First is the series of claims that five Presidents and one Vice-President in our history all had some Negro ancestry, Thomas Jefferson being the earliest one so described.  As one might expect, much of this was just gossip circulated over the years with a view to alienating voters, especially those in the South.</span></p> <p><span>Those interested in this subject may start by consulting the evidence marshalled by the late historian-anthropologist Joel A. Rogers in his multi-volume <i>Sex and Race</i> and his later pamphlet <i>The Five Negro Presidents.</i>  Rogers was an indefatigable digger, and carefully cited his sources.  At the same time, those familiar with his extensive oeuvre know that he, a Negro himself, tended to be overzealous in drawing conclusions from his data.</span></p> <p><span>Still, it is possible to make a case of sorts to support the claim that Abraham Lincoln had some black forebears.  Rogers also badly states that Hannibal Hamlin, who was Vice-President during the Civil War, \"was undoubtedly of Negro ancestry.\"  This topic is further discussed both in the old biography of Hamlin by his grandson and in a new one.  Nobody disputes that Hamlin had jet-black hair and eyes, a broad nose, and very dark skin.</span></p> <p><span>The most persistent claim of mixed blood attaches to Warren G. Harding, and to other members of his family going back several generations before his.  The issue of his alleged black blood figured in all Harding's political campaigns, becoming most intense in the Presidential campaign of 1920.  The recent freshet of scholarship on Harding has sifted and resifted the evidence.  In the process a substantial amount has been clarified and some of it rightly dismissed; but there remains plenty to buttress the claim, and the matter is by no means resolved.  Harding himself didn't know whether he really had some Negro blood or not; and he is reported commenting to a friend.  \"How should I know?  One of my ancestors might have jumped the fence.\"</span></p> <p><span>Of course none of the above office-holders promoted himself as a person with a measure of black genes.  This brings us to the second aspect of our historical context:  the <i>self-proclaimed</i> black Americans who have been put forth for one of the top two spots on the ticket.  This is where people invoke the name of Julian Bond, who had already run up a number of votes for Vice-President at the 1968 Democratic convention when he took the microphone to remove his name on the grounds that, at age 28, he failed to meet the Constitutional requirement.</span></p> <p><span>It does not detract one bit from this impressive young Georgian to point out that his nomination was not the \"first\" so widely claimed for it.  We must go back just short of a century for the pioneering precedent.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>n 1872 hundreds of women's suffragists organized the new National Radical Reformers Party, and nominated as its Presidential candidate the colorful and eccentric Victoria Claflin Woodhull.  After pondering a half dozen choices for Vice-President, the convention enthusiastically selected a black man in absentia.  This was none other than Frederick Douglass, who needs no identification:  suffice it to say that Douglass was not only as great a black man as our country has produced, but also as great a man of <i>any</i> color.  Although it was at once reported in the press that Douglass \"will not decline,\" the fact is that he simply ignored the party and his nomination, and instead went about his business of campaigning vigorously for the successful Ulysses S. Grant.</span></p> <p><span>The election of 1904 saw the first Negro run for President.  This was George Edwin Taylor of Iowa, a one-time editor of several newspapers.  A former delegate to both Republican and Democratic conventions, he became disillusioned with the major parties and was chosen to head the ticket of the newly established National Liberal Party, which revived many of the principles of the defunct Whigs.</span></p> <p><span>But even if one looks at only the <i>major</i> parties, the nineteenth century beckons again.  This time we come upon a man who is less well known than he deserves:  Blanche Kelso Bruce.  Born into slavery, Bruce as a young man opened and taught Kansas' first grade school for black children.  He eventually became the first Negro to serve a full term in the U.S. Senate (1875-81), where he vainly fought against a bill to exclude Chinese immigration and fought for the rights of American Indians.  He was later named to important posts by Presidents Garfield, Harrison, and McKinley.</span></p> <p><span>At the four Republican conventions from 1872 to 1884, Bruce was a delegate-at-large from Mississippi.  In 1880 he temporarily took over the chair, and later was one of nine men to garner votes for Vice-President (from the Indians, Louisiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin delegations).  Had Bruce won the party's endorsement and history otherwise remained the same, Bruce would have become President on the assassination of Garfield.  At the 1888 convention, which Bruce did not attend, he again received some votes for Vice-President (from Georgia and his own state of Mississippi).</span></p> <p><span>From Reconstruction until the 1930's, black Americans over-whelmingly supported Republican candidates.  During Franklin Roosevelt's first term the pendulum swung, and they have voted heavily Democratic ever since.</span></p> <p><span>With the efflorescence of the civil rights movement in recent years, increasing interest has arisen in putting forth black Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates.  In 1960, the Independent Afro-American Party ran the Rev. Clennon King for President, but he received only 1500 votes.  In 1964, the Socialist Workers Party ran its first black Presidential candidate, Clifton DeBerry, who won some 28,500 votes.  (The all-black Freedom Now Party of that year fielded 39 candidates for federal and local offices, but none for the two top national posts.)</span></p> <p><span>The 1968 campaign saw the most activity yet.  The Socialist Workers Party, with Paul Boutelle as its black Vice-Presidential candidate, won 41,500 votes in the 21 states that allowed it on the ballot.  For the first time since 1940 the Communist Party put up its own candidates; Mrs. Charlene Mitchell, a black bookkeeper from California, ran for President (with a running-mate who was a dozen years below the Constitutional minimum), but got only 1100 votes.</span></p> <p><span>Eldridge Cleaver, the well-known author and Black Panther official, though then two years underage, ran for President on the platform of the Peace and Freedom Party, winning 36,500 votes.  Not to be confused with that party was the Freedom and Peace Party, which ran black activist Dick Gregory for President in a few states.</span></p> <p><span>Then came the dramatic nomination and withdrawal of Julian Bond at the Democratic convention.  It was at this same convention that the Rev. Channing Phillips was nominated for President--thus becoming the first black person nominated for the top-post endorsement by a major party--and received 67 and one half votes in the roll-call.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>nd so we are back to the prospects for 1972.  During recent months, <i>Jet</i> magazine, a black weekly, polled its readership of more than two million and found that 96 per cent of the respondents thought a black person should run for President this year.  Two names led the list by a wide margin:  Julian Bond (who will still be underage), with 30 per cent; and Cleveland's mayor, Carl Stokes, with 27 per cent, who nonetheless says he will \"never be a candidate for elective office again.\"</span></p> <p><span>There remains the Muskie view that a ticket with a black person on it is not yet electable.  In this connection, one may want to ponder a series of six Gallup polls taken from 1958 to this past fall.  White Americans were asked, \"If your party nominated a generally well-qualified man for President and he happened to be a Negro, would you vote for him?\"  The number saying yes rose from 38 per cent in 1958 to 70 per cent today.  That is encouraging, of course.  Yet polls are not infallible, and people will often behave quite otherwise in the privacy of a voting booth than face to face with a pollster.  Anyone who says that racism and ethnic voting are things of the past in this country is indulging in hypocrisy.</span></p> <p><span>Blacks clearly are nonetheless going to play a larger role in national politics this year, whether or not one of them winds up on a party ticket.  By so doing, they bid fair to acquire greater leverage than ever before--which is only just.  In his book <i>Nominating the President,</i> a scholar in the field, Gerald Pomper, wrote nearly a decade ago:  \"It is not unlikely that a Negro eventually--and probably sooner rather than later--will be named to a national party slate, most likely as Vice-Presidential nominee.\"  That \"sooner\" could well be imminent.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps it would not be amiss for the country to adopt a position close to the one allegedly voiced by Napoleon, to the effect that \"history is only a fable agreed upon.\"  Accordingly, whatever the truth of the claims summarized above under the first aspect of our subject, we might simply agree to say:  \"We've <i>had</i> a President and Vice-President with black ancestry.  So what's all the excitement?  Let's get on with taking care of business, with electing the people best capable of governing.  And there's no need to panic if we have black blood in the White House--again.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "WHO NEEDS I.Q.? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>To the Editors of the Crimson:</span></p> <p><span>We, the undersigned members of Adams House, want to make the following points about Mr. Herrnstein's article, \"I.Q.\" in the Atlantic, and the issues it has raised:</span></p> <p><span>1. The crucial sections of Mr. Herrnstein's article are to be found in the introduction by the editors and in Mr. Herrnstein's conclusion.  These sections deal not with science but with political and social theory.  As such Mr. Herrnstein has opened his article up to political as well as scholarly criticism.  The faculty statement in the Crimson unfortunately missed this crucial point.</span></p> <p><span>2. Towards the end of his article, Mr. Herrnstein states.  \"By removing arbitrary barriers between classes, society has encouraged the creation of biological barriers.\"  We disagree with this position as it is applied to America.  Working people in America are confronted with an educational system that provides serious education only to the wealthy; an army that drafts primarily the poor; a medical establishment that gives the wealthy the best health care in the world, while giving the poor treatment inferior to that in many industrial countries; a housing policy which permits the rich to escape to the suburbs, while forcing the poor to live in substandard housing.  Is Mr. Herrnstein going to tell the children of America's poor as they look forward to the bleak prospect of living their lives in America that society is removing \"arbitrary barriers?\"  In fact, arbitrary barriers dominate our society.  It is mistaken to think that if we accept this society on its own terms, these barriers will drop away.</span></p> <p><span>3. We are particularly concerned about Mr. Herrnstein's article since it comes at a time when President Nixon is making a major offensive against working people through such acts as his veto of the comprehensive day care program, his new tax policy which shifts even more of the tax burden from large corporations to middle and lower income taxpayers; and of course, his wage-price controls.  By giving the impression that we are moving toward \"the removal of arbitrary barriers,\" Mr. Herrnstein's article can be used to justify the social crisis which now confronts us.  Moreover, by applying the \"scientific method\" to social and political concerns, he attempts to prove that \"we are indeed stuck with the conclusion of the syllogism\" that we are headed toward a meritocracy.  Such a statement cannot avoid being political, and deserves to be criticized politically.</span></p> <p><span>4. We do not feel that a meritocracy is inevitable.  Mr. Herrnstein's syllogism is based upon an assumption of a viciously competitive and heirarchical society.  We need not accept the cynical point of view which says that naturally occuring human diversity leads to the extension of one person's power over another.  It is possible to construct a society which emphasizes cooperation and no competition; a society which embraces human diversity, not as an opportunity for one group of men and women to oppress another group, but as a gift which can be used to the benefit of all.  In such a society, human diversity is not measured but enjoyed.</span></p> <p><span>1.

{"title": "The Politics of Fence Riding | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>hen Barry Goldwater ran for President, we heard a great deal from liberal circles about the need for \"moderation\" in politics.  Liberal Republicans who fought Goldwater's nomination spoke of the need to appeal to the \"mainstream\" of American thinking.  In the meantime, Lyndon Johnson got support from the left by default, played consensus politics and won in a landslide.</span></p> <p><span>Johnson's victory was due in part to the fact that most Americans place themselves in the center or left segments of the political spectrum.  The landslide proportions of his win could almost have been the result of apparent collusion between Goldwater speechwriters and Democratic public relations men.</span></p> <p><span>At present, the centrist spectre is with us once again.  This time it is taking shape among Democrats who are trying to keep their party from going left.  If the party nominates someones from its left, they tell us.  Democrats will face the same fate in November, 1972 that the Republicans faced eight years ago.</span></p> <p><span>The attack from the center has taken many forms.  Toward the end of the 1970 Congressional elections.  Richard Scammon and Ben Wattenberg, two former Johnson-Humphrey advisors, produced a book entitled <i>The Real Majority.</i>  The political center is where it's at, they said, since most Americans are \"unyoung, unpoor and unblack.\" Street crime and the fear of young protestors are the most pressing issues on the minds of American voters in the 1970's, and politicians who fail to realize this will certainly be defeated.  LBJ moderate columnists like John Roche and Evans-Novak beat their centrist drums on behalf of the book, and <i>The Real Majority</i> enjoyed the peculiar American honor of becoming more than a book.  Like <i>Portnoy's Complaint,</i> it became an event unto itself.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he choice which the Democratic Party faces in the year ahead is essentially that of holding to the traditional centrist position which seeks to make friends with everyone while alienating no one, or of staking out a new position on the Left.  It is, in a certain sense, a choice between two poles set up by James Q. Wilson in <i>The Amateur Democrat.</i>  Democrats can seek to be \"professionals\" who see their main purpose as winning elections for the sake of winning and who use \"issues\" as means to election.  Or they can become \"amateurs\" for whom democratic politics is (at least in their own minds) a matter of public choice between candidates who really do disagree on matters of substance.  In such a politics, issues are not means but ends in themselves.  What is primarily at stake between candidates involved in an amateur politics is not the question of who can run the government most efficiently, but rather what the government should be doing in the first place.</span></p> <p><span>Wilson's <i>Amateur Democrat</i> was a study of amateurs in three American cities.  In 1968 America experienced the nationalization of amateur politics on the left.  Faced with a war they opposed, various elements on the left challenged the President.  They ignored the advice of the columnist and went to work for Eugene McCarthy.  The Minnesota Senator and former Benedictine novice did far better than anyone thought he would, and soon Robert Kennedy joined the race.  Both McCarthy and Kennedy built their campaigns on opposition to \"things as they are\" and asked for voter support for guaranteed job programs, guaranteed annual incomes and withdrawal from Vietnam.  More importantly, they challenged the existing American political structure by proposing that voters should be able to make substantive policy decisions through use of the ballot box.  To a large degree, they were saying that public policy is too important to be left up to the politicians and the men George Wallace labelled \"so-called experts.\"</span></p> <p><span>After the death of Kennedy and King, the defeat of McCarthy and the nomination of Humphrey.  American politics turned sour.  Americans were again faced with a more or less \"choiceless choice.\" To be sure, Humphrey and Nixon weren't exactly alike--Humphrey could have been expected to make better supreme court nominations--but their differences were less important than their similarities.  George Wallace's support in the polls rose to 20 per cent while blacks stood by understandably indifferent.  In the end, Wallace's support shrunk to 13.5 per cent as the American workingman perceived (probably correctly) that Humphrey offered him more bread-and-butter than did Nixon.</span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>any post-election analyses pointed to the large Wallace vote and the Nixon victory as a sign that America was turning right, that the <i>embourgeotsement</i> of the American workingman was making him more concerned about the destruction of his property and street crime than about maldistribution of power and wealth.  In fact, crime is a real concern for the workingman, white and black, and the fear of walking the street at night is generally more real in poorer neighborhoods than in rich ones.</span></p> <p><span>This said, it is wrong to look upon the 1968 elections as simply a swing to the right.  The race issue was not the sole source of Wallace support.  There was a strong component of class protest, of general dissatisfaction, among the Wallaceites.  While only 44 per cent of Nixon voters and 55 per cent of Humphrey voters considered themselves \"working class,\" 64 per cent of the people who voted for Wallace did so.  Moreover, 40 per cent of Wallace's supporters held \"manual occupation\" jobs as opposed to 36 per cent for Humphrey and 28 per cent for Nixon.  Finally, among the grade school educated, a good test for how the disinherited are voting, the swing away from the Democrats between 1960 and 1968 was only three per cent; the swing away from the GOP, 12 per cent.  This clearly does not represent a swing to the Nixon right.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, many Wallace voters were former supporters of Robert Kennedy.  They favor a candidate with \"guts\" and are unlikely to be enthusiastic about a centrist Democrat.  Certainly many of the Southerners who supported Wallace (and who accounted for about 50 per cent of his vote), are not likely to support a candidate on the Left this time around.  But the dissatisfaction of the more than four million Northerners who supported Wallace in 1968 goes much deeper than race, and this dissatisfaction could manifest itself differently this time around.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>here, then, does this leave the Democrats?  The candidates break down into three groups.  The candidates on the right--Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty, Senator Henry Jackson and George Wallace--appear to have little chance of winning in the Democratic Party.  In the middle are Edmund Muskie and (ever so slightly to his right) Hubert Humphrey.  To their left are John Lindsay, Gene McCarthy, George McGovern and Shirley Chisholm.</span></p> <p><span>Muskie has been under a great deal of pressure since the beginning of his campaign from the centrist faction, which includes the Scammons and columnists like Evans and Novak.  They insist that Muskie must avoid the \"lemming left\" in order to win in November.  Consequently, when Muskie endorsed the National Peace Action Coalition's April 24 March on Washington.  Evans and Novak criticized him for supporting a demonstration sponsored by \"a Trotskyite front.\" They even criticized him for speaking at a liberal rally in Providence.  R.I. organized by Allard Lowenstein.</span></p> <p><span>For a while, it appeared that Muskie would resist the temptation of the center and side with the more liberal faction of his staff.  Recent events indicate that Muskie has succumbed.  His \"New Beginning\" speech in which he announced his candidacy echoed the early 1960's rhetoric of John Kennedy and offered little of substance beyond a laundry list of the wrongs committed by the Nixon Administration.  The fault here may not be Muskie's, but one common to all announcements of candidacy.  Even if one grants this, however, the Maine Senator's recent pronouncements on amnesty for draft resistors and continuing aid to the Saigon government are even more disturbing.  Muskie told a television audience two weekends ago that he could not in good conscience begin to discuss amnesty while Americans were still fighting in Vietnam.  Moreover, he refused to state whether or not he would advocate continued aid to the Thieu-Ky regime after the withdrawal of American troops.  It would depend, he said, on whether our withdrawal was negotiated or unilateral.</span></p> <p><span>Where does this leave the Left of the Democratic Party?  McGovern has an excellent organization, solid grass-roots fund raising efforts, and forthright positions on the issues.  Lindsay's assets are personal appeal (which could cut both ways), money, and a campaign based on the theme of the average citizen's powerlessness <i>vis-a-vis</i> Washington.  McCarthy also has good funding, high public recognition, and an expressed willingness to challenge the Democratic Party in November if it again presents the American people with a choiceless choice.</span></p> <p><span>Rep. Shirley Chisholm is also making an effort to build a coalition of blacks, the Spanish-speaking, women, and the poor.  While her chances of winning the nomination (let alone the election) are very dim, her campaign is important as an effort to mobilize and organize an otherwise slighted constituency.  Her efforts in the black community could prove particularly important.  If blacks are to gain a real share of influence in the political process, they must set up political organizations which are capable of mobilizing black voters at election time.  Turnouts of all ethnic varieties in poor areas have been so low as to permit conservative machines to carry them election after election--a situation that must be changed.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>s for the three leading left-of-center candidates, their responsibility in this election is to raise the issues of the unfair distribution of power and wealth in American and to relate them to the specific problems in foreign and domestic policy which plague Americans today.  Their appeal must be aimed squarely to the 60 per cent of the American people who control but 30 per cent of its wealth--and to those in the upper economic reaches who are willing to recognize and correct this disparity.  For it is this 60 per cent which most feels the effects of an irresponsible foreign policy, an unfair tax structure, in adequate allocation of our resources for public services like schools, health care and public transportation, and the irresponsibility of private corporations which, when presented with a choice between higher profits and a cleaner environment or better products, have all too often chosen the former.</span></p> <p><span>By raising these issues most straightforwardly (and by demonstrating a greater ability to separate issues from personalities), McGovern would appear preferable.  On the war and military spending, his actions speak for themselves.  And his recent proposal coupling wide-ranging tax reform with a direct redistribution of income to the people at the lower income levels speak very clearly to the question of distribution of wealth.  This is not to say that Lindsay and McCarthy have not attacked similar problems.  Lindsay, for example, has criticized \"Washington\" for \"killing a day care program for 30 million working mothers\" while \"giving away four billion dollars a year to big corporations.\" And McCarthy has directed attacks against the centrist political structure for eliminating many questions from consideration in the political arena.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>orking and voting for left-of-center candidates within the Democratic Party is certainly not sufficient to bring about change.  But it is necessary.  For McGovern, McCarthy and Lindsay have all shown a willingness to challenge the centrist thesis at the polls, which is precisely where it has to be disproven.  The nomination and election of any one of them would represent only one step.  Independent organizations built around specific issues will still be necessary.  But a victory by one of these candidates could substantially alter the shape of American politics and bring us a lot closer to the achievement of a number of specific and important goals.</span></p> <p><span>There are those who argue that Muskie is \"the leftward-most electable candidate,\" and that \"the name of the game is to beat Nixon.\" In fact, however, Muskie has yet to be tested in an election situation, and the place where leftward candidates can prove or disprove that thesis is in the primaries.  Moreover, \"the name of the game\" must be more than to beat Nixon.  We can hopefully do better than replace a moderate conservative with a moderate liberal, even though the latter may be preferable.</span></p> <p><span>Richard Hamilton has written of centrist politics:</span></p> <p><span><b>Ironically, the \"end of radical politics\" in many countries may well be the result of a self-fulfilling prophecy.  The intellectuals supporting this view succeed in convincing political leaders.  These leaders, in turn, believing that people will no longer respond to traditional liberal and leftist issues, now stress other concerns.  The newly moderate leaders lose elections (because many voters no longer see them as standing for the issues that interest them).  The election results are taken as additional proof of the rejection of radical politics on the part of the newly affluent masses.  The response of the leadership is to call for still more moderation.</b></span></p> <p><span>This process will only stop when non-centrists win elections.  And non-centrist candidates will win only when their supporters are willing to exert the effort necessary to elect them.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Ashbrook Shrugged | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>D</b>RIVE DOWN ANY street in Manchester, New Hampshire, and you're likely to spot a neat and quietly handsome billboard bearing the words:  \"Ashbrook--Responsible Republican.\"  To the left of this inscription is a white arrow in a blue field.  The arrow is pointing to left.  Across the arrow is a bright red slash.  The meaning of it all?  \"No Left Turn!\"</span></p> <p><span>That, of course, is what Congressman John M. Ashbrook's campaign for President is all about.  The Ohio Republican, long a hero of the right wing and a maverick in his own party, believes that Richard Nixon has abandoned the goals he set for himself and the country in 1968.  \"Restore the '68 Nixon by voting for the '72 Ashbrook,\" say his supporters.  Specifically, Ashbrook attacks Nixon for going to China and selling Taiwan down the river, for running three consecutive deficit budgets, for proposing a \"massive\" family assistance program, and for sinning against the free market by instituting wage and price controls.</span></p> <p><span>Ashbrook is not getting too far in New Hampshire.  He has the support of ultra-conservative William Loeb's fabled Manchester Union Leader, but lately the paper has been giving more coverage to the fiestier campaign of Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty, a Democrat.  According to one long-time observer of New Hampshire politics, Ashbrook has given the leadership of his campaign over to the \"lunatic fringe\" of the state's G.O.P.  The polls give him only five per cent of the vote against liberal Pete McCloskey's 12 per cent and Nixon's 69 per cent.</span></p> <p><span>Despite all this, Ashbrook's campaign is very important.  The quiet and thoughtful congressional veteran is standing up for a rightist doctrine which turned on Republicans in San Francisco in 1964 and except for the organizational prowess of Nixon may well have given the G.O.P. nomination to Ronald Reagan in 1968.  Supporters of this doctrine are for an economy free from control and against power politics diplomacy which supposedly furthers American interests at the expense of our \"friends\" in Taiwan and Saigon.</span></p> <p><span>However conservative Richard Nixon's policies are--in the sense that they seek to preserve the present distribution of power in America--they are not the policies of the old Republican Right.  The New York Times pegged the President correctly when it editorialized on January 31:</span></p> <p><span>In its abandonment of outmoded conservative doctrine, the Nixon Administration had moved much more swiftly and thoroughly than did the Eisenhower Administration....  After the Nixon Administration's record, Republican candidates can no longer inveigh against big government, budget deficits, government subsidies, or federal regulation of the economy.</span></p> <p><span>The Nixon ideology is essentially the ideology of liberal Democrats of the 1950s and early '60s with a few alterations.  On the negative side, Nixon shows less willingness to prosecute corporations for acting against the public interest than did Democrats--although here the old Democrats provide us with no shining model.  He shows less respect for the civil liberties of dissidents--but the Truman Administration looked good only in comparison to Joe McCarthy.  On the other hand, he has broken away from the free market, visited Peking, and proposed the principle of a guaranteed annual income.  However hedged these moves may be, they are hardly in the tradition of Barry Goldwater--despite the Arizona Senator's support of Nixon against the Ashbrook challenge.  Gary Wills wrote in <i>Nixon Agonistes</i> that the President has become more of a reformist than a rightist ideologue.  His administration is proving Wills right.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>ND SO Ashbrook runs.  He certainly will lose and probably will not even make a strong showing in either New Hampshire or Florida.  This doesn't mean that the right wing is dead, but it indicates that many old right wing issues may die before too long.  \"It is true that in the course of history one after another political position drops from the scene,\" notes William F. Buckley, Jr.'s National Review mournfully.  The magazine is supporting Ashbrook because it still cherishes these beliefs which Buckley and Co. fear are disappearing, and because \"John Ashbrook has raised them on his banner, so that the nation is able to look at them at least once more.\"</span></p> <p><span>Ashbrook has made the elections--and more specifically the Republican primaries--a lot more important.  He has chosen the path of revolt against an electoral process without choices and against certain manifestations of state power.  For all these things, one must respect him.  But given the fact that his campaign is going nowhere, and that the scions of the right--Barry Goldwater, John Tower, Strom Thurmond--are sticking with Nixon, Ashbrook may be relegated to Herbert Hoover-land as a man who stood up for an idea even after its friends had given it up for dead.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HERE DOES this leave Nixon?  He has emerged from his old conservatism into the position of a Wall Street lawyer, concerned with preserving the <i>status quo,</i> but neither entirely sure how to do it, nor particularly concerned with the ideology of the means.  On one hand, he proposes the Family Assistance Plan and Revenue Sharing, but on the other encourages school resegregation and the Justice Department's trampling on civil liberties.</span></p> <p><span>Compared to Nixon, Ashbrook looks good in one sense precisely because the Buckeye Congressman is highly principled (or at least highly ideological).  The fact that he will do so poorly in New Hampshire is an indication that Rightist ideology is not now--and perhaps never was-- the motivating force behind the Republican voter.  Scratch a Republican, and you will find not the renowned old lady in tennis shoes, but rather the aforementioned Wall Street lawyer.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Entertainment or Not | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>P</b>ERHAPS FOR the first time this year, the Harvard cultural crowd will be giving the VD epidemic some serious competition this weekend and those diehards who insist on lingering around the Casablanca, Nini's Corner or--Heaven forbid--the House library should have their social connections severed and study cards mutilated.  First on the list of floor stompers is Harvard's 124th annual Hasty Pudding Theatrical.  The people at the Pudding are looking for a comeback, and if the magnificence of their effort in any way shows up in the final production, they should have no difficulty resurrecting themselves from the cellar of taste the 123rd show explored.  At the Loeb Don Bacon, assistant professor of English, is directing Luigi Pirandello's <i>Henry IV.</i>  This, of course, is a perfect chance for Harvard's highly touted C-students to revenge themselves on one of their professors, but if Bacon directs as well as he grades, there will be no need for rotten fruit.  Even the Varsity Hockey team might be getting in on the melodrama.  After last Saturday night's rumble, this weekend's rematch with Yale in the Boston Arena should be <i>El Topo</i> on ice.</span></p> <p><span>But the only opening that has a hope of making Cambridge a permanently classier town is that of the Harvard Cabaret.  Cosponsored by the Dunster House Drama Society and the Currier  House Committee, the Cabaret will perform Chris Durang's \"The Nature and Purpose of the Universe\" for its premiere.  Durang graduated last June, having gained notoriety, admittance to Yale Drama School and near-excommunication for his \"The Greatest Musical Ever Sung\" produced in Dunster House a year ago.  In his latest work, he shifts his focus from the Bible to a Weehawken, New Jersey housewife but continues to court Papal revenge with large doses of Durang's 50-minute play this weekend--at 10 and 11:30 p.m.  Friday and Saturday nights.</span></p> <p><span>THE SIGNIFICANCE of the Harvard Cabaret's inaugural lies in its proposal to go beyond this weekend and this month to become a permanent center for live entertainment.  Producers Vic Budnick, a first-year student at the Law School who did drama work as an undergraduate at Yale, and Al Franken '73--the man behind <i>Nixon!</i>--are looking for material and talent to carry the Cabaret through its initial Spring season.  Next weekend will have a musical retrospective with piano and clarinet on the work of Cole Porter.  Between shows there will be music and, if a way is found to transcend Currier House's nouveau-brick decor, <i>atmosphere.</i>  The Cabaret hopes to support itself by its cooking--the preliminary menu includes hot and cold drinks, chocolate mousse, baklava, eclairs and pastries.  With no admission charge, only the most miserly socialite could begrudge the measly fifty-cent food minimum.</span></p> <p><span>The Cabaret's most attractive feature for city slickers exiled to Cambridge is that it's not just evening entertainment, it's real <i>night life--late</i> night life.  You can spend those sleepy early evening hours at the Casablanca, at the Loeb, at the House library and still be in time for 11:30 show at the Harvard Cabaret.  If the Cabaret is successful--and if Al Franken knows what's good for him, it better be--it will be an opportunity for undergraduates to try out original material on live audiences.</span></p> <p><span>After the Harvard Cabaret has established itself, responsible citizens might want to check out one field where Cambridge still trails Princeton, New Jersey--dancing.  There is no reason that a University that lets its students eat oats interhouse shouldn't have a regular spot for them to dance on weekends.  After a week attending or not attending classes students who c-c-can't stand K-K-Katy's should have a place to go.  If enough people want such an institution--something even more natural than a macrobiotic diet--it should be possible to establish one.  The people are like the ocean.  They cannot be stopped.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Reality and Appearance | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>D</b>espite reports by the pilots involved that inclement weather hampered the bombing of North Vietnam last month, the President assured the nation on January 2 that the bombing had in fact been \"very, very effective.\"  Since the bombs appear to have hit school-houses and hospitals rather than the assigned military targets, Nixon must have had in mind some other definition of \"effective\".</span></p> <p><span>Clearly, the President wants everyone to know, and particularly his Chinese hosts in February, that he will bomb North Vietnam as much as he pleases until the very end, November 3, 1972.  In the meantime, recent setbacks in Cambodia and Laos as well as expectation of an imminent offensive by North Vietnamese and PRG forces in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam seem to undercut the President's bold rhetoric.  And, when Nixon is in Peking in February, the leaders of the Indochinese revolutionaries will be having a strategy session of their own in Hanoi.</span></p> <p><span><b>P</b>resident Nixon has chosen to mask his intention to stay in Vietnam until the end of 1972 in the guise of a question:  will Hanoi refuse to negotiate on P.O.W.'s and thereby \"cause\" the United States to maintain a residual force in South Vietnam\"</span></p> <p><span>But as early as June, 1970, when Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme spoke with Secretary of State Rogers.  Nixon has known that Hanoi <i>might</i> agree to release its prisoners in exchange for a fixed U.S. withdrawal date.</span></p> <p><span>Concerning the July 1 proposal on prisoners of war by the Provisional Revolutionary Government, Palme told Metromedia Radio on August 18, 1971, that his country was \"...long before the Vietnamese came along with this suggestion or this proposal--suggesting a solution along these lines.  It's logical because if the withdrawal of troops will take place anyway it's the prisoners who are very important to the American government and, therefore, if you couple them both you could achieve two ends in one stroke.\"</span></p> <p><span>Between June and September 1971, the Hanoi delegation at Paris frequently brought the possibility of such an exchange to the attention of U.S. citizens.  On July 6, a high-ranking member of the North Vietnamese Politbureau, Le Duc Tho, spoke of the above exchange in an interview with the <i>New York Times.</i>  Although he questioned whether Nixon would agree to the proposal, Tho specified that his government was prepared to promptly reach a negotiated solution.  The Nixon administration did not respond.</span></p> <p><span>On September 12 at Paris, Senator George McGovern told reporters that Hanoi would agree to release prisoners if the United States would agree to fix a withdrawal date.  Four days later at the regular session of the Paris Talks, U.S. Ambassador William Porter cleverly challenged Hanoi to affirm or deny statements made by McGovern and others.  Porter guessed correctly that Hanoi would not affirm McGovern's statement publicly, since such an affirmation would probably have implied acquiescence to the American-orchestrated, one-man election of President Thieu which was to occur in early October.  Only in late August had General Minh and Vice President Ky withdrawn from the presidential \"race\".  Thus, at a critical point prior to the October election, Hanoi saw no cause to boost Thieu's stature which remains even today at a very low ebb.</span></p> <p><span>On January 3, 1972, minutes before he told newsmen that Nixon had \"deceived the American people\" into believing that Hanoi would not agree to exchange U.S. prisoners for a fixed withdrawal date for all U.S. forces, McGovern telephoned Xuan Oanh, secretary of the North Vietnamese delegation at Paris, to clarify the conditions for prisoner release.  Oanh confirmed that his government would release prisoners in exchange for a fixed U.S. withdrawal date; when asked of the fate of the Thieu regime if the U.S. agreed to a withdrawal date, Oanh said that it was the best judgement of his delegation that Thieu would quickly resign.</span></p> <p><span>At the regularly scheduled meeting of the Paris Talks on January 6, Hanoi once again publicly linked the question of U.S. withdrawal with that of an end to U.S. support to Thieu.  While this statement may <i>appear</i> to contradict McGovern, the reader might ask:  why, after the U.S. had bombed North Vietnam for seven days in late December, should Hanoi publically appear ready to compromise and submit to the desires of the Nixon administration?</span></p> <p><span>That Hanoi has only once publicly confirmed its private statements--i.e., to the <i>New York Times</i> on July 6--should convince the reader that behind its public rhetoric at Paris.  Hanoi has another policy in cold-storage.  The North Vietnamese will unveil that policy when they, not Nixon, are ready.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>n the January issue of <i>Foreign Affairs,</i> Jean-Claude Pomonti, <i>Le Monde's</i> correspondent in Southeast Asia, discusses the political and military situation in South Vietnam.  Pomonti believes that South Vietnamese public opinion is not quite at the point at which, after a gust of \"fresh political and social turmoil,\" it will cast off its American-installed leaders in favor of a new regime that will truly satisfy its nationalistic urges.</span></p> <p><span>In anticipation of that turmoil, a new generation of leaders is preparing to take over the governing of South Vietnam, Pomonti writes:</span></p> <p><span>\"Whether President Thieu clings to power or renounces it, whether he succeeds in negotiating his departure (for example, in return for a ceasefire), or if he is turned out--in short, whether or not he is party to the negotiations--is more a matter of form than of substance.  In return, the police and military personnel of Saigon will soon find themselves once again faced with responsibility.  If they wish to play the leading role to which they claim to aspire, they must simultaneously channel and express popular sentiment.  Such a victory over self is the price for achieving a leading role in the new cycle which will soon begin, and in which the elite will be able to justify its existence.  If this does not happen, the current 'popular expectation,' which is still more or less passive, will turn toward those who will be left after such a failure, i.e., the only coherent rallying point:  the Vietcong and their fellow travelers.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>s the U.S. withdraws from South Vietnam, North Vietnam and the PRG have, as at Paris on December 8, shown increasing interest in the U.S.'s future intentions in Laos and Cambodia.  Given the overwhelming victories gained in those two countries in December by North Vietnam and its allies, it may be--as a secret intelligence report to the President released by Jack Anderson suggests but as the North Vietnamese and PRG have hinted many times at Paris since August 1970--that a de facto ceasefire in those two countries and perhaps also in South Vietnam will take place.  A process of conciliation and mediation <i>could</i> follow the beginning of such a ceasefire.</span></p> <p><span>Given the reality that the U.S. and its allies can no longer stop the Indochinese revolutionaries, Nixon will gradually turn to diplomatic methods to achieve his aims.  But the more he delays the decision to do so, the less likely it is that he will be able to arrange that events in Indochina not be a factor in the November election.</span></p> <p><span>Human factors may also overwhelm the President, especially in light of a report by Wilfred Burchett that recent U.S. bombing raids over North Vietnam have convinced Hanoi not to release any more prisoners before the U.S. agrees to a withdrawal date.</span></p> <p><span>In a few months, Nixon will have returned from Peking and the Indochinese revolutionaries will have ended their conference in Hanoi.  Indochina's future will have been determined.  Even now it is clear that unless President Nixon decides very soon to withdraw all of his forces by a specific date, the next year and future years will not be peaceful in Indochina.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Updike's Rabbit, Back in Brewer | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\"abbit\" Angstrom once yearned for freedom.  One night in '59, he went out for cigarettes and never returned.  He fled:  from a drunken, child-like wife, and a dank, frame-house row-home apartment.  From wealthy in-laws, and cloyingly supportive parents.  From the town of Mt. Judge, Pa., once greener, once marked by the men that lived in it; from the city of Brewer, its asphalt and industries.  He left a baby son, Nelson, and the promise of a second, unborn, child.</span></p> <p><span>He got in his car, and drove South \"... down, down the map into orange groves and smoking rivers and barefoot women.\"  He dreamed of his old basketball days, and his old laying-Janice-in-the-backroom days, and of making it with a DuPont in Delaware.  Then he stopped at a gas station, and found he was travelling in circles.  The stupid farmer at the gas-pump said:  \"The only way to get somewhere, you know, is to figure out where you're going before you go there.\"</span></p> <p><span>Rabbit knew the guy was half-crocked:  \"Everybody who tells you how to act has whiskey on their breath.\"  But a feeling of unease, of inevitable doom, sank into his gut, and he returned to Brewer.  Finally disappointed by a mistress too scared to let Rabbit get through to her, and slightly stirred by the selfless (if misguided) urgings of an Episcopalian minister, he returned to his wife Janice as well.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout <i>Rabbit Run,</i> Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom struggled; he still ran at novel's end, in a final gesture of revolt.  He was naive and inarticulate, and not wholly conscious of the implications his acts held for others.  But his faith in that single emancipating impulse was beyond his neighbors' compromises:  Rabbit became their conscience and scapegoat.  To his parents, he was \"the worst kind of Brewer bum\"; to his in-laws, the destroyer of his wife Janice; to his mistress, something too inspiring.</span></p> <p><span><b>U</b>pdike is an American moralist, analyzing the limits of living in terms of the social thwarting of human potential and dreams.  Rabbit was a religious hero in '59; his faith was ruthlessly transcendent.  Rabbit's talks with Reverend Eccles drew out his \"theology.\"  Eccles talked of Hell \"as separation from God\".  Replied Rabbit:  \"Well, then, we're all more or less in it.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Rabbit couldn't ponder the problem, only rebound emotionally off surrounding situations.  He expressed himself through actions, which, in the clogged Brewer-Mt. Judge landscape, made him incomprehensible to more interiorized residents.  His mistress never quite understood why Rabbit asked for a blow-job, or Mrs. Eccles why he slapped her on the rump.  But Rabbit had his reasons, deep-rooted ones, true to his sympathetic nature.  And because he was tired of lives too needlessly convoluted for direct personal response, because if we are in hell, we must build something to protect ourselves, and to build with the second-rate is to fall into limbo--for these reasons, Rabbit ran.</span></p> <p><span>In <i>Rabbit Redux</i> (redux:  Latin, \"led back\") we find that the course of a decade hasn't brought him any closer to what he wanted.  It has, in fact, taken him down a peg.  Angstrom is back in Brewer, working with his father as a linotyper (a fading breed...) in a print shop.  There are, of course, enormous differences, in Rabbit and family, in Brewer, and in Updike's own attitudes and approaches.</span></p> <p><span>Rabbit himself has transferred his faith from freedom to middle-class American virtues.  His is still with Janice and Nelson.  Though he hasn't had sexual relations with his wife since <i>Run,</i> and though he finds his long-haired kid (and his flower-child tendencies) frightening, Rabbit is doing what was expected of him; and doing it with devotion which surpasses understanding because it is so unexamined.</span></p> <p><span>But Rabbit is always out of step with (perhaps, ahead of) his times.  The culture permeating society in 1969 no longer shares his new assumptions.  Even in Rabbit's running days, America was not a land where the individual counted all that much, but there was still Jiminy Cricket to sing that \"you couldn't ask a waterfall to be a tree.\"  In <i>Redux,</i> when Rabbit and Nelson watch television, the Lone Ranger is mocked, and even Tonto involved in general degradation.  To Rabbit, \"America is beyond power, it acts as in a dream as a face of God.  Wherever America is, there is freedom and wherever American is not, madness rules...\" His belief is pure, and purely unreal; linked to a Calvinist temperament, it provokes violent reaction against newly critical opinion:  Harry is irritated that people think this country \"just grew here instead of people laying down their lives to build it.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>R</b><i>abbit, Run</i> was a quest; its sequel is a psychic Odyssey.  Rabbit ran from a variety of constricting consequences only to be thrust into quiet Eisenhower-era oblivion.  This older Harry (rarely \"Rabbit\" now except in conscience) plays the same role in all the conflicts he's involved in.  He changes internally more than the earlier Rabbit ever did; in <i>Redux,</i> he learns to live his life with a higher degree of consciousness.</span></p> <p><span>Rabbit has neglected to look to his own house as it changed with time.  He returned to Janice to do his duty; now, \"everyone's the way he used to be.\"  This is only half-true, and Rabbit eventually comes to realize it.  The freedom Janice and her new lover want they view as a God-given right.  In the broadest view, Rabbit is still alone in his innocence, in his determined search for some final causes; he must learn to embody his feelings in terms appropriate to his new world.</span></p> <p><span>Rabbit, traumatized by Janice's betrayal, first abandons his stoic straitjacket.  He is re-awakened to what Updike calls \"new areas of sexual and psychic penetration\" by a rich teen-aged \"hippie\" named Jill.  He is then confronted directly with the problems which have caused his confusion--Vietnam, racial strife, local revolutionary struggle--when he takes in a young black war veteran.  Skeeter attempts to give a metaphysical basis to explain social conditions--something Rabbit instinctively needs:</span></p> <p><span>There are two theories of how the universe was done....there was a Big Bang, just like in the Bible, and we're still riding that, it all came out of nothing all at once, like the Good Book say, right?  ... Now the other, which I prefer, says it only seems that way.  Fact is, it says, there is a steady state, and, though it is true everything is expanding outwards, it does not thin out to next-to-nothingness on account of the reason that through strange holes in this nothingness new somethingness comes pouring in from exactly nowhere.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>ut Skeeter's problems are not Rabbit's:  Angstrom can accept neither his nihilistic analysis of American history, nor the irrational fire of his revolutionary solutions.  Skeeter tells him what was lurking in the plumbing of America; Angstrom does not believe the sewer's backed up all that far.  \"Confusion is just a local view of things working out in general,\" says Rabbit.  Which does not imply that Rabbit returns to a passive acceptance of what's laid out for him.  He comes to grips with his life.  He accepts guilt for his own domestic mess, and (with his father) recognizes Nixon's guilt for <i>his.</i>  And Rabbit makes a life-deciding move:  fired when offset replaces linotype at his plant, Rabbit gives up linotyping altogether.  He talks of moving to a farm with Janice and Nelson (a perfect setting for a vulnerable animal).</span></p> <p><span>In content, <i>Rabbit Redux</i> resembles Updike's much-lambasted <i>Couples,</i> which told of Piet Hanema, a wealthier, more intelligent Angstrom type striving to build foundations against death in the sexually gymnastic but spiritually hollow \"Tarbox, Mass.\"  That's where politics made a hasty entrance into Updike's America; Tarbox couples coupled during Asian wars and American assassinations, forced to form their own secular groups partly by their total disengagement from those encroaching headlines.  The major critical complaint was lodged against the novel's bulk; its themes and symbolic framework, were not filled out with sufficient flesh-and-blood drama.</span></p> <p><span>There is plenty of that, and some melodrama, in <i>Rabbit Redux,</i> and the novel is every bit as complex as Updike's previous one.  The politics are accurate, and interesting; Rabbit is a wavering hawk, his cagier father a sort-of populist, his used-carlot-owning in-laws, fashionably lib-rad.  The changing landscape is vigorously perceived:  the social differentiations between tract housing developments and more wooded lots, plastic hamburger stands moving ever-closer towards the heart of the old city.  Dominant metaphors resonate with historical substance.  As Rabbit journeys, the theater marquee goes from 2001 to TRUE GRIT to 2001 (returned by popular demand), while Apollo II goes from lunar orbit to landing, to the dark side of the moon and back again.</span></p> <p><span><b>P</b>erhaps because Updike so meticulously spelled out his philosophy in <i>Couples,</i> he here leaves it in only where (as with the Skeeter-Rabbit talks) it matters.  <i>Redux</i> makes concrete a cyclical vision of human interaction.  Rabbit goes through a free fall which Janice endured, on her own scale, in <i>Run;</i> and as Janice then caused the death of a child, Rabbit's sodden neglect causes Jill's violent end in a blazing house.  Updike's characters change and grow with each other, spinning globes in solar systems of an inexplicable universe.  Is there no justice to these systems?  No, not in any Old Testament sense--the questions here are too variable.  We're all in a hell made dynamic by our own inventions.  Let's try to make it more liveable.</span></p> <p><span>What makes <i>Redux</i> exciting is, ultimately, the language.  Updike again uses the terse, present tense sentences of <i>Run,</i> the texture of the novel deriving from Rabbit's rapid observations, what he smells, and touches.  As the world crowds Rabbit, Updike's precision grows accordingly, down to the news stories Harry sets in type.  And, as sexual needs become franker (it is in sex that Rabbit's peers are as sentient as he), Updike's use of stream-of-consciousness is ecstatically successful, Janice's already-famous Molly Bloom jag vitally compresses an expository confession until it is touching in its revelation of character, and sexually provocative.</span></p> <p><span><i>Rabbit Redux</i> is a major achievement.  Updike's sense of irony and his empathic power have enabled him to portray a broader range of American individuals than any other novelist--without condescension, and with some hope.  The novel should be read--not only by an \"Updike audience\", but by the Rabbits and the Skeeters whose rages he expresses in passionate prose.</span></p>"}

{"title": "NRC:  Radicals for Greed | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>wo months ago, a group of 20 Harvard, MIT and B.U. students pushed its way through the Tremont Street offices of the Mass. Welfare Department, demanding to see commissioner Steven A. Minter.  The commissioner was not in; police appeared, and the demonstrators left.  Outside, they then unfurled banners reading \"Welfare Is Theft,\" passed out papers explaining opposition to welfare, and headed off for another confrontation at a second welfare office.</span></p> <p><span>Persistence, as the above incident shows, is one of the strengths of the newly formed, Boston-based New Right Coalition.  In nine months, a small cadre of right-wingers has wallpapered Cambridge with 1,000 posters, distributed 10,000 leaflets, and appeared on almost every radio and TV talk show in the area.  For a group with only 350 members nation-wide, such activities are feats of no small proportion, and testimony to the intense convictions of its leaders.</span></p> <p><span>\"We are believers in greed,\" says founder and chairman Don Feder, a third year student at B.U. Law School.  \"We are believers in self-fulfillment, and greed is the desire to be fulfilled.\"  Members of NRC maintain, as a result, a passionate advocacy of total liberty--the right to do, peacefully, whatever one desires.</span></p> <p><span>The group sprang from a dormant Massachusetts YAF last April, when eight of the most active and extreme members of YAF decided that its conservatism was no longer tolerable to their philosophy.</span></p> <p><span>\"YAF is basically conservative,\" NRC Mass. co-chairman Frank Peseckis, a freshman at MIT, explains.  \"NRC is different--its members are libertarians.  Conservatives usually have a lot of religious neuroses--ideas about man being God's servant rather than an end in himself--and think that the 'rights of society' take precedence over individual rights in many cases.  Libertarians don't--we think individual rights are sovereign.  We are the New Right.\"</span></p> <p><span>Disaffected Old Rightists flocked to the new organization, making up the bulk of NRC's membership.  The organization seems to be a comfortable nesting ground for former Young Republicans, Y AFers, Buckleyites and Birchers, suddenly turned libertarian.  Converted socialists and liberals comprise the rest of NRC's ranks.  But one common thread is found through all:  practically every member of NRC credits her or his transformation, and determination, to a 68 year-old novelist named Ayn Rand--the philosopher of greed.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>yn Rand has been something of a terror to the American Right for 30 years.  A short, thick-voiced, quick-tempered woman, she left Soviet Russia in 1923, made her way to California, found bit roles in movies, married, and began to teach herself to write.  Driven by a distaste for communism and a strong desire to be left alone, she finished in 1943 a huge, finely plotted novel about an iconoclastic architect.  The book--<i>The Fountainhead</i>--told the story of a man who dynamited a public housing project because officials had altered his design in violation of previous promises.  Despite rejections from 12 publishers, the book was eventually published.  It sold over three million copies and earned Rand thousands of staunch admirers.</span></p> <p><span>Fifteen years later she followed it with her bombshell, <i>Atlas Shrugged,</i> which has since provoked a divorce of the libertarian from the conservative right and made Rand into an arch-hero or arch-villain, to those on the right.  The novel portrays the fundamental issue of our time--and all time--as that of selfishness versus altruism, liberty versus tyranny, capitalism versus socialism.  She begins from the premise that man is an end in himself, and that his morality should ultimately bring him happiness.  The pursuit of happiness, Rand says further, is a selfish drive.  If one attacks selfishness as being immoral, one attacks human fulfillment--and self-fulfillment.  Her novel depicts the bitter consequences of attempts by society to deny self-fulfillment.</span></p> <p><span>Rand is aware that advocates of altruism and socialism say they are for self-fulfillment.  They maintain, she recognizes, that one is best fulfilled where one sacrifices the freedom to be selfish, and works for the common good.</span></p> <p><span>In <i>Atlas Shrugged,</i> Rand responds that if fulfillment is best gained through altruist or socialist systems, then rational men in free, non-coercive societies will choose these systems.  If they are not the most fulfilling, men will choose others.  The absolutely most important right to preserve, she says, is the right of choosing the system one wants to live under--and respecting others' rights to do the same.  When altruism becomes compulsory or socialism becomes coercive, she maintains, this right dies.</span></p> <p><span>Conservatives, as NRC points out, have generally found this philosophy quite unattractive.  True, it does justify individual liberty and laissez-faire capitalism.  But it does not leave conservatives justifications for dictating \"moral\" behavior to society, or enforcing Christian ethics.  Laws against most kinds of sex, more kinds of drugs, desecration of flags, pornography, gambling, breaking of the Sabbath, abortions, and free speech have to go.  Out of their distaste for diverse, self-indulgent, and non-conformist lifestyles, conservatives have rejected the sanctity of individual rights; indeed, many conservatives have equated Rand's libertarianism to anarchism, Led by William F. Buckley of National Review--who has written that when the state's good is threatened by individual rights, the individual forfeits his rights--conservatives have heaped abuse upon libertarian spokesmen.  Individual rights, to Buckley and others, are not sovereign--and the danger of Ayn Rand is that individuals, after reading her, might start believing that they are.</span></p> <p><span>The danger has proven real, to the dismay of the conservatives.  A New Right has emerged, largely as a reaction against the hypocrisy of conservative \"defenders\" of liberty.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he New Right Coalition does not rest its belief in libertarianism on moral consistency alone.  Through the influence of economists and theoreticians such as Murray Rothbard, Ludwig Von Mises, Morris Tannehill, and Edwin G. Dolan, the group has designed arguments for laissez-faire on practical grounds.  The arguments are, in a number of surprising areas, persuasive.</span></p> <p><span>Pollution?</span></p> <p><span>\"The solution to the ecology problem is simple,\" Peseckis said recently.  \"It is to recognize property rights.  Industrialists do not have the right to dump wastes on someone else's property.  If they do so, they're using another's property without permission, which is an abrogation of libertarian principles.\"</span></p> <p><span>By the definition of laissez-faire, then, the polluters are transgressors, who should be held liable for the damages they do their victims and their victim's property.</span></p> <p><span>NRC members disagree on means for assessing and collecting damages, however.  They agree that rivers and tracts of ocean should be privately owned, so that dumping wastes into them involves payment of damages to the owners.  They believe that air pollution can best be controlled by showing correlations between different pollutants and the harms they cause, whereupon victims sue the polluters.  Ultimately, though, their notions of the mechanisms involved differ, as well as the heaviness of the damages settlements.</span></p> <p><span>NRC maintains nonetheless that differing systems are possible in a libertarian society--individuals greatly bothered by pollution would set up ways of penalizing it heavily in their areas; less concerned individuals would handle the problem differently where they lived.  Of course, individuals would have to take the burden of moving if they disliked the system operating where they lived--but, as opposed to today's statist societies, alternative systems would rest on the consent of those living within them, making a real choice of life-styles and societies possible.</span></p> <p><span>Education?</span></p> <p><span>The other Massachusetts co-chairman of NRC, Niel Wright '75, described NRC's position on education as congruent with many proposals brought up by liberal and radical critics.  \"If you combine the ideas of deferred tuition, the voucher system, and performance contracting, you get some sense of what we favor,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>NRC believes that all education--from first grade up--should be divorced from state financing and control.  \"Public schooling, like most public services, is generally lousy,\" Wright said.  \"And people like John Holt and Ivan Illich are even getting liberals to realize that public schools have made our society too diploma-oriented.  By ending the near state-monopoly on schooling and abolishing compulsory education laws, learning would have a chance to become more efficient and fulfilling.\"</span></p> <p><span>Specifically, NRC envisages that most children would enter private schools with their education paid for by money their parents saved from school taxes.  Children whose parents could not afford to send them to schools would have the option of \"deferring tuition\" until they graduated and got a job.  Thus, in return for schooling from grades one through twelve, a child might contract to pay the school four per cent of his annual earnings.  Such a system--already being tried at the university level--has an added bonus; it gives the school an incentive to educate its students well.  The better educated and motivated the child, the more he will tend to earn, and the more the school gets paid.  A deferred tuition system might thus prove very popular even with families that could afford to pay outright for their children's education.</span></p> <p><span>An educational system not funded by the government would further offer great varieties of approach and encouragement of innovation, in the hopes of finding new markets, NRC maintains.  A parent and child could choose a \"free school\", a Black Muslim school, a military academy, and so on--whatever they thought best.  The quality of the schools would tend to be much higher than today as well, NRC asserts, for a variant of the \"performance contracting\" approach would undoubtedly be adopted by most schools.  Under the performance contracting system, the operators of a school are paid on the basis of improvement in children's verbal and mathematical skills--if there is less than the specified improvement, they are not paid; if there is more, they get bonuses.  When an independent testing service makes such evaluations of children's performance, the incentives to educate children well, NRC argues, are nearly irresistible.</span></p> <p><span>NRC's other positions range from complete abolition of welfare, an anti-communist foreign policy, elimination of the draft, drug, and sex laws, dismantlement of all economic regulation, and an end to the graduated income tax with an eye to the complete abolition of taxation.  All are fixed to NRC's central contention that a laissez-faire society, a society built entirely on free associations, is the most just and productive society possible.  Taken as a whole, their positions form a fairly comprehensive defense of libertarianism and the free market.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he reaction of other Boston-area libertarians is by no means totally sympathetic to NRC, however.</span></p> <p><span>\"NRC's philosophical tenets are correct,\" Juris Kaza, a co-chairman of the radical New England Libertarian Alliance, said two weeks ago when asked to evaluate the organization.  \"But their emphases and priorities are really off.</span></p> <p><span>\"Talking to some of them and seeing their posters makes me think they're taking the old anti-welfare, anti-communist line that makes them indistinguishable from pro-Nixon war hawks.  They should realize that their real enemies are not in the streets of the ghetto or in the jungles of Cubs, but in Washington, continuing to lead this nation in a deceitful, criminal, immoral war...It is the welfare recipients with bombs and guns, not the welfare recipients with hungry children, whom they should be worried about.\"</span></p> <p><span>Most other critiques by Boston area libertarian leaders are of a kinder tone.  Don Stone, organizer of an informal group which intends to counterbalance NRC by using little or no right-wing rhetoric, offered the following comments:</span></p> <p><span>\"NRC seems to have four problems.  First, the group has failed to make abstract issues concrete and real to people--it seems to have convinced no one that statism is a real problem.  Second, they have scattered their resources on a lot of different topics--Cuba, the wage and price freeze, taxes, etc.--and they would get much further by concentrating on a single issue.  Third, the organization's strong anti-communism is negative and distracting from the central issue of individual freedom.  Finally, by taking a hard-line anti-communist stance, they make themselves apologists for the army, the FBI, superpatriotism, etc., alienating potential supporters.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"However, at present, NRC has the most effective strategy of all Boston libertarian groups, due to the hard work and enthusiasm of its members,\" Stone said.</span></p> <p><span>For the public at large--at least the dominantly liberal public of the Cambridge vicinity--NRC's standing vies with that of the Mafia.  Hardly a single one of their posters has not been visited by angry pens of thumbnails, or ripped down completely.  A recent rally for \"laissez-faire\" in Harvard Square ended when street people drenched an NRC Revolutionary War flag with lighter fluid, lit it, and fled as pieces of the burning flag fell on an NRC member.  On TV and radio talk shows, more than the normal number of hostile listeners call in.</span></p> <p><span>\"But people are realizing that we have something,\" Wright maintains.  New applications come into the group's headquarters at 330 Dartmouth Street, Boston, at the rate of 20 per week.  The group now has chapters in 15 states and three foreign countries.  And NRC was recently invited to send spokesmen to a Marxist economic colloquium at Harvard, as the only representatives of a consistent non-Marxist ideology around.</span></p> <p><span>\"Who knows?\"  Wright said several days after the University officially recognized the Harvard NRC chapter.  \"Maybe the seventies will be the decade of radicals for greed.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Nixon's Escalation | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>P</b>resident Nixon brought the War in Vietnam back on to the front pages during the Christmas holidays by ordering an escalation of the bombing of North Vietnam to the highest level of his administration.  Nixon's escalation at this time indicates that despite a decrease in the number of American troops in Vietnam, the United States is still as deeply involved in Indochina as it ever was under Johnson.</span></p> <p><span>The bombing is the ultimate consequence of Nixon's program of Vietnamization, which has turned over all the ground fighting, and thus nearly all the casualties, to the South Vietnamese army.  With the decreasing rate of American casualties and periodic reductions in the number of U.S. troops, Nixon has hoped to quiet antiwar sentiment domestically while preventing the collapse of the Saigon government.  Because the South Vietnamese army is clearly unable to bear the brunt of the fighting, as the disastrous results of the invasion of Laos showed last February.  Nixon must have U.S. troops to do the job for them.  And the only way he can use U.S. troops without a politically damaging increase in casualties is extensive bombing of North Vietnam to hamper the flow of supplies to troops in and around South Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>However, bombing, even when most effective strategically, can only temporarily stave off attacks.  As the evidence contained in the Pentagon Papers repeatedly demonstrated, bombing cannot destroy the North Vietnamese potential for fighting and supplying its armies in the South because North Vietnam does not manufacture its own supplies but receives most of them as aid from China and the Soviet Union.  To have any long-term effect on the ability of the Saigon government to survive, the bombing must be heavy and continuous as long as there is any threat of a North Vietnamese offensive.  Thus, Nixon's Vietnamization strategy and the bombing which it entails spell a continued U.S. presence in Vietnam for years, if not decades, to come.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he bombing also means an enormous and continuous loss of life among the Vietnamese, as well as the Laotians and Cambodians.  With these most recent bombings, Nixon has now dropped a greater tonnage of bombs on Indochina than Johnson did during his term of office.  All told, more bombs have been dropped in the Indochina war than in any war in history.  Nixon has tried to sell the American public the myth that only military and strategic targets are being bombed.  He fails to point out, however, that because we are fighting guerillas, U.S. strategy considers virtually all of Indochina a military or strategic target.</span></p> <p><span>The continuous downpour of American bombs has rendered the Indochinese countryside bare of vegetation, and has forced the peasants who survive the attacks to flee to refugee camps and urban slums.</span></p> <p><span>The bombing also shows Nixon's total lack of interest in any effort to negotiate with the Vietnamese, whether the negotiations concern ending the war or merely the release of American prisoners-of-war.  Nixon's escalation will only prolong the war and place the future freedom of American POWs in jeopardy.</span></p> <p><span>The Nixon Administration has once again presented a challenge to all Americans who oppose the war and believe in total U.S. withdrawal.  We, as students, must not give the policies of the Nixon Administration the assent inherent in silence.  We must show our outrage at this latest atrocity through participation in demonstrations, support for militant actions such as those of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, the withholding of Federal taxes, and support for political candidates favoring total withdrawal.  Nixon's escalation of the bombing is a ruthless political act and the response must be political, not passive silence while the killing goes on.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Death of Political Idolatry | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>ith Bobby Kennedy passing and Eugene McCarthy licking his wounds, the United States, in 1968, was forced into a new age of political iconoclasm.  No \"image-maker\" can make much of what serious presidential timber we have left.  McGovern, who is the nicest of the bunch, and Lindsay, who is the handsomest, have little fire to offer compared to the heat generated by either the Kennedy or the McCarthy campaign.  Shirley Chisholm, whose personality is far more electrifying than any other candidate's, is unlikely to get the kind of money or delegate support needed to be elected president.  Not only do Democratic Party leaders doubt the political viability of a black national candidate, Ms. Chisholm must face the overt anti-feminism of male and female voters alike.</span></p> <p><span>I say we were forced into this age because, surely, the lack of inspiring leadership evidenced by either party cannot coincide with the people's apparent longings.  As one woman stated her case in the New York <i>Times</i> three autumns ago, after voting for Kennedy in '60, Goldwater in '64, and Wallace in '68, where does one go now?  The answer, it seems, according to the mood of the country, is an uneasy and remorseful:  \"Nowhere.\"  It seems there's no one to turn to these days but ourselves.</span></p> <p><span>Karl Marx would laugh a knowing laugh in the midst of our presidential campaign.  Deprived of an idol who somehow seems capable of transmitting a sense of purposeful unity and of moral social enterprise, longing for a human god to awaken us to our future and to make idealism fashionable, the activists of our country, the students of the first moratorium and their parents, the New Frontiersmen, retreat into despair and acknowledged political impotence.</span></p> <p><span>It is instructive to contemplate the few heroes still left us, \"us\" in the sense of the country as a whole, \"us\" in the sense of John Kennedy's mourners.  Certainly, it's for the better that we've been deprived of some illusions, stripped of the comforting passivity of political idolatry, forced to see the New Frontier and the Alliance for Progress as a sham, compelled to recite eulogies for the War on Poverty and for the Great Society, and thrust into the reality, again, of war's immorality, seeing the innocent we've killed and living we've helped destroy.  Still, there was some good in feeling some value in believing that we would grow up to join the war to end social injustice, in believing that somehow, for some reason, we were going to fight together toward an undefined, but better, destiny.  That much we had under Kennedy, a sense of our own sincerity, progressivism, and vibrancy created from a character we, ourselves, molded for Kennedy.</span></p> <p><span>Marx's chiding would focus on the crucial point in America's accelerated spirited decline:  people must run the political process themselves.  It cannot be separated from their material lives; it must not be an abstraction, but a reality for each individual.</span></p> <p><span>In our removal from real politics, our distance from the activity of community organization, we are forced to find in one man, one image, the qualities we each know we should pursue individually.</span></p> <p><span>As Tocqueville wrote in the 1830's, an electorate severed from the workings of its government surely can't be expected to choose its leaders wisely.  When no idealistic projection is possible, we continue to ignore the potential, salvation that lies in our talents, in human resources.  Rather, we, the activists, despair.</span></p> <p><span>Americans despair not only because they are removed from the political process, but also because they are basically alienated from their material lives, from the process of production and from industrial enterprise.  Work seems like drudgery, like misery and a hardship whose central object is the sanctification of leisure.  We lend no credence to our own stated goals, feel no control over our own day to day activity, sense real estrangement between ourselves and those with whom we work, and atrophy while feeling that there is something else we should be doing if only we could define it.  It is our distrust of ourselves that leads us to look for leadership elsewhere; it's because we are alienated from the people closest to us that leadership must come from a distant figure.  Hence, we continue to pick our glorified candidates, mortals upon whom we bestow an imagined \"gift of grace.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>II</b></span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>t is a reality of the power structure in the United States today that, besides the means of production themselves, the trappings of power--money, prestige, and access to the mass media--are concentrated in a few hands.  While this concentration of power is a target for resistance regardless of who is pulling the strings, the figure of the string-puller does make a difference.  For instance, activists are clearly better off under a Ramsey Clark than a John Mitchell, and this has nothing to do with seeing in Ramsey Clark an imaginary radicalism or a mysterious saving power.</span></p> <p><span>There are two reasons for political preferences of this sort.  While progressives may forestall better than reactionaries the economic collapse that appears a prerequisite to fundamental social change, they will make it easier for dissent to coexist with ruling class practice and enable organizers and writers to expand popular consciousness in relative political freedom.  Indeed, their inability to resolve fundamental economic contradictions may appear to the people as the strongest argument possible for restructuring the economic, social, and political orders.</span></p> <p><span>Secondly, they will not do the consciously inhuman things that conservative, self-consciously business-oriented administrations might.  While their practice will inevitably full short of their preaching, liberal activists will at least preach many of the right things and begin, in a small way, to make the right kinds of human sentiment fashionable.</span></p> <p><span>In this light, the case of Dr. Daniel Ellsberg '52 is particularly unusual he is something of an archetype <i>par excellence</i> for the sort of interim activist leader we have described.  His admitted role in helping to circulate <i>The Pentagon Papers</i> strikes a few themes central to the current American crisis.</span></p> <p><span>We must begin, as with the Kennedys, by emphasizing what Daniel Ellsberg is not.  While he stands under indictment and may go to trial and while, regardless of the outcome, he is unlikely to be put on Pentagon projects again, he has made a relatively small sacrifice in material terms.  Any prestige accorded him by the conservative or moderate establishment is now extended ten times over by the liberal establishment and by his younger audiences.  He claims to have withdrawn his intelligence from the service of power, but we do not know--as, in fact, Ellsberg may not--what his position would be under a McGovern administration.  For example, would he not be the ideal candidate for a McGovern National Security Council?</span></p> <p><span>It would be wrong to underemphasize new injustices Ellsberg faces--from having his phone tapped to being a police target at demonstrations.  However, he is not likely to have to go hungry either, and, in our admiration for his obvious courage, we must steer clear of dressing him in robes borrowed from our romantic memories of John or Robert Kennedy.</span></p> <p><span>This is not to call Dr. Ellsberg hypocritical.  Speaking here at Harvard last November 17, he admitted his own uncertainty about the meaning of his new role.  Perhaps, he suggests, he is unwittingly serving the administration's cause.  After all, he once thought the war was right.  Can he be absolutely certain of the rightness of his new stance?</span></p> <p><span>We thus wish to prevent the enshrining of Dr. Ellsberg, but we do not deny his achievement, nor the value of his advocating resistance, nor his suitability, in many ways, as a role-model for young activists.  His action was clearly inspiring and unites three themes of the American crisis.  The themes are confession, sacrifice, and initiative.</span></p> <p><span>Almost more inspiring than the release of the Pentagon Papers is Dr. Ellsberg's confession that, having passed the age of 40, he found he had wasted his life.  Such an admission to one's self, much less to an admiring audience, is an act of courage; one must not forget the years of effort Daniel Ellsberg had endured in validating his passport to the circle of corrupt power.  A Harvard man, a former member of the <i>Crimson</i> and a president of the Advocate, a successful fellow of the Center for International Affairs, and currently a research fellow further up the Charles, at MIT, Ellsberg has been consultant to Henry Kissinger '50 and director of the 1969 Rand Project for the development of alternative plans for Vietnam which were presented to the National Security Council.  Still, he saw his energy and intellect employed for wasteful, immoral, and inhuman ends.  For any figure now in power who helped foster the Vietnam catastrophe, this recognition is the first step towards liberation; in order to create a future, one must first face up to his past.</span></p> <p><span>Ellsberg's sacrifice has already been mentioned.  There is, we must realize, no particular certainly that a McGovern-like president will come to power soon.  There is no skirting the fact that Ellsberg may go to jail.  Clearly, he's foresworn large categories of lucrative government work.  Finally, the adulation of student crowds is notoriously short-lived.  If he gave up nothing else, Ellsberg at least gave up security for pressure, certainly for uncertainty.  For the time being, at least, he has given up the vagaries of academic freedom for the burden of academic responsibility.  That seems like little to outsiders, but to an entrenched academic such sacrifice is enormous.  We should not ignore, not only what Ellsberg has given up, but what he certainly could have had.  The \"rewards\" at the center of the web of power would have been considerable.</span></p> <p><span>A final theme is initiative.  It is somehow fitting that only by committing what may prove to be a felony could Ellsberg help release the documented truth of an immoral, unjust, and illegally pursued war.  For 26 years, America has supported an increasingly intense display of inhumanity.  Only civil disobedience could reveal the facts of our involvement to the public, facts which, unsurprisingly, are still denied in much public reaction to the Pentagon Papers.</span></p> <p><span>Here is a measure not only of the initiative required to get at the truth, but also of the basis for the effort required to get the truth acknowledged.  The American public is so removed from political decision-making that the truth could be denied them for two and a half decades.  Nixon did not judge his constituency unperceptively in invading Laos on a weekend when football scores dominated the headlines.  Nixon relies on the gap between the people and the center of power.  Covering up the consequential alienation becomes his most difficult task.</span></p> <p><span>There is another motif running through the Ellsberg affair, the motif of the Harvard Man, of intelligence delivered in the service of power.  Ellsberg stepped forward and removed himself from the past; while not absolving himself of guilt, he at least has attempted repentence.  It is better that he should self-consciously but actively atone than atrophy amidst his own regrets.</span></p> <p><span>Now, what about the men to whom Ellsberg gave service?  What about the men who helped fashion the Vietman quagmire?  What about the Kennedys, Bundy, and Kissinger, <i>et al?</i>  Does their involvement in the war have something to indicate about Harvard?</span></p> <p><span>Is Harvard's apparent role in directing the war an innocent string of striking coincidences, or does Harvard actively prevent potential activists and resisters like Ellsberg from stepping out of the web of power?  Does Harvard suppress confession?  Does Harvard ignore sacrifice?  Does Harvard repress initiative?  What could resistance mean in the context of Harvard?  Why does alienation, rather than activism, dominate the life of this university?</span></p> <p><span><b>III</b></span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>arvard now has four vice-presidents whose combined salaries would pay off the undergraduate housing debt.  The administration has attempted to charge rent to the wives of house tutors, and has considered charging rent to the tutors themselves.  The costs of the building projects undertaken by Harvard (e.g., the science center) have risen astronomically, while the uses of these buildings have been called increasingly into question.  Meanwhile, Phillips Brooks House, which serves high school students, disadvantaged youngsters, prisoners, and minority communities in the Cambridge-Boston area is scraping for money.  All this is accompanied by skyrocketing tuition and the administration's refusal to relieve that burden with Yale plan-type loans.</span></p> <p><span>These are only a few of the more tangible issues.  One also might contemplate the dubious legitimacy of the CRR as now constituted, Harvard's failure to act decisively on educational policy reform, and the adoption of 2.5 to 1 as an acceptable level of sexual equality.  There is no shortage of debatable issues and no-evidence of effective popular debate.  Do undergraduates enjoy being manipulated, or may we assume that something deeper underlies a prevailing malaise?</span></p> <p><span>It is remarkable that a university in which government is invariably one of the top three concentrations by enrollment has no student-organized body to collectively act on the undergraduates' behalf.  The unremarkable reason for this phenomenon is the suspicion on the part of a great number of the students that any such union would be taken over by young men and women on the rise, undergrads who, through conciliation and compromise, would hope to prime themselves for future office in the \"real world\" of opportunism and hypocrisy.  No one willingly subscribes to the legitimacy of such representation.</span></p> <p><span>However, there is a deeper implication expressed in such suspicions.  Those who raise these objections to student unions apparently expect that they, themselves, would not stop a takeover by opportunists.  Either they suspect their own unwillingness or inability to make the effort, or they believe that not enough individuals will feel as strongly as they to make a united and effective stand.  No one believes he or she will take on the burden, and, consequently, no one believes anyone else will shoulder it either.</span></p> <p><span>Now, the basis of these doubts appears more clearly.  We Harvard men and women--indeed, all American students--despite the endless resources at our disposal, have been educated to respond to the social system passively or to participate only in support of traditional goals which, of course, results in much the same thing.</span></p> <p><span>High school education tells us to sit back and learn while some authority outside us teaches us something for some reason we are not to comprehend.  Political parties urge us to cast our votes one day and to get out of the way the next, while party leaders and candidates run our communities and our country.  The corporate model reminds us that we each have our place, our aiche in the process, while those above our niche determine the frontiers of our decision-making and we provide the same constraints for those who, to their misfortune, remain below us.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard University, in the condescending style of Richard Nixon, repeats every day--in its bureaucratic administration, in its hierarchy of scholars (leaving undergraduates at the bottom, of course), in its undefined defense of \"academic freedom\" and of the \"sanctity of the university\"--one single theme, one single idea.  The idea is that Someone Knows Something that We Don't.  If We sit back and listen, maybe Someday We will be Someone, too.  Such absurdity reaches even the trivial level.  For example, Buildings and Grounds responded negatively to a student wanting to paint his own suite; \"The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will decide the colors of the rooms!\"</span></p> <p><span>Harvard students are now powerless to effect real policy change.  Most are infused with a sense of meaninglessness, with a sense that whatever we're doing helps no one, including ourselves, and that each person is more interested in the preservation of his or her ego than in his or her contribution to the community.  This is not an indictment of Harvard students <i>per se;</i> it is a sketch of the spirit of American society today, a spirit resulting from the deliberate, persistent attempt to preserve the economic, social and political <i>status quo</i> at all costs.</span></p> <p><span>People at Harvard are unusually good targets for a campaign in support of passivity.  Like Dr. Ellsberg, we have the most valuable interests to protect.  Like Dr. Ellsberg, we have the most sins to confess.  Like Dr. Ellsberg, we would have to take drastic initiative to break loose, even to preserve an academic integrity in an institution whose social attitudes often grow from nineteenth century intellectual seeds.</span></p> <p><span>The trouble is that throughout our lives, we shall never leave our particularly dangerous perch.  Not only are we alienated among ourselves, not only are we searching for leadership outside ourselves, but we are part of a system of other expectations that looks to us to provide leadership for the rest of the nation.  We are supposed to plan wars.  We are supposed to defend law and order.  We are supposed to be active sentries in support of policies and ideals we are not to actively question.  We will be paid well for our trouble.</span></p> <p><span>Those of us who feel alienated from our political environment thus despair, retreat, reject, and disapprove.  Those who feel at home in these surroundings do plan wars and plot their paths to corporate presidencies and material riches.</span></p> <p><span>There is the minority, working on a community level, which tries to raise the level of awareness among students and faculty to the point where those who have power will join to help save all of us.  To win even that interim power, however, there must be more who work, more who insist on making the political process a part of their lives and the welfare of the community their self-conscious self-interest as well.</span></p> <p><span>If we can afford to be elitist about anything, we do have one dangerous irony to ourselves:  because we are at an institution like Harvard, we are the most able to effect change through power in society, and the most likely because of our background to preserve the <i>status quo.</i></span></p> <p><span>We can choose our idols, or we can step out of the web.  We can create more mythology, or we can steal more truth.  Resistance is no more than a daily responsibility, no more than the effort to make community life one's own.  Blocking our resistance is the inertia of an alienating past and a society predicated on our submission to impersonal, frequently inhuman, authority.  We have left Bobby and Eugene behind us; when we turn to each other is yet to be seen</span></p>"}
{"title": "Revolution and Other Fantasies | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>n <i>Without Marx or Jesus,</i> a <i>Succes de scandale</i> in France and a best seller stateside, Jean-Francois Revel proposes that America owns an exclusive option on the Age of Aquarius.  But his flaccid prose, chaotic presentation, and unsupported generalizations fail to convince me.  After rejecting the idea of America as a fascist and imperialist state, he ends up creating an equally far-fetched image.  He tries to prove that the United States possess all the necessary preconditions for the world revolution:  an obsession with modernity, unrestricted access to information, and an army of radical crusaders.  Along the way he solemnly proclaims the true saving graces of mankind:  world government, unlimited mass media, and technology, but he can't quite explain their unique significance.  Unfortunately, he doesn't succeed in sustaining the rest of his argument either.</span></p> <p><span>Mary McCarthy, grande dame of the old American left, assures us in the afterward that Revel is only a pamphleteer.  Recognizing this we can all chuckle indulgently at his excesses and inadequacies.  After all, he exploits them in the name of the polemic.  But petty Gallic charm cannot substantiate his vision.</span></p> <p><span>By defining revolution so that most countries are eliminated, he hurdles some of his arguments major inadequacies.  First he dismisses ferment in the rest of the world with some biased sleight of hand.  He rejects the African nations because they seek out their non-colonial heritage.  Therefore they are inevitably counter-revolutionary.  He discounts the People's Republic of China as an irrelevant agrarian nation.  For Revel political democracy is absolutely essential, economic equality relatively unimportant.  Socialist states, including anything from Sweden to the Soviet Union, disqualify themselves because they are anti-democratic one way streets.  He considers Western Europe culturally unimaginative and ideologically misdirected.</span></p> <p><span>Revel's elusive rhetorical techniques prohibit refutation of his conclusions.  Because he claims his arguments are intuitively obvious, his sloppy syllogisms cannot support controversy.  He has found a disconcerting way of stating his views at the start of a chapter, and then discussing whatever occurs to him.  Suddenly the word \"therefore\" appears, and Revel blithely announces he has made his point and he claims only foolish French leftists would disagree.  I suppose this tone is meant to be audacious and amusing, but I did not laugh.</span></p> <p><span>As Revel rumbles on his major interest emerges:  France is what concerns him, especially the complacent lethargy of her leftists.  Revel devotes a third of the book to the radicals, alleging they wish to remain out of power.  His references to the Pompidou-Poher presidential campaign point out a stunning disinterest in practical politics and constructive action on the part of the left.  He also exposes the naivete with which French leftists view America.  He ridicules students' surprise that auto-workers are not starving and berates a radical journalist who comments.  \"'In the United States Mr. Nixon's only serious rival, for the moment, is the racist Wallace.\"'  Revel scores with each example, yet his inaccurate portrayal of America is so glaring I hesitate to accept his view of the French.  I am wary of what he may have chosen to leave out.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>ronically his attack on simplistic French attitudes precedes his own incredibly facil analysis of the United States.  <i>Without Marx or Jesus</i> hardly bothers with American society.  It is relegated to a series of confused vignettes supposedly confirming Revel's thesis.  Witness:  Leonard Bernstein's Black Panther cocktail party demonstrates a great depth of revolutionary commitment; the opposition to the \"no knock\" search law shows the growth of civil libertarianism; the movie of <i>The Strawberry Statement</i> indicates artistic fervor; the Hare Krishna Society and the Jesus freaks glow with revolution; and so do all students, all women, all liberals, and all anti-Vietnam War demonstrators.</span></p> <p><span>Revel's rose-colored glasses have thick distorting lenses through which he sees what he wishes, not what exists.  He handles his analysis of the United States by waving the stars and stripes and bellowing.  \"See, I told you it's red.\"  Everything he witnesses walks a leftist path.  His inability to acknowledge the traditional strength of American conservatism ruins his argument.  For him the country consists of the Black nation, the Woodstock nation, the Wallace nation, and the liberals.  But Woodstock was not the radical political convention that Revel calls it.  Nor have dissenters forced the United States out of Vietnam.  Nor does the fight over bussing indicate increasing racial harmony.  Nor is half the country anxious for even a gradualist liberal revolution.  Revel has declared victory even when the few skirmishes he chooses to analyze remain in doubt.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile the rest of America goes homeless.  Revel neglects the plurality that elected Nixon president.  In Revel's context Spiro Agnew is kept busy fighting a rear guard action against the massmedia.  The compulsion to split the country neatly into left and right also ignores the middle class and its love of the status quo.  American is not, as he says, \"composed of two antagonistic camps of approximately equal size.\"  The nation holds a spectrum of ideologies.  Even a division into three parts would be more valid.</span></p> <p><span><b>Y</b>et if Revel uses extremes as a propaganda device, isn't he allowed some latitude in his descriptions?  I might be tempted to accept his distortions, if only the book weren't so grindingly dull.  In his efforts to sound like a political philosopher, Revel manages to make his startling premises excruciatingly boring.  <i>Without Marx or Jesus</i> neither convincesnordelights.  Revel displays so much pompous and artificial scholarship, I even find it difficult to be outraged by his phony ideological posturing.  Absolutely rabid francophiles or phobes might be interested in this minor rhetorical gesture.  The rest of us should forget it.</span></p>"}
