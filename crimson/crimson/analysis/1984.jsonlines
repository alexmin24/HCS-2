{"title": "The West | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE WEST is solid Reagan country, the bedrock of his electoral victory four years ago.  In 1980, Reagan won more than a hundred electoral votes by carrying every state:  in the West except Hawaii.  He looks likely to repeat this trick in 1984 and win states like Arizona, Oregon, Wyoming, and the big prize, California (45 electoral votes), against almost any Democratic candidate--especially Mondale.  The only Democrat right now who could give him a lot of trouble is Cranston, but the California senator is struggling right now in the East and shows little sign of being able to last even until the primaries out west, most of which take place in May and June.</span></p> <p><span>If he can last that long, though, Cranston could conceivably resuscitate his lagging candidacy in those primaries, especially in the California primary on June 5 which offers a prize of 306 delegates to the favorite son.  Son too could Glenn, whose centrism better appeals to the heavy proportion of moderate-to-conservative voters in the sun belt states of Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada.</span></p> <p><span>But no Democrat--and that includes frontrunner Mondale--can afford to write off California entirely, and it is certain the Democrats will go after Reagan, probably by emphasizing the nuclear issues championed by Cranston.  Reagan could also be vulnerable on environmental issues there--as well as in some of the northwestern states whose populations have been rubbed the 3 wrong way by the policies of Reagan's first Secretary of the Interior, James B. Watt.  Still, given the area's basic conservatism, the West is Reagan's to lose.</span></p> <p><span>William S. Benjamin, Camille M. Ceasar, Michael F.P. Dorning, Peter R. Eccles, and Robert M.

{"title": "The Media:  the True Olympic Loser | Sports | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It doesn't pay to advertise the coming of a miracle, because more often than not, miracles don't happen on command.</span></p> <p><span>The U.S. Olympic hockey team did not produce a miracle.  But why were we all so surprised?</span></p> <p><span>Roone Arledge is losing money through his teeth these days.  The first week of the 1984 Winter Olympics was a television ratings fiasco.  This year's audiences are 50 percent smaller than four years ago, and ABC, which carries the games, has been continually swamped by competition from other networks.</span></p> <p><span>One of the reasons provided as justification for the poor ratings is the weather, blistering winds and a catastrophic snowfall, which have forced Olympic organizers to cancel or reschedule certain events, thus making coverage sporadic and uninspiring.</span></p> <p><span>But most analysts explain that the current lack of viewer interest results from heightened expectations of the U.S. hockey team.  The squad has been heavily promoted by the networks and other media, especially through product pushing advertisers.</span></p> <p><span>For the past three months, ABC has aired clip after clip of the breathtaking sequence when Mike Eruzione netted the goal that hoisted the 1980 U.S. hockey team towards the gold at the Soviet Union's expense.  Pamdemonium!  National pride!  Miracle on ice!  Blah, blah, blah...will it happen again?  became the inevitable supposition.</span></p> <p><span>The fervoe that surrounds Team U.S.A. has created a void.  America's other stars--not to mention all other international personalities and aspects of the Olympics--have been underexposed, thus prevented from fostering widespread enthusiasm about the Olympics as a whole.</span></p> <p><span>Who is Flaine Zayak from Paramus, New Jersey?  Who is America's most proficient cross-country skier?  Tell me about bobsledding or the East German threat.  What's lugging?</span></p> <p><span>The media blitz which has centered around this year's hockey team has resulted in the American public having a very narrow focus of attention.  Simultaneously, this exposure has encouraged the widespread misperception that our guys could do it again, despite the fact that they never proved to be a dominating force to begin with.  The only similarity between this year's and the 1980 squad is the letters on the jerseys.</span></p> <p><span>In all its exhibition matches, the Olympic hockey team barely broke the .500 mark, and this record grew out of wins and losses against local college squads and the Soviet \"B\" team competition.  The Olympic front line consists of three 17- or 18-year-old boys just out of high school.</span></p> <p><span>To the experts who appreciated the deficiencies of this year's hockey team, it must not have come as a total surprise that Canada upset the squad and Czechoslovakia trounced them.  They were even unable to muster a victory over Norway.</span></p> <p><span>But to the superficial, and probably unknowledgeable spectator, expectation proved inconsistent with reality.  All that was witnessed before the Olympics began was the hockey squad.  Team U.S. of A., plastered all over every magazine cover and splashed on the nation's TV screens.</span></p> <p><span>So the impression received by fair-weather spectators--a group which probably composes the bulk of any Olympic audience--grew out of a completely super-field and symbolic reference to our hockey team, at the expense of the more profound and substantive elements which determine the Olympics' true character and significance.</span></p> <p><span>With such an unstable base built to support an entire national interest, it's no wonder that when the ice hockey team came crashing down, so did America's interest in the Olympics as a whole.</span></p> <p><span>America has been betrayed by the media.</span></p> <p><span>The media's limited coverage reflected an assumption that the public couldn't appreciate anything more substantive than images that pander to the base instincts of a one-dimensional nationalism.</span></p> <p><span>Because of this strategy.  America only cared about one of many, many aspects of the Olympics:  its hockey team.  If we had concerned ourselves with more, we'd now be watching the stuff on television.</span></p> <p><span>The media, as an institution, has the ability to mold the population's value and thought processes.  In the case of the Olympics, the media's minimization of all events but hockey has had a direct impact on the public's interpretation of the Games.</span></p> <p><span>Out minds--at the risk of sounding melodramatic--were twisted, disfigured and nursed by this omnipresent institution.</span></p> <p><span>Given the power of the media--it would be quite difficult never to turn on the TV--the networks should learn from this mistake of placing so much emphasis on only one highly visible subject.  The Olympic coverage would be interpreted as a call for change.</span></p> <p><span>But that change appears unlikely, because the media, in general, is shallow shortsighted in its interpretation of events.  Instead of being the exception, the Olympic coverage America has received is the rule:  one dimensionalism pervades everywhere throughout the world of mass media.</span></p> <p><span>The current presidential campaign illustrates this phenomenon.  When the East Coast editors read about Walter Mondale's huge lead in the polls over other democratic contenders, about whom do we read?  Only Walter Mondale, despite the fact that the general election is still 10 months away.  But Mondale provokes the greatest immediate sense of interest, so the media practically disallows consideration of other candidates ideas or legitimacy.  Only if a Hart or an Askew performs well in New Hampshire, a starkly noticeable primary, will the print and broadcast media respond?</span></p> <p><span>One should pay heed to the message which the Olympics forced upon us, because it smacks us right in the face.  And like the media, it's easier for us to identify with a starting example of such a deficiency.</span></p> <p><span>Because of the Olympics, we discovered a shortcoming in the media.  Let's not forget it.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Republican Stars Shine on Ray Shamie | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Two stars from the national republican galaxy came to Boston last night hoping to brighten the cause of Republican Senate candidate Raymond Shamic.</span></p> <p><span>Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret M. Heckler told a crowd of about 400 at a $125 per plate fundraising dinner that Massachusetts had become a one partly Democratic state like the old Solid South.  \"Let's bring the balance back by sending Ray Shamie to the senate in November,\" the former Massachusetts congressman said.</span></p> <p><span>Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., the chairman of the Republican National Committee--who spoke in place of Sen. Barry F. Goldwater (R-Ariz.) because Goldwater was detained in Washington--said the party \"stands strongly behind Ray Shamie.\"</span></p> <p><span>Buoyed by polls published in The Boston Globe on Sunday, Shamie told the flag-waving crowd--after a minute-long standing ovation--that \"there's a victory coming our way in November.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I believe I represent a new emerging Massachusetts,\" said Shamie, a millionaire businessman who won 38 percent of the vote in a challenge to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54 (D-Mass.) two years ago.</span></p> <p><span>Shamie also took the chance to show that he was miffed about his treatment on a televised \"mini-debate\" with his Democratic challenger Lt. Gov. John F. Kerry last night.  In the debate on WNEV-TV, Kerry sat in the studio with the moderator while Shamie responded via a TV hookup at the Copley Place Hotel.</span></p> <p><span>\"I just had a mini-debate with John Kerry,\" Shamie said, \"though I guess it's appropriate to call any debate with John Kerry a mini-debate.  He had many words and interruptions and distortions.\"</span></p> <p><span>Because of the TV hook-up, Shamie apparently had difficulty responding to Kerry and did not get as much air time as the lieutenant governor.</span></p> <p><span>The race between Shamie and Kerry has drawn national attention because Shamie scored a tremendous primary upset over Elliot L. Richardson '41.  The race is pits two rivals from opposite ends of the political spectrum against each other--Kerry is a liberal, and Shamie is a conservative who drapes himself in the mantle of President Reagan.</span></p> <p><span>Shamie's victory was also considered significant because he won the support of large number of independents and conservative Democrats.  The Republican party in Massachusetts has not previously tapped those groups, and the possibilities for a conservative like Shamie are unclear.

Both of them used most of their short statements to cheerlead for President Reagan.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is an exciting time in the nation's history to be a Republican,\" said Fahrenkopf.</span></p> <p><span>Fahrenkopf said that as of Sunday the Republicans had registered 2.7 million new voters nationwide, far more than the 2 million the Democrats claim.

But 50 years after the inauguration of the welfare state, a growing numbers of Americans is saying, in effect.  \"Live and jet die.\"</span></p> <p><span>At the Republican National Convention this summer in Dallas, National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC) Chairman Terry Dolan announced plans one morning for a fund-raiser to be held at the ranch of multibillionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt.  Included in the press packet was a \"Statement of Principle,\" which read in part:  \"We believe that if one is indeed hungry, there is always honorable work.  We believe that aid should be forthcoming to the truly troubled, by a body most likely to know him by name.\"</span></p> <p><span>Now, NCPAC could easily be dismissed as merely one more selfish, extremist, right-wing group.  After all, it is.  But last year, this selfish, extremist, right-wing group managed to raise about $15 million from Americans all over the country.</span></p> <p><span>And NCPAC isn't marching alone.  A new breed of self-styled \"populist\" conservatives, many supported by the Moral Majority and its clones, is attacking what has always been politically unattackable since the Great Depression:  the welfare state.</span></p> <p><span>Aside from Barry Goldwater's ill-fated 1964 campaign, and President Reagan's occasional Freudian slips over the years, no mainstream politician in the post-World War II era has ever voiced serious opposition to the welfare state.  Until now, that is.  And unless we start reexamining just why we have a welfare state at all, the Dolans and Kemps and Falwells of this country--all wonderfully at ease with hairspray and television--may very well persuade a majority of our countrymen that the welfare state, like the horse and buggy, is an ides whose timed has passed.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>E'VE HEARD quite a bit this year about the \"fairness issue,\" and that might be part of the problem.  In any context, \"fair\" is an ambiguous term, subject to interoperation and debate.  In the political context, though, \"far\" has become a code word, tossed around by Democrats, reported by journalists, and generally meaning that a tax increase lurks ahead.  When Walter Mondale calls Ronald Reagan's policies \"unfair,\" then, he misses the point.  Yes, Ronald Reagan's policies are \"unfair\"--but what about the welfare state?  That's what's under attack this year.</span></p> <p><span>Opponents of the welfare state seem to fall into two categories the scrooges and the rationalizers.  The scrooges might also be called the Social Darwinists, because they believe that they have no obligation to help the less fortunate--and, in the absence of redistributive taxes, wouldn't feel any need to apologize.  Nelson Bunker Hunt is a scrooge.</span></p> <p><span>The rationalizers are more self-conscious (and socially conscious) in their reasoning.  They generally argue that, yes, I as an individual may feel an obligation to help those less fortunate than myself, but what right do I have to impose that feeling on others?  Robert Nozick is a rationalizer.</span></p> <p><span>The scrooges raise an important question:  why do we have an obligation to the less fortunate in our society?  One might argue that we should recognize that the endowment of abilities which allows some to compete well, and others not, is arbitrary.  Since any one of us could have been \"unlucky\" enough to be poorly endowed, we should help the \"losers.\"  This argument--along with any other--probably won't win over many in the Religious Right (or Rich Right), who apparently still subscribe to the medieval Chain of Being theory; your station in life is God's will, especially if you're poor.</span></p> <p><span>More important though rationalizers (or more specifically, the libertarians) would complain that the rationale does not justify the seeming coercion involved in redistribute taxes.  There is a way out, though one might call it the Reasonableness Supposition.</span></p> <p><span>No reasonable man when poor, I argue, would hope that a richer man would not help him.  Within each of us in the possibility of poverty, and the hope that poverty would be eased through the kindness of the more fortunate.  A rich man who opposes redistribution but knows he would want others to help him if he were poor wants, simply, to have his cake and eat it too.</span></p> <p><span>The role of the state, then, is to require that citizens deal ethically, i.e., in a way that is consistent with their desire to be treated compassionately if they themselves should become poor.</span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>ANY OBJECTIONS to the welfare state are procedural, rather than philosophical.  Reagan's anecdote about the \"welfare queen\" in Cleveland who was receiving 27 Social Security checks (or was it 33?) is an attack on the mismanagement or misdesign of the welfare state--not an attack on the welfare state itself.  The present welfare machinery might not be the best, and we should be willing to change it.  But the inefficiency of this welfare state should not be misconstrued as an indictment of all welfare states.</span></p> <p><span>\"Live and let live\" hails from the heart of America, while \"live and let die\" hails from the head of Hollywood, and even in an America held hostage by Hollywood happiness, there is a difference.</span></p>"}

But it also falls into the same panicky anti-Sovietism we've seen so much of over the past four years.  As soon as authors lodge legitimate criticism against the insanities of U.S. foreign policy, they feel compelled to impress their patriotism upon their readership, with usually annoying and frequently distressing results.</span></p> <p><span>Such is the case with the above editorial, in which cogent and important insights metamorphose into bungled equivocations.  The U.S. has spoken repeatedly with a forked tongue, deliberately misleading the American public with totally implausible proposals for arms cuts which fool no one abroad.  Reagan has shown he has no intention of reducing the threat of nuclear war by deploying the Pershing II and cruise missiles despite repeated Soviet and European protests.  The USSR has said for years it would walk out of Geneva if the new missiles were deployed, and they meant what they said.  For some reason, this strikes the majority as an indication of Soviet belligerence, rather that as an expression of the futility of negotiating with a power that makes preposterous \"peace\" proposals while piling up warheads in Europe.</span></p> <p><span>The Soviets, the majority say, walked out of Geneva because they don't want peace.  Even to its authors, this conclusion must seem peculiar.  The fact is, they just have to attack the USSR for <i>something.</i>  It doesn't really matter what.  That's why Sharansky and Sakharov show up in an editorial nominally about nuclear arms talks.  Not sure if the Geneva walk-out alone would constitute harsh enough evidence against the Soviets, the authors throw in the sure-fire dissident issue, to reassure their readership, and perhaps themselves, that the USSR really is the bad guy, in arms-control talks and every other issue.</span></p> <p><span>The USSR is nasty towards dissidents, true.  And the U.S., through its backing of totalitarian regimes, is responsible for the oppression of thousands of dissidents in countries like South Africa, El Salvador and Chile.  Neither of these cases, however, is remotely connected to the issue of nuclear arms negotiations.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Unwilling Talkers | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>S</b>O JUST WHAT was Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko trying to tell us when he wore grey flannel to his session with President Reagan?  Was that a sign that the Soviets were willing to accept drastic reductions in vodka stockpiles--only, of course, in return for equivalent cuts in U.S. Gold Medalists?  Had he been able to convince President Reagan to countenance competing assymetries--that is to acknowledge that the Soviet lead in vodka did not amount to first-strike capability, but was instead neatly balanced off by, at least this year, American Olympic athletes?</span></p> <p><span>Such was the level of discourse emanating from our capital last week in the wake of the overcovered and mostly inconsequential first-ever meeting between Reagan and a senior Kremlin official.  No one doubts the existence of political cynicism in years divisible by four, and certainly political cynicism was the modus operant of the day; the Reaganauts have an election to win, after all, and the Russians world opinion to placate.  Only in an Administration which pushes for high-level meeting in its fourth year, which signs no arms-control agreement, and which deep-sixes no arms-control agreements, and which deep-sixes any movement towards arms control, can the Gromyko-Reagan rumba be deemed of significance.</span></p> <p><span>But beyond satisfying the political needs of the moment, the <i>tete a tete</i> was interesting only in the degree to which it obfuscated the United State's slaggardly approach-fully shared by the Soviets-toward making do with its adversary.  Reagan mouthed all the right words in his peacenik-comelately rounting before the U.N. General Assembly, but to those who have been watching with some discrination the foreign policy deeds of his Administration, they rang hollow.  A brief capsule of this history is highly instructive.</span></p> <p><span>Ronald Reagan came into office pledging to leave the Soviet Union on the \"dustbin\" of history, and with his blessing, his minious proceeded to scuttle just about any chance for an accomodation with the evil empire.  Granted their chances were not propitious, given the beligerent Russian frame of mind and intransigence on Euromissiles, but they were non-existent under the maximalist approach to arms control favored by Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger '38 and his Svengali, Ricahrd Perle, who have had the President's ear on these matters.</span></p> <p><span>Propose \"deep cuts\" that you know the Soviets will reject out of hand--this has been the tact pursued by Administration negotiators wary of the utility of arms control and confident that the only way to meet the \"threat\" is to build more weapons.  This is the attitude that colored the U.S. zero-zero proposal on short-range missiles in Europe, and which helped scotch the reasonable \"walk-in-the-woods\" compromise under which NATO deployments would be scaled back for a reduction of Soviet SS-20s.  It is the same attitude which, in the strategic talks, asks Moscow to rein in their landbased missiles while Washington proceeds with its build-up on air and sea-launched nukes.  It is the same attitude that enables the Republicans to make the disgraceful attack on Democratic foreign policy as somehow unpatriotic.</span></p> <p><span>Now comes the unsurprising news, courtesy of a new book by <i>Time</i> diplomatic correspondent Strobe Talbott, that all along these negotiations, Reagan has failed to understand many of the basic disarmament policies of his government.  Why should Gromyko take us seriously?  Why, indeed, given the record, should we take the sudden about-face in U.S. approach, Reagan's soothing words, and the apparent pell-mell scramble for a Chernenko-Reagan summit seriously?</span></p> <p><span>It is quite clear that the Soviets have shared Washington's aversion for a constructive relationship.  If you claim you are for peace, you don't walk out out of nuclear negotiations, nor do you brutalize dissidents Andrei Sakharov or Anatoly Sharansky.  But in a U.S. election year, Russian behavior is not at issue.  Administration behavior is, and despite last week's pretty show, nothing should obscure the hard truth that Ronald Reagan has failed miserably in the task of making this world a safer place.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Hedging Their Bets | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>HEN SOVIET Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko walked away from his meeting with Walter Mondale Thursday, the usually poker-faced Soviet nyet-man was smiling.</span></p> <p><span>That smile said a number of things.  It was, first, a calculated effort to demonstrate Soviet pleasure at the upcoming resumption of talks with leaders of the United States.  It was also meant to cast Mondale as the more reasonable, moderate half of the Presidential candidate duo, as a practical statesman aware of the urgency of superpower communications.  At a brief and formal meeting with the President earlier in the week, by contrast, Gromyko was careful to maintain an expression of utter solemnity.</span></p> <p><span>\"Some ideas suggested by [Mondale], should they materialize in Washington's policy, would upen up certain possibilities for bringing the positions of the two powers closer on arms limitations and disarmament,\" Tass, the Soviet press agency, said encouragingly.</span></p> <p><span>But despite the hopeful smiles and the enthusiastic statements, the Soviets were exercising caution in voicing their preference for the 1984 election.  Too obvious an endorsement of Mondale would almost certainly have backfired, prompting many voters to desert the Democratic nominee as too conciliatory and, in U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick's words, \"soft on Communism.\"  The risk of such a backlash, significant in any election, would have been compounded in this race by Reagan's remarkable ability to maintain a monopoly on flag and patriotism--and his repeated attempts to associate Mondale with the Carter Administration's perceived inability to adequately stand up to Soviet expansionism, most notably in Afghanistan.</span></p> <p><span>The Soviet tacticians, it seems, have learned their lesson well.  According to Richard Pipes, Baird Professor of History and a former member of President Reagan's National Security Council, the Russians have been backing candidates in Western elections to differing degrees since the early 16th century.  Only in recent times, however, has their lobbying been carried to blatant extremes.  On the eve of elections in West Germany last spring, they made it abundantly clear that Moscow was rooting for the Social Democratic Party, even going so far as to warn that if the Christian Democrats triumphed in Bonn, the result could be war.  Such heavy-handed maneuvering was bound to have an adverse effect:  scores of West German voters switched their allegiance to the Christian Democrats and the SDP, the ruling party, lost.</span></p> <p><span>Suitably chastised, the Russians seem determined to exercise caution in their dealings with the volatile American electorate.  While they did agree to meet with challenger Mondale, they avoided the sort of biased pronouncements that characterized their dealings in the spring.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, there is yet another reason for the Soviet decision to publicly mince their words:  as Assistant Professor of Government Mark R. Beissinger, who teaches a course on contemporary Soviet politics, points out, \"as much as they publicly protest Reagan, the Soviets are not overjoyed either with Mondale.\"  They too remember the days of Jimmy Carter, whose vigorous human rights campaign and unusual arms control maneuvers irked them.  Mondale may be more willing to talk to the Russians than the current President, may support the cancellation of the controversial MX missile and B1 bomber and advocate a major down-scaling of defense expenditures--but he is by no means a pushover as far as the Soviets are concerned.</span></p> <p><span>It was exactly Mondale's maintenance of a hard-line stance during the last week that prevented his early meeting with Gromyko from generating any harmful backlash.  The Democratic candidate handled the sensitive situation with a deftness and caution which bespoke his past experience as a behind-the-scenes negotiator.  He kept quiet about precisely what was said in his discussion with the Soviet Foreign Minister.  He also carefully avoided jumping into actual negotiations himself, advising Gromyko in no uncertain terms to go back to the bargaining table with the Reagan Administration and upholding the President's supreme jurisdiction over national security and diplomatic matters.  Despite the heatedness of the Presidential campaign now, Mondale last week did not try to steal Reagan's limelight--and in the process, emerged as a more responsible and mature leader himself.</span></p> <p><span>It is unlikely, of course, that any major advancements in U.S.-Soviet relations will be made before the elections.  The Reagan Administration would love to negotiate a headline agreement within the next month, a feat which would undoubtedly assure the President a coronation in November.  The Soviets understandably are hedging their bets, stalling until they know exactly with whom they must deal for the next four years.  They also have some major house-cleaning to do at home:  as Pipes notes, \"their largest problem right now is not our election, but a crisis of leadership in Moscow.\"</span></p> <p><span>Yet however slim the chances for progress in negotiations between the superpowers may be in the near future, one comforting conclusion can be drawn from the historic Mondale-Gromyko meeting Thursday.  Both participants approached the table with a soberness and professionalism befitting the major problems their countries must face--a welcome change from the bluster and ideological posturing that has emanated from both the White House and the Kremlin in the last few years.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Left on Rights | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When John Shattuck settles into his Massachusetts Hall office this summer, he'll be bringing to Harvard eight years of lobbying experience and a string of accomplishments most lawmakers would envy.</span></p> <p><span>The 40-year-old Shattuck leaves his position as National Legislative Director and head of the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to fill the post of Vice President of Government and Community Affairs left vacant by Robin Schmidt's resignation last spring.  The office's responsibilities include much of Harvard's relations with Massachusetts, Cambridge, and the nation, as well as the University's lobby-efforts on such issues as financial aid and academic research.</span></p> <p><span>Shattuck's move to Harvard marks the departure from Washington of one of the capital's most visibly successful lobbyists.  Civil liberties activists credit Harvard's new vice president with transforming the ACLU into one of the most effective lobbies in the country.  \"Shattuck has succeeded in establishing the ACLU as a major force in Congress,\" says ACLU President Norman Dorsen, a professor at New York University Law School.</span></p> <p><span>\"John's about as close to anyone in Washington in being indispensable,\" adds Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference, an umbrella organization for civil rights groups.</span></p> <p><span>At a time of growing indifference and even hostility on the part of government toward civil rights issues.  Shattuck, a native of Hastings.  New York, has been a leader in the effort to block many initiatives by Senate conservatives.</span></p> <p><span>Officials in Washington cite him as having prevented attempts by Sen Jesse Helms (D.N.C) to stop the Supreme Court of jurisdiction on civil rights issues such as busing, abortion and school prayer.  The failure of the proposed Helms-Johnson Amendment, according to many observers, helped preserve the independence of the judiciary branch.</span></p> <p><span>But the thwarting of Helms's attack on the courts is hardly the only feather in Shattuck's hat In 1974, four years out of Yale Law School and working as a litigator for the ACLU.  Shattuck represented Morton H. Halperin in his suit against the government at the height of the Watergate scandal.  Halperin, an assistant to Henry A. Kissinger '50 when the latter was National Security advisor, was a victim of wiretapping illegally authorized by then-President Richard M. Nixon and Kissinger in the early days of Nixon's presidency.  During the case, Shattuck obtained depositions from Nixon, Kissinger, H.R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and Attorney General John Mitchell.  Included in these was an eight-hour session with Nixon at his San Clemente estate.  After two years of hearings, the court ruled in favor of Halperin, but because of rules stipulating immunity of federal officials, no damages were awarded.  Much of the evidence from the case was also used by the House Judiciary Committee in its impeachment proceedings against Nixon.</span></p> <p><span>Shattuck's name emerged from a list of candidates for the post compiled over the summer by President Bok.  Along with other members of a selection committee, Bok sent out letters to nationwide contacts asking for someone to fill Schmidt's post.  \"Because he moved widely in government and congressional circles (Shattuck's) name was mentioned often and he was the kind of candidate we wanted,\" Daniel Steiner '54, University vice president and general counsel, says.</span></p> <p><span>Formidable challenges will continue to awai:  Shattuck in his new role.  In recent years, Harvard has found itself part of a growing opposition to many government policies on higher education, while cutbacks in federally funded financial aid for students and research threaten universities livelihood and autonomy.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is an educational crisis in America today,\" Shattuck says, adding, \"Issues of education and public policy facing Harvard and universities will be just as, if not more challenging than much of my ACLU work.\"</span></p> <p><span>In addition to his vice presidency, Shattuck will teach a Harvard Law School course on civil liberties starting in the spring of 1985.</span></p> <p><span>Heading the list of problems Shattuck expects to deal with is the increasing inaccessibility of government information for academic research.  He cites the growing use of defense classification for information the government does not want publicized, and tightened restrictions on exchanges with foreign scholars as circumstances endangering academic freedom.</span></p> <p><span>But battling government secrecy is no novelty for the Washington veteran.  Shattuck and the ACLU have consistently opposed the Reagan Administration's effort to force 130,000 federal employees to sign secrecy agreements requiring them to obtain government clearance before speaking publicly or writing about issues within their work.  Prior to that, the 1966 Yale graduate played an influential role in persuading Congress not to roll back the Freedom of Information Act, a key legislative safeguard for academic freedom.</span></p> <p><span>Along with the secrecy issue.  Shattuck, who also has an M.A. from Cambridge, sees financial and as another major area confronting his office.  He sees recent cuts in student loan programs as only one of many examples of students' increased difficulty in obtaining federal funds.</span></p> <p><span>\"Higher education is a higher national security interest than defense,\" says Shattuck, who was an anti-war activist as an undergraduate.  \"My office must raise these issues of priority and work to restore the funding cuts.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Certainly the issue of who will have access to higher education and the effect of cuts on people with less money and minorities, will be one of the major issues he'll be facing,\" says Steiner, University vice president and general counsel.</span></p> <p><span>Both Shattuck and Steiner point to affirmative action as another troublespot likely to consume much of the new vice president's efforts.  Under Shattuck's direction, the Office of Government and Community Affairs will push for legislation to allocate more funds for minorities and women in Ph.D. programs, with hopes of increasing the representation of these groups on the University faculty.</span></p> <p><span>\"John has an excellent record on affirmative action in his own office and that will be helpful to us,\" Steiner remarks.</span></p> <p><span>Colleagues and government officials who have collaborated with Shattuck on various commissions and issues praise his leadership skills and enormous capacity for work.</span></p> <p><span>\"John can put together coalitions with a lot of different voices in them,\" says Burton Whides '62, counsel to Senator Edward M. Kennedy '54 (D-Mass.).  \"He's respected by a broad spectrum of senators.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"He's a consensus builder.  He knows how to get people to work together from disparate constituencies,\" adds Neas of the Leadership Conference.</span></p> <p><span>And though he has spent more than 13 years in the nation's capital, Shattuck still has plenty of grassroots experience, some dating back to the days of Vietnam and the popularly supported Presidential candidacy of former Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy More recently.  Shattuck was the architect of a national bill of rights lobby designed to counter the efforts of the Moral Majority.  The organization boasts 15,000 members inchapters all over the country.</span></p> <p><span>Aside from targeting certain areas in which to concentrate his efforts, Shattuck is reluctant to map out a specific agenda of actions he plans to take.  Until he moves into the job full-time beginning July 1, he will be commuting once or twice a week to Cambridge from Washington, where his wife and three children live.</span></p> <p><span>Shattuck stresses the need for Harvard to improve its relations with the outside world at all levels:  the local, the state and the national.  He places particular emphasis on improving relations with Cambridge.  He cites as an example the university's current efforts to retrain local teachers in science and math and to provide access to computers for Cambridge schools.  \"My proposal is to start with the local area and work out from there,\" he says adding.  \"This is an area where Harvard can be a leader.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Rotten Choices | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>N</b>EARLY one-and-one half million American Indians live scattered across the country, about half in urban poverty and the other half on desolate reservations in the scrawniest parts of several Western states.  Basically forgotten by the general public, the Indians have suffered the ravages of hard times economically and deep federal budget cuts in aid, which together threaten what hope they might have left for self-sufficiency and a decent kind of life.</span></p> <p><span>Funds for Indian programs will likely be no more than $2.3 billion for the coming year, $353 million less than 1983 and $500 million less than 1982.  Even the ugly alternatives for economic gains--large scale mining and exploitation of gas and oil reserves held on tribal lands--are becoming less and less reliable as world energy prices drop.</span></p> <p><span>Against this background a letter came East last month from Porcupine, South Dakota--from a bitter Lakota Indian.  Russell Means.  Means is running for president of his tribal council with a slate of candidates representing a program known as TREATY--an acronym for the True Revolution for Elders.  Ancestors, Treaties and Youth His platform is utterly revolutionary--complete and immediate severance of relations with the United States.</span></p> <p><span>\"It we get elected we will become an independent nation,\" Means said in an interview this week.  \"We wouldn't be breaking away from anything.  We would be reaffirming our freedom under United States law and international law.\"</span></p> <p><span>As backing for his rather extreme view, Means cites Article Six of the Constitution, which dictates that the U.S. can only enter treaties with sovereign nations, and he cites the fact that the government has signed four treaties with the Lakota nation.  Means says that his tribe \"is a sovereign nation, and it is time we started acting sovereign.\"</span></p> <p><span>The frustration implicit in Means' words is not unique.  Indians around the country are rightly angry over years of shabby treatment at the hands of the government.  They are rightly dismayed over their powerlessness, and the double-edged sword of development.  Companies like Union Carbide, working with the Reagan Administration's blessing, are moving to get rights to strip-mine the Lakota land, one of the poorest in the country, a bare plot of 4500 square miles in southwest South Dakota.  Their goal is the fantastically lucrative uranium bed that sits under the land and that could, if properly cultivated, prove a panacea to the tribe's poverty.  It could mean, among other things, hundreds of thousands of dollars for education and jobs.  It could also scatter acres of carcinogenic dust and toxic uranium across the tribe's reservation.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT THE hazards of development only hint at the complexity of the questions facing Indians like Russell Means.  In the Reagan Administration's drive for a new \"federalism,\" the Indians appear to be regaining a tremendous-many say overwhelming--amount of jurisdiction over their economic and governmental affairs.  But it is not clear that this independence, which would appear to be precisely what many Indians want, will do much to get at their fundamental problems of alcoholism, poverty, and isolation.</span></p> <p><span>On the face of it, the rhetoric and general aims of Reagan officials appear laudable.  \"Indian tribes must become more self-sufficient and less dependent on the federal government,\" says assistant secretary of the Interior Kenneth L. Wasco, who is a Wasco Indian from Oregon himself.  \"Sometimes when, you're pressed, that's when you make your best decision.\"  While that new power has meant hard choices, for some tribes Reagan's four years have been successful.</span></p> <p><span>*The White House has worked to pass legislation to establish \"free-enterprise zones\" on reservations, permit tribes to issue their own tax-free bonds to raise capital for development projects and give the tribes greater flexibility in deciding how they will manage their own mineral deposits.</span></p> <p><span>*The Jicarilla Apaches in New Mexico now have 100 percent ownership of oil and gas wells on their land and won a 1982 Supreme Court ruling which allowed them to impose so-called \"severance taxes\" on oil, gas and minerals extracted from their lands.</span></p> <p><span>*Navaho Indians in Arizona and New Mexico successfully negotiated with Atlantic Richfield to turn an initial $300,000 ARCO offer for right-of-way to build a pipeline across their land into a contract that will bring the tribe $78 million over the next 20 years.</span></p> <p><span>*Indians across the West are asking for--and getting--hiring quotas at mining and drilling sites, special training programs, and education funds from the corporations they sell their resources to.  In coal-rich Wyoming, tribes are renegotiating leases to get a larger share of the selling price for coal.</span></p> <p><span>On top of all this the Bureau of Indian Affairs has been steadily contracting out to the tribes more and more of its police, job-training, education and social programs every year.  In 1983, BIA handed over control of $235 million of these projects to the tribes, up from $50 million in 1976.  Congress last year appropriated $5 million in \"seed money\" to attract light industry and business to the reservations.</span></p> <p><span>The surface of things, then, seems rosy.  The tribes own, altogether, 52 million acres of land with 5 percent of the nation's oil and gas reserves, 470 billion tons of high-quality coal and half of the nation's uranium supply, valued at $400 billion.  The southwestern Navahos, with 160,000 members, are making $55 million a year from mining and pumping petroleum.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT THE numbers aren't adding up everywhere.  Oil and gas production brought the Indians $169 million nationwide in 1980, but with 400,000 Indians living on energy-resources land, that amounted to only $422 per person, a drop in the bucket.  Almost 37 percent of all Indians families earned less than $10,000 in 1980, and half of those earned less than $5000.  Less than 20 percent are earning more than $20,000 yearly, compared to about 40 percent for the rest of America.</span></p> <p><span>More ominous, in non-economic terms, the plight of the Indians is shocking.  Twenty-five of every 100,000 Indians will be murdered in a given year, two-and-a-half times the national average, and 22 will kill themselves--twice the national average.  Diseases like diabetes, pneumonia, influenza and tuberculosis are generally three times as likely to take Indians' lives as others.</span></p> <p><span>Even more destructive is the alcoholism that plagues both Indians on reservations and those who move to cities like Los Angeles (which with 50,000 Indians has the largest population of any city in the country), Denver, Chicago, New York and Boston Indians are eight times as likely as the general population to die of alcoholism related causes, from diseases like cirrhosis or in drunk-driving automobile accidents.  The alcoholism, leaders say, stems from a sense of powerlessness and frustration.</span></p> <p><span>The energy bonanza, morever, won't last forever either.  For instance, income from mineral production dropped $7 million in 1983 to $26 million for the 4800 Arapahoe and Shoshone Indians in Wyoming.</span></p> <p><span>But what irritates, Indians most of all is the hypocrisy involved in the government's ostensible push for more localized authority.  While preaching the \"new federalism.\"  Reagan officials are axeing areas of the budget needed to make that mean something.  Federal cuts in the comprehensive Employment and Training Act damage hopes for development by, for example, forcing the closing of a vocational-technical center at the Wyoming Indian High School which serves the Arapahoe and Shoshone Indians.  As Robert Rowan, the principal of the school, remarks:  \"They want to see Indians control their own destiny, but they're cutting the areas that would provide the Indians with the direction to do so.\"</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, for many tribes Reagan'a cheerful plans for business development are simply unworkable, given reservations' desolation and isolation.  The Navahos of Arizona live on top of $2.5 billion worth of coal, but can't get to it without a $100 million railroad.  And this is not to mention the potential envrionmental problems posed by such an endeavor.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HIS CATCH-22 situation has to be in Russell Means's mind as he tries to get elected president of the Oglala Sioux tribal council.  While he watches the young move out to the cities and the old die off or die in the bottle, he knows that answers to all his problems could be right at his feet in the form of uranium and other valuable minerals.</span></p> <p><span>But Russell Menas also knows the classic land-rape as practiced-by the American corporation, and knows the ongoing 100-year epic of brutal wars and ignored promises.  He also knows that the miners will use huge amounts of water--possibly the whole of Pine Ridge's aquifer--in the process of extracting the uranium and zeolite, and he knows what strip-mined land looks like, what the acres and acres of barren, torn up, lifeless land could look like.  His is the classic Indian dilemma--between development or poverty, neither palatable options--and Reagan has done nothing to get at this.</span></p> <p><span>What is so tragic about Means's campaign is that be sees no hope in anything but separation.  The few services still offered by the government will be jeopardized when a tidal wave of $180 billion in red ink rolls into Congress is spring.  And the current Administration seems to have no concern for protecting the landscape from developers.  The end result of such a tragedy can only be polarization, annihilation, and despair.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Yuri Is Dead; Long Live... | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>Y</b>URI ANDROPOV IS DEAD and the Reagan Administration seems to think it has won a gunfight.  The tact-less, admonitory lone of the Reagan letter of condolence and the Secretary of State's call for \"new contacts\" have the air of a gunfighter dictating terms; one would imagine the president holding his pistol to the hotline while saying, \"Now get up slow...\"</span></p> <p><span>The United States message of condolence preceded Vice President Bush's delegation to the funeral to arrive in Moscow Tuesday.  The statement contained, strangely enough, the Administration's throw-away paragraph usually reserved to excuse bad relations with the Russians:  \"...the United States has sought and will continue to seek a constructive and realistic dialogue and the reduction of arms.\"  This is a truly odd sentence in a letter of condolence for a leader with whom one has not been able to negotiate at all, unless of course it was meant ironically.  It's good to know we will continue to seek a dialogue with the Russians in which the Russians don't talk; but then we have one of those already.</span></p> <p><span>Secretary of State George Schultz added his own share of tactlessness in his grotesque call for the Russians to make \"new contacts\" with the U.S., as if Andropov had somehow been the cause of Russian diffidence.  \"We seek to find solutions to real problems,\" said Mr. Schultz rather cryptically, adding \"this applies in particular to the task of reaching equitable and verifiable agreements for arms reductions and reducing the risk of war.\"  A White House set of separate comments added that the U.S. hoped the Soviet Union would \"take advantage of the opportunities at hand\" to improve relations.  But what the administration seems to forget is that Andropov was no more the cause of that breakdown than our own gun-toting President:  after all, it was Reagan that diplomatically labelled the Soviet Union as \"evil empire.\"  The Administration's apparent view that the Russians will suddenly \"come around\" now that Andropov has died seems dangerously and ludicrously wishful.</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, this is a time of transition in the Kremlin and a time when American policy and overtures can make a difference.  American <i>policy</i> that is, not blustering.  As former Ambassador to the U.S.S.R. Averell W. Harriman noted last week, this is \"a time for caution;\" the Soviet leaders will be jockeying amongst each other for position and in the next week or so, the Kremlin will have a new leader.  The choices range from younger, more worldly candidates like Mikhail Gorbaschev to the more conservative Konstantin Chernenko and Grigory V. Romanov, but speculation also includes the hawkish Defense Minister Dmitri F. Ustinov, who seems singlehandedly to have masterminded much of Russia's military buildup Further, Ustinov is one of the major power-brokers in the Politburo and is likely to influence heavily the choice of Andropov's successor.  Although it would be wrong to overstate the United States' influence on the selection, it seems foolish for the administration to push the Soviets into the arms of two particularly conservative candidates with its hawkish remarks.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HATEVER the case, it seems foolish of the Reagan Administration not to seize this juncture as a crucial moment to build from the ashes of the Reagan-Andropov stand-off.  President Reagan ought not to be sending ersatz messages of condolence in the back pocket of his Vice-President; he should be attending the funeral himself.  If Reagan were to attend the funeral it would signal the end of one of the most foolish and dangerous trends in U.S. Soviet relations.  Not since Kruschev came to America in the 1960s has a Russian or an American bead of state visited the other country during their tenure.  Reagan, indeed, seems to have a grand imaginative disdain for Russia, as if it were really not a country worth visiting, but a land where savage Darth Vaders punish and abuse helpless Ivan and Vanyas.  Unfortunately for Mr. Reagan's Jim and Sally, however, Jvan and Vanya are part of a very powerful country which seeks to negotiate with the same self-confidence and self-respect that Jim and Sally feel it will not do for the United States President to continue admonishing the Soviets, and it is supremely tactless for him to do so at a funeral.  Instead, the Reagan administration itself should take this opportunity to try to improve relations:  a trip to Andropov's bier would be the first step toward forming the basis of mutual respect which has been entirely missing from our cold-warrior relations.</span></p> <p><span>But instead, the President seems bent on allowing this act of fate to drag relations with the Soviets not forward, but back to the starting gate.  And fate promises to relieve the Administration of the necessity of proving conciliatory in the election year to come, to muffle the bad press resulting from having presided over the worst level of Soviet-American relations in recent history Circumstance has offered the Administration a convenient way out which they seem inclined to follow, even at the risk of losing a rare chance to open a better route.</span></p>"}

To see this as sufficient cause for a graveside jig, however, is to prove oneself blind to the glaring irony of this new diplomatic development.  Reagan sent Bush because he would not stoop to any act, regardless of its diplomatic or humane merits, that might further detente's evil cause.  But Bush is far more than a mere executive flunkie.  We should all remember, now more than ever, that George Bush ran the Central Intelligence Agency.</span></p> <p><span>The KGB and Andropov were tools of vicious repression, again true.  Our government is quick to supply us with examples of Soviet ruthlessness and brutality.  All the more reason, therefore, we should turn a fearful countenance to our own \"Big Brother.\"  Unfortunately, documented examples of CIA spying and murder are more often fed to the paper-shredder than to the media.  The car-bombing of Cuban diplomat Orlando Letelier, however, is certainly attributable to the CIA during Bush's tenure.  There are other examples, equally frightening, which space will not allow.</span></p> <p><span>Bush conveying U.S. condolences over Andropov's death is thus more significant than a flubbed diplomatic opportunity.

Andropov was announced last week, leaving his successes a myriad of domestic and foreign policy problems, not the least of which is the current chill in superpower relations.  While it is hard to mourn a man for all intents and purposes dead for several months--who became a frightening parody of the fabled Big Brother of George Orwell's <i>1984.</i>  Andropov's death serves as a depressing reminder of how little progress the U.S. and the Soviet Union have made in this decade.</span></p> <p><span>The prospects do not look good for any sort of improvement in the near future, especially since any of Andropov's possible successors are firmly indoctrinated with party politics, or what now passes for Marxist-Leninist ideology Konstantin U. Chernenko, the odds-on favorite, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Grigory V. Romanov, or any of the other party bigwigs who may fill Andropov's spot will probably serve as the front-man for the ruling Politburo at least for several years.  As with the past five Soviet rulers, power consolidation will undoubtedly come slowly.</span></p> <p><span>That is why President Reagan should use Andropov's death as a chance to improve the abysmal lack of dialogue between the adversaries.  The uncertain power structure in the Kremlin makes it unlikely that the Soviets will differ substantially from their previous negotiating positions in the suspended INF and START talks in Europe.  President Reagan, with his usual obstinate confidence, has assured the American public that the no-longer \"evil empire\" will return to the negotiating table on its knees and with roses in its teeth.  But the truth is that the U.S. must make the first move by softening its stance on Euromissile deployment, an area where we are most politically vulnerable.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan already flubbed the opportunity to lessen the dangerous cold war mentality that has descended on the superpowers by sending his vice president.  George Bush, to Moscow in his place.  Reagan's snub, coming on the heels of a similar turn-down upon Leonid Brezhnev's death, only underscores his lack of understanding about the finer points of superpower relations.</span></p> <p><span>\"While our governments have very different views,\" Reagan said in his weekly radio broadcast Saturday.  \"our sons and daughters have never fought each other.

The question is whether polls affect the outcome of presidential elections, and the experts are divided.</span></p> <p><span>Those who say that polls influence the electorate rather than simply mirror its attitudes cite three main trends; the bandwagon effect, the underdog effect and the media effect.</span></p> <p><span>Those who say political polling generates a bandwagon effect claim the surveys cause voters and financial backers to follow the crowd and abandon unpopular candidates.</span></p> <p><span>\"Polls affect things rather dramatically,\" says Dan Callegari, Sen. Gary W. Hart's (D-Col.) Manchester, N.H. campaign coordinator.  \"If you're not showing strength in the polls, then you have to sell your candidate twice as hard.  Mondale's campaign theme is that he is doing best in the polls.\"</span></p> <p><span>Evidence suggests a correlation between success in the polls and success in fundraising.  Those with money to donate are less likely to invest in the unpromising future of a candidate struggling in the polls.  Contributions translate into political favors only if the candidate gains office.</span></p> <p><span>\"The strongest effect of these polls is to financial contributions,\" says Adam J. Clymer '58, assistant to the executive editor in charge of polling at <i>The New York Times.</i>  \"The people who give money are not the average voters, and they want to be winners.\"</span></p> <p><span>During the 1976 presidential campaign, Jimmy Carter did not receive ample contributions to promote a viable campaign until he made a huge jump in the national polls, Clymer adds.</span></p> <p><span>It is more difficult to show the effect of poll standings on a candidate's success on election day.  One branch of the bandwagon theory predicts that supporters of those performing poorly in the polls often fail to vote because they believe their cause is lost.</span></p> <p><span>Another major theory predicts a diametrically opposite effect.  According to the underdog theory, a large portion of the electorate, believing that victory is assured, simply don't bother to vote.  Supporters of this theory also contend that because people naturally sympathize with the underdog, voters may cast their ballots out of pity for, rather than in support of, a candidate.</span></p> <p><span>Many people subscribe to neither theory.  \"I don't think that people vote for the loser because of polls,\" says Michael Barone '68, formerly vice-president of a private polling agency and now a <i>Washington Post</i> editorial writer.  But \"the ordinary voter does not get a huge charge from being on the winning team,\" Barone adds.</span></p> <p><span>To the extent that there is a bandwagon effect, Barone says, it is unfair to blame it on polls.  \"People don't live in a vacuum where polls are their only access to reality,\" he contends.  \"The poll is only one of many items that gives people information to who is ahead.  The media, word of mouth, neighbors, advertising, leaflets, door-to-door campaigning--all relay certain impressions to the voter,\" he adds.</span></p> <p><span>Experts agree that both underdog and bandwagon effects tend to be stronger in primaries than in general elections.  \"Most of the evidence suggests that the polls in general elections have a very limited bandwagon or underdog effect,\" says Gary R. Orren, a Kennedy School professor.  In a general election, partisanship provides a broad base of support that \"outweighs\" any potential effect the polls might have, Orren adds.</span></p> <p><span>This partisanship does not exist in primaries, and the differences among candidates may not be as well defined and tangible as they are in general elections.  \"In these primaries,\" Orren says, \"people tend to vote strategically.\"</span></p> <p><span>In a primary there is a tendency not to \"waste votes,\" Clymer says.  Some may gain comfort in casting \"symbolic votes\"--ones for candidates whose ideas the voter agrees with but who have no chance of winning.  \"But others could say, 'I should vote for the guy I like second best because my guy has no shot, and I don't want my least favorite candidate to win,'\" Clymer says.</span></p> <p><span>Some analysis maintain that even in primaries, the amount of strategic voting is relatively small.  \"The public polls which appear throughout the media are, by and large, a product of the spectator sport element of politics,\" says Geoffrey D. Garin '75, president of Peter D. Hart Research Associates, a private polling company, whose clients include Democratic frontrunner Walter F. Mondale.</span></p> <p><span>\"These polls do not have a very direct impact.  For instance, you may end up rooting for the Yankees because they're in first place.  But most people do not give their loyalties to a team--or a candidate--based on its standings.  Even when there are many candidates,\" Garin adds.</span></p> <p><span>Whether or not voters are directly effected by polls, polls may govern the amount of media attention each candidate receives.  Many people believe that, if nothing else, there is a strong media bandwagon effect.</span></p> <p><span>\"The only thing the press covers is polls,\" Callegari asserts.  \"If you're not a frontrunner then the polls don't mean anything.  When they show some upward movement that's when things start ticking and you receive some cover age.  The media is not that ambitious to cover...those who aren't high in the polls,\" he adds.</span></p> <p><span>Members of the media and many other observers claim that polls don't have the virtually limitless influence Callegari suggests.  Barone points out that <i>The Washington Post</i> has run editorials and articles about Reubin O. Askew, who has fared poorly in the polls.</span></p> <p><span>\"Askew's gotten coverage from us,\" Barone says.  \"If he doesn't do well, it's not really the fault of <i>The Post.</i>  He's had his chance to make his case to the public.\"</span></p> <p><span>Garin says that though Jesse L. Jackson has tallied less than five percent in national preference polls, he has received abundant media coverage.</span></p> <p><span>\"True, you can get extensive coverage because of the polls,\" Barone says, \"but also by being interesting.  Jackson's not popular, but he's covered.  The polls are only a small part of what makes media coverage.\"</span></p> <p><span>The many democratic forums, debates and road shows have resulted in a moderate amount of exposure for each candidate, Orren says.  \"I think that the media coverage has been rather evenhanded,\" he adds.  \"There's no evidence that Mondale is getting excessive coverage.  The voters know who the candidates are.\"</span></p> <p><span>Whether or not polls affect the outcome of elections, candidates faring poorly in polls have traditionally sought to discredit them.  During the 1968 presidential campaign, when most polls showed Hubert H. Humphrey trailing Richard M. Nixon by a wide margin, Humphrey once called a press conference to change that the Gallup Poll the views of Blacks.  More recently, Boston mayoral candidate Melvin H.

Stone, he spends his time in his study talking into a tape-recorder, defending his career before an imaginary judge.  He claims that the multi-millionaires of California's Bohemian Grove--the real rulers of America's industry and military--put him in the presidency.  He didn't really want to continue war in Vietnam or get involved in the Chilean counter-revolution, but rather those filthy moneymongers forced him to.  Finally, sick of prostituting himself and his country, he resolved to stop being their puppet.  As a result, they organized the Watergate scandal to boot him out of office.  Nixon reveals all sorts of other things too--his dreams of being Abraham Lincoln, his childhood insecurities, his hatred of Kennedy.  And when he's really raving, he spouts obscenities at the portrait of Kissinger on the wall, sings ditties at the piano, and cries to his dead mother for forgiveness.</span></p> <p><span>All this information about this former president ought to be intriguing and provocative.  But <i>Secret Honor:  Nixon's Last Tape</i> is baffling and boring; a self-indulgent, sophomoric parody of a political figure who was actually very complex.  The play's concept is amusing, but its unstructured, hour-and-40-minute monologue without intermission is sleep-inducing.  Besides, Nixon (Philip Baker Hall) drops names and scandals in such an incoherent jumble that only someone minutely familiar with his career can grasp what is going on.  Mixing facts and falsehood, he'll jump from the topic of Watergate to his first grammar school debate (he argued that girls were no good and won).  What's more, he constantly interrupts his stream of jibberish, by raising his arms and launching into political rhetoric, by strewing papers around the room and slipping on them, or by going into prayer.</span></p> <p><span>In their \"political myth, \"Freed and Stone create a flat and unoriginal character.

At the end of the play, he reaches for the apron strings of his Quaker mother, whining \"Mama, tell me what to do.\"  He's the typical wimp who has cracked under pressure and now suffers under the delusion that he was really a hero who preserved his \"secret honor.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>T ONE POINT Nixon complains to the judge:  \"You know the cartoons with the stubble and the jowls--do you realize that I have feelings too?\"  And in many ways the writers of the play themselves are cartoonists who place Nixon in the most humiliating light possible and mock him; theirs is the mentality of postcards that show a bald Reagan in nothing but his sweatsocks.  At the beginning of the play, Nixon spends 10 inept minutes hemming and hawing the words \"Testing:  one, two, three...uh...uh...four,\" while fumbling with a tape that keeps blasting out the Goldberg variations.  Nostalgically, he reminisces about all the dopey things he loved to do as President.  These memories include sitting at his desk \"with the fireplace running and the air-conditioning on\" and inviting over Redskins stars on the white phone while discussing bombing Cuba with Kissinger on the red phone.  Insanely, he tells his microphone how after Watergate the press and the liberals ate him alive--\" an army of Ralph Naders and Jane Fondas and Jews and Redskin rats.\"  Holding a gun to its metallic head, he screams at it:  \"And they'll come after you too!\"</span></p> <p><span>Although this tiresome monologue isn't much of a play, Philip Baker Hall does his best with the material and puts in a good performance as Nixon.  With his deep, grumbly voice, he sounds like Nixon; with his long, flabby nose, brushed-back strands of greasy hair, baggy eyes and big ears, he looks like Nixon.  Despite a tendency to slur his words, Hall delivers his lines as if he is truly absorbed by his train of thought, as if he has convinced himself that what he is saying is actually the truth.  Unaware of his character's absurdity, Hall's Nixon compulsively unburdens himself of his guilty pleas and wild excuses.</span></p> <p><span>But the audience gets no real sense of the man or the era.  Nixon's confession is so warped and garbled that it is easier to dismiss his ideas than to digest them or speculate on their political or psychological significance.

But in the space of four years, since the last Presidential election year, education has jumped from sitting on the backburner to being one of the most debated topics on the campaign trail.</span></p> <p><span>Part of the reason for this is the flurry of commission reports that have emerged in the last year bemoaning the decline of the U.S. education system and calling for the reinstitution of tougher curriculum standards at all levels.  These ranged from a report commissioned by Reagan himself to ones carried out by several private foundations.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, at least in the higher education sphere, the Reagan efforts to slice into student financial aid from the government has spawned an unusually vehement reaction from some constituents groups, especially students themselves.</span></p> <p><span>The result is that presidential candidates of all stripes are waving the educational banner in the current campaign--vigorously debating such issues as \"merit pay\" for teachers, throwing out plans for funneling more money into educational programs, and generally trying to out-promise each other over what they plan to do to get the nation's schools back on track.</span></p> <p><span>Considering just a few of the candidates who have been most outspoken on the matter gives an idea of the extensive role to which the education issue ha come to play in the campaign:</span></p> <p><span>* Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale has proposed a more vigorous federal approach to the issue.  He wants to establish a federally sponsored \"Fund for Excellence..\" which would pump money to community education groups;</span></p> <p><span>* Colorado Sen. Gary W. Hart has devoted a good deal of time to highlighting his relatively young age (46) and his understanding of the concerns of the post-War generation.  The centerpiece of his education platform is his so-called American Defense Education Act. a program be proposed last year to beet up teaching in much, science, and computer use.</span></p> <p><span>* South Carolina Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, in his capacity as a ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, has moved to increase funding for the 1984 education budget by $1 billion, upping the eventual outlay to $16.1.  Hollings has in particular, gone after Reagan's hike in defense spending as a prime reason for the decline in education, saying in a recent speech.  \"I think the school children of America are worth at least one weapons system.\"</span></p> <p><span>* President Reagan has taken a different tack in his stand on educational issues, stressing the important role states have to play in combatting drug use and violence in schools and reinstating \"traditional roles.\"  In his televised announcement two weeks ago that he was seeking reelection, Reagan said that schools must \"find room for God,\" a reference to his efforts to bring voluntary prayer back to the classroom.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>hile it is these candidates who have generally taken the lead on the education issues, the rest of the eight Democratic candidates have also worked many of the same themes into their campaign rhetoric.  Still, expects are unsure as to the role any of these issues might play in the unfolding campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Education issues really fall into two camps--the primary and secondary school questions and the collegiate questions--both of which are markedly different Debate on the kindergarten to high school years has focused on a range of topics--from teacher training and core curriculi to computer literacy, math and science competency, and tuition tax credits for parents of private school children.</span></p> <p><span>On the other hand, the issue in higher education, say experts, is mostly money--money for students and money for research.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is no way you can claim there is equal opportunity when you cut aid,\" says Charles B. Saunders, a lobbyist for the American Council on Education, which has played an active role in fighting Reagan's budget cuts in federal student age.  Says Saunders, explaining the widely stated rationale for student and programs.  \"By definition you're limiting the kind of access to higher education.\"</span></p> <p><span>Saunders and other educators can be expected to press their cast against the Reagan program for higher education, especially in light of even more drastic proposed cutbacks in the area for the budget for fiscal year 1985.  But while it is unclear just how important education in general will ultimately be in the campaign, issues involving elementary and secondary schools will most likely overshadow the higher education issues.</span></p> <p><span>\"I would like to see lot of focus on elementary and secondary education,\" says Notre Dame University President Father Theodore M. Hesburgh, a prominent American educator.  \"You can have all the Harvards in the world, and it won't matter without primary and secondary education.\"</span></p> <p><span>One of the major points stressed in this area, at least by presidential candidates, is getting back to concentrated core curriculi in elementary and high schools--curriculi that emphasize traditional subjects.  This especially includes topics in math and science, where U.S. slippage has made many educators fearful for future trends in industrial productivity.</span></p> <p><span>\"All of what have been called self-realization courses, all of the driver ed and music and band and a lot of other things...let's not let them interfere with what is a core curriculum, what is core to a good education,\" says candidate Glenn.  \"Getting back to a good core curriculum--that doesn't cost any money.\"</span></p> <p><span>One other move that is gaining widespread bipartisan support is the idea of \"merit pay,\" or encouraging good teachers by dangling before them possible salary increases.  Reagan and several of the Democratic eight have supported the proposal in general, though no one has proposed anything specific.</span></p> <p><span>The race to get on the right side of the educational fence has also been accelerated by pressure from teacher lobbying groups, especially the National Educational Association (NEA), which endorsed Mondale last fall.  The NEA endorsement is more than a more stamp of approval for Mondale's platform:  it carries with it the promise of campaign workers nationwide and a organization that rivals the AFL-CIO, another group that has backed the Minnesotan.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the general focus on lower-level education, a healthy bureaucratic battle has been waged over questions of higher education.  Yet a number of educators bemoan the fact that higher education is not, in the words of University of Minnesota President C. Peter Magrath, \"a politically attractive issue.\"</span></p> <p><span>Magrath says the electorate is short-sighted in focusing exclusively on elementary and secondary schools to the detriment of higher education issues, which in the end have a great long-term significance.</span></p> <p><span>\"The colleges don't get the structural attention they deserve,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>What little debate there has been in the public arena has largely focused on budget issues, but educators acknowledge it is tough to get the public worked up over cuts in financial aid given the swollen budget deficits nearing $200 billion.</span></p> <p><span>Education lobbyists have cried foul over Reagan's proposal, and many charge him with disregarding higher education.  The proposed budget would include a cut of $326 million in funding for need-based programs, which, according to education groups, would cut off nearly 800,000 of the 12 million college and graduate students who receive aid.</span></p> <p><span>The budget also seeks to eliminate federal funding for several educational programs, including National Direct Student Loans (NDSL).  Supplement Grants, State Student Incentive Grants.  Graduate Student Fellowships, and a program to help build and renovate academic facilities.</span></p> <p><span>Offsetting these cuts, however, is a major hike in funding for work study programs from $550 million to $850 million.  The level of Pell Grant funding would remain equal.  (See accompanying story).</span></p> <p><span>The issues raised in the budget are familiar to lobbyists and other educators who over the last three years have fought the Reagan cutbacks tooth and nail.  These seasoned pros generally make two points about the education budget as it relates to politics--one, many of Reagan's proposed cutbacks are certain to be restored by Congress and, two, it should not play more than a small role in the election campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\"The President's proposals are going to be thrown out so fast they will be soon forgotten,\" says Saunders.</span></p> <p><span>More ominous, says Minnesota's Magrath, the next nine months are not likely to yield any substantive proposals for higher education--beyond the specific rebutting on the Reagan budge.</span></p> <p><span>The Democrats \"can certainly demonstrate there has been a drop in federal concern for research and development,\" he says.  \"But I'm not sure the political campaign of 1984 will bring any focused discussion on the issue.\"  Magrath himself favors fellow Minnesotan Mondale because he shows a \"specific commitment\" to financial support for lower and middle-class students.</span></p> <p><span>It is not clear, then, whether any of the over the education budget should have much of an active effect on students.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard federal lobbyist Parker L. Coddington says of the various Democratic proposals to restore funding for aid programs.  \"They're all very general ideas.  Price tags cannot be put on them and the cost-benefit can't even be guestimated.\"</span></p> <p><span>Adds Minnesota's Magrath, \"Political plat forms don't mean a darn thing.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Going Too Fast | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N A school system geared primarily toward accomodating the status quo, academically gifted children have always been a thorn in the side of educational policy makers.  If educators support funding for academic programs tailored to gifted students, they perpetuate the unjustified, though in most cases understandable, stigma of elitism surrounding such programs and risk alienating the parents of less talented children.  Conversely, if national policy makers neglect gifted children at the expense of the majority, those who have the money go to private schools, while those who cannot, become bored, unchallenged, and fall through the cracks of the school system.</span></p> <p><span>In 1971, educational researchers decided to take action.  Under the auspices of John Hopkins psychologist, started up the Center for Talented Youth (CTY), an organization aimed at identifying mathematically gifted students.  Since then, Duke, Northwestern.  Arizona State, and the University of Denver have organized talent searches modeled after the CTY experiment to identify precocious, intelligent youngsters and develop their untapped academic potential.</span></p> <p><span>The Hopkins program selects seventh and eighth graders who scored in the top three percent in a standardized test, to take the SAT, which is normally administered to students in their junior and senior years of high school.  To qualify for advanced courses offered in a special summer program at Hopkins, participants must score a 500 out of 800 on the mathematics portion of the exam or a 430 on the verbal.  Both scores are slightly above the national average for high school students.</span></p> <p><span>Recently, CTY again gained national attention for its efforts to seek out a larger number of potential prodigies.  Last year, 15,479 students participated in the program--selected from 80,000 youngsters under the age of 13 who took the test--according to statistics provided by the College Board.</span></p> <p><span>At a time when public education is so vulnerable to criticism from the outside, it is difficult to take issue with programs designed at raising the quality of education.  And, when such programs are privately subsidized, as in the case of CTY, the argument for the plan is even stronger.  Yet, as educators have pointed out, the legitimacy of such programs is suspect.  In fact, as Gregory Anrig, director of Educational Testing Services, asserts, the issue is not primarily an academic one, but rather the more ambiguous and controversial question of how, and at what expense, should advancement play a central role in a child's life.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>NE problem with the program is the potential social repercussion of accelerated education.  Though CTY does not encourage early entrance into college, many students do make use of their studies in the program to accelerate their academic careers, says talent search assistant Molly Longacre.</span></p> <p><span>Precocious 12 years olds may indeed be ready to tackle differential calculus at the level of elementary math courses here, but are they socially prepared to live in a communal living environment with peers six years their senior.  Are they even truly qualified at an age where many have yet to reach puberty to make such decisions?</span></p> <p><span>The likelihood of youngsters emerging socially maladjusted as a result of such acceleration is uncertain.  One participant who received his bachelors' degree from Johns Hopkins at 18 and is currently a professor at Northwestern told <i>The Washington Post</i> he experienced no real difficulties adjusting.  Yet even if such programs are innocuous the National Council of Teachers--fearful of the \"hurried child syndrome\"--has publicly denounced the Hopkins experiment.  And Anrig has also opposed CTY, wary that the net benefit students receive from the test might not compensate for the anxiety it produces.</span></p> <p><span>A change in College Board policy barring certain age groups from the exam might be an effective deterrent to a surge of teenage graduate students, but such procedural remedies skin the larger issue of how to stimulate gifted minds.  Opposition to programs like CTY is not the same as opposition to programs geared at academically students or standardized testing in general.  Opponents worried about inappropriate academic acceleration that inevitably results when pushy parents, precocious children, and higher learning institutions join forces.  Fortunately, with the mushrooming of advanced placement programs nationwide and increasing research on how to deal with gifted youngsters, the myth of the neglected gifted student is more fiction that fact.  And though public education, particularly in inner city schools, has fallen victim to President Reagan's band-aid educational policies, magnet schools and other specialized programs offer talented students an alternative to accelerated education.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HAT is really needed are programs that will successfully motivate and challenge students at the junior high and high school levels.  If Johns Hopkins and other institutions of higher learning like Harvard are truly interested in fostering excellence, they must appropriate their funds where they will do the most good.  Specifically, universities must help advanced placement programs in rural, oft neglected regions of the country where many gifted students go unnoticed, and bolster the quality and quality of offerings in those schools that already have solid programs.</span></p> <p><span>\"Academically gifted\" is admittedly, a nebulous term.  As such, it often makes formulating educational policy a complex task.  Yet, \"quality education,\" \"development of potential,\" and \"full capabilities\" are equally incalculable.  In attempting to center a talent search around the SAT which inevitably results in emphasizing college advancement and acceleration, the CTY and its followers may unintentionally be causing more harm--both to individuals and the educational system--than they realize.  Unfortunately, such harm is tough to measure on a 1 to 800 scale.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Stop the Cutbacks | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>One of the more unfortunate results of the Reagan years is the growing deafness among Americans to the sound of the Presidential axe.  Stunned by the harshness of the early Reagan budgets, the country has been unable to muster much opposition to successive plans, largely out of exhaustion.  When the budget for fiscal years 1985 was released last week, attention focused on the ballooning government deficit and overlooked the guaranteed social inequality and demolished programs that can be expected from Administration policies.</span></p> <p><span>The allocation, for higher education contained in the Reagan budget, should it be adopted, promises only to inflict further damage on our nation's universities.  The budget calls for cuts of $300 million in federally funded, need-based student programs including the elimination of Supplemental, Grants for school financial aid programs and National Direct Loans.</span></p> <p><span>At Harvard, financial aid officers are predicting a loss of one million dollars in supplemental grants if the proposals pass and increased difficulties for students trying to finance their educations due to decreased federal funds.</span></p> <p><span>At a time of rising tuition costs, the loss of such funds can only serve to make higher education, an important ingredient to social mobility, more inaccessible to the poor.  The drying up of federal funds will insure that universities remain homogeneous and the education they offer a privilege for the wealthy.</span></p> <p><span>The cuts are not compensated for by increased federal allotments to work-study programs for which students are not asked to contribute $500 before qualifying for such grants.</span></p> <p><span>For the past few years.  Reagan has sought to transfer more responsibility for education to the states.  This process will not be helped by the proposal elimination for the State incentive grant program in which states match funds allocated by Washington to set up scholarships.</span></p> <p><span>It has long been known that Reagan values destructive weapons more than constructive social programs.  The country can no longer expect him to understand that a better educated and more equitable society is an important step towards a sales America.

{"title": "Moving on Thin Ice | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>HEN ONE OF THEIR most respected legislators, former general Gert Bastian, withdrew from West Germany's Green Party last Thursday, the young party came one step closer to failure as a viable political institution.  More disturbing than Bastian's departure in itself, however, are the issues that prompted his resignation: increasingly heated internal power struggles and a gradual reformation of party priorities.</span></p> <p><span>But one of the problems is that of self-definition.  The Greens are a coalition of ecologists, peace activities, communists, and a few feminists.  Since coming to Parliament, however, the Greens have disagreed on many issues.  The main division is between the pragmatists who are interested in forming coalitions with the Social Democrats, and the fundamentalists for whom principles take precedence over any attempt at compromise.  Even the strain of everyday, working together seems to threaten this alliance Speaking of the that, the budget specialist of the Greens.  Hubert Kleinert, complains that we're moving on thin ice.\"</span></p> <p><span>Though Bastian may actually have had other reasons for resigning, his critique of the party struck several valid notes.  The Greens of the Bundestag have not yet had the benefit of being in-vigorated by success; consequently, it is not altogether surprising that they have turned much of their energy in-ward.</span></p> <p><span>For example, the recent, coordinated efforts of the Greens and the West German peace movement to oppose the Freshing IIs and the cruise missiles failed to prevent their deployment this fall. The Greens, however, are quick to took on the bright side of things.  \"It's not a failure.  It is clear that the government acted against the majority of the people, now there is a spirit of resignation,\" said Dr. Sabine Bard, a Green and member of the Bundestag, on a recent visit to Cambridge.  \"But at the next national election, people will remember who stood for what,\" another member noted.</span></p> <p><span>While in Cambridge, Bard also gave the following summary of her party's goals for a demilitarized central Europe.</span></p> <p><span>We voted against the stationing of the missiles because we want more independence from the West, while we hope East Germany becomes more independent from Russia.  For Europe, it would be an important step to have a nuclear free zone from Finland, through the Germanies, and down to Italy.  This would make it possible to have one Germany, but it would be a neutral nation, strictly without arms--we'd start [by eliminating] atomic weapons, but we're not quite sure how far we can go [in abolishing] conventional weapons.  We prefer the idea of a social defense which would have citizens refuse cooperation with the invading force.  After all, Germany is unattractive without its economic potential.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HOUGH SUCH AMBITIONS may be admirable for the virtue they implicitly impute to mankind, they are also a trifle naive.  Granted that the Greens themselves realize that their ultimate goals are nothing else than Utopian, one can hardly avoid questioning the maturity, at least the sincerity, of aspiring policymakers who propose relying on a program of civil disobedience in the face of a conquering totalitarian regime.</span></p> <p><span>What might otherwise be dismissed as merely a sign of excessive idealism is, in fact, symptomatic of a fundamental asymmetry in the Greens' view of the world.  The Greens have long shown a propensity to focus on the problems of the Western system, while they have been inclined, at the same time, to ignore the injustices of Eastern regimes and the relative advantages of the West.</span></p> <p><span>The Greens don't seem to realize, for example, that civil disobedience is something essentially peculiar to the West.  Though it is a good sign that West Germans can take many political liberties for granted, they ought not forget these rights are far from being universally respected.  The Greens should not admire their right to oppose the state so much that they neglect to exercise it; nevertheless, it would not be altogether inappropriate for the party to develop greater sensitivity in making assumptions about the application of that right, both in West Germany and in the East.</span></p> <p><span>The Greens have been characterized as anti-American.  This seems increasingly to be true, if only because their anti-nuclear efforts must necessarily be directed primarily against the United States Again, however, this should not be a reason for turning a blind eye to ward Soviet intransigence.  While the Soviets have taken it upon themselves to interrupt arms negotiations and Soviet development in Eastern Europe continues undaunted by concerns over needless escalation it is the Americans who have borne the brunt of the Greens antinuclear agitation.  Specifically, their attempt to set up a working coalition with the Social Democrats in Hesse has been hindered by demands such as the call for the demilitarization of the state The Greens not only seek a with-drawal of the American military, but outright secession from NATO.</span></p> <p><span>The Greens don't actually describe themselves as anti-American.  \"There's a big difference between the American people and the American government.  We feel closer to the American people than we do to our own government,\" said Bard.  Nevertheless, it must not be forgotten that almost all German leftists hold contempt for an America they see as incapable of producing leadership with any greater sophistication than Ronald Reagan and his \"cowboy mentality.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>M</b>ORE RECENTLY, the Greens seem to be giving some thought to giving their movement a bit more balance.  In Cambridge, Bard said.  \"The peace movement [in West Germany] is defeated at this point, but we have to go on and get in contact with the unofficial peace movement in the East.  We have very good contacts in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Poland.  We must work with them and not the governments to get Europe out of these two blocks, to get out of this East-West confrontation.\"</span></p> <p><span>In their parliamentary career to date, the Greens have not been tremendously successful.  \"We've made many proposals, but we've had only two legislative successes.  We stopped the importation of tortoise products, and we banned an insecticide.  We've developed many ideas so that they become concrete and so another party can  pick them up--the Parliament won't accept the initiatives from our mouths.  We're not working for the waste-paper basket.  This is very important, at least to us, psychologically,\" said Amim von Gleich, a member of the Greens executive board, in Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span>Both the Social and the Christian Democrats have laid claim to some of the Greens initiatives.  But the Greens have achieved much more than such vicarious successes.  They have made it impossible for the government to ignore popular opinions on nuclear disarmament and the environment.  Further more, they have almost certainly helped develop popular interest in the political process, both on their behalf and in opposition to the party.</span></p> <p><span>One distinctive feature of the Greens move into the Bundestag was their original resolve to rotate their Parliamentary seats among themselves every two years.  \"The theory was that politicking should not be a profession.  We didn't want to estrange our delegates from their regular lives,\" said vonGleich.  But recently even this policy has become a source of contention.  \"In practice, however, we're finding the mood is increasingly one of competition,\" von Gleich added.</span></p> <p><span>Bastian has been in the forefront of those opposed to rotation.  Only recently he demanded that those training to replace him and his fellow delegates be sent back to party headquarters where they would probably be more useful.  By resigning his position within the party but not his seat in Parliament.  Bastian avoids the possibility of being asked to step down prematurely.  But his departure also decreases the membership of the Green delegation (to the Bundestag) to only 27 legislators, precariously close to the minimum for an active delegation; if only two more delegates leave the party, it will lose many of its parliamentary privileges--including the federal subsidy--its vote on the various committees, and the power to introduce legislation.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>F THE GREENS are forced into such a passive role, it would mark a substantial setback for West German politics.</span></p> <p><span>While their strategic conceptions may lack a certain realism, the Greens have managed to introduce many important concerns into the political arena.  In their present form, provided they don't grow too powerful or become specifically anti-Parliamentarian, they are a sign of healthy democracy in West Germany.</span></p>"}

Running unopposed in his own party, Reagan can make use of all the brainpower available to the Republicans, tapping talent nurtured by the crowded 1980 Republican field, and drawing on the best operatives across the nation.

Hollings-are surrounded by experienced party operatives, veterans of the last four Democratic campaigns.  Others, like Colorado Sen. Gary W. Hart and Sen. Alan M. Cranston (D-Calif.), are stressing fresh blood, pulling in young people with high energy but little campaign background.  Former Sen. George S. McGovern and former Florida Gov. Reubin D. Askey are relying on home-state buddies and old supporters; the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson is building a team of minority leaders who recently helped propel several Blacks to mayoral posts around the country.</span></p> <p><span>For the first time in campaign history, all the organizations have women in high-ranking positions-and the candidates have been quick to publicize that fact in an attempt to woo the support of the nation's powerful women's groups.  No women are campaign managers or directors, but more than ever hold key secondtier posts.  At a recent debate, the hopefuls went so far as to tick off their prominent female staff members.  \"I'll see you one press secretary, and raise you a treasurer,\" one candidate joked.</span></p> <p><span>And though the names of campaign power bosses are unknown to the average voter, the hierarchy is clearly fixed for those on the inside.  Aides are quick to list those they see as holding the reins-and those perceptions differ little within each team.</span></p> <p><span>During the early months of the campaign, all the Democratic contenders scrambled for the allegiance of the seasoned campaign veterans.  Most successful by far was the former Vice President; the Mondale organization is generally considered to be the best-run Democratic campaign machine since the campaign of John F. Kennedy '40.  The team already sports well over 100 full-time staff members and more than 15 independent consultants; many are veterans of the two Carter/Mondale campaigns or the Mondale vice-presidency.</span></p> <p><span>Leading the team as acting chairman is James A. Johnson, a fellow Minnesotan who has worked with Mondale since 1972.  Johnson was Mondale's executive assistant in the White House, and the deputy director of the 1976 campaign.  Campaign manager Robert G. Beckel is the newest addition to the inner circle.  As the 'nuts and bolts' man of the campaign, Beckel an experienced operative who worked on the Carter campaign, oversees daily strategy decisions.  Top names in the Mondale campaign are also Michael Berman, treasurer and formerly Mondale's counsel in the White House, and Maxine Isaacs, his long-time press secretary and an up-and-coming power in the organization.</span></p> <p><span>Glenn's campaign is likewise composed of professional political operatives-but most are new to the candidate himself; Glenn's Senate staff has remained largely in their Senate office.  Instead, calling the shots are Bob Keefe, who travels with Glenn and helps him react to day-to-day crises, and campaign manager Jerry Vinto, a Boston native who rose to prominence in the 1980 Presidential bid of Mass. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54.</span></p> <p><span>Rather than delegating responsibility to the men in the field, Glenn until recently had reserved the final say on all strategy decisions to himself; some aides have attributed the campaign's early disorganization to this rigid centralization of administration.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike the highly professional Mondale and Glenn organizations, McGovern is relying on a close-meshed, down-home team to propel him into his desired third or fourth place in New Hampshire.  The man who runs the machine, George Cunningham, also ran McGovern's two congressional and five senatorial campaigns.  A fellow South Dakotan, Cunningham first met the candidate in 1954, working side-by-side with McGovern in South Dakota's Young Democrats organization.  He hasn't left the Senator's side since.  \"George McGovern and I go back a long way, to common roots and experience in the same state,\" Cunningham says.</span></p> <p><span>McGovern is also, quite literally, keeping his campaign in the family-his two daughters, Mary and Ann, manage the organization's finance and office administration respectively, and \"provide a lot of direction at the heart of the campaign,\" Cunningham says.</span></p> <p><span>But aides agree that the candidate is his own closest advisor.  McGovern reportedly makes all the major decisions, writes much of his own material, and often speaks extemporaneously.  \"His statements aren't filtered through a lot of people,\" Cunningham says, adding, \"What you see is what you get-George McGovern undiluted.\"</span></p> <p><span>By contrast, such personal involvement in all levels of the campaign is exactly what aides say Hart is trying to avoid.  Campaign manager Oliver Henkel explains that Hart, himself McGovern's 1972 campaign manager, \"knows from personal experience how distinct the roles of candidate and campaign manager must remain.  You can't wear two hats at once,\" he adds.  Hart tries to leave strategy and tactical decisions almost entirely up to his senior staff-\"for better or worse, he takes all my advice,\" says Henkel.</span></p> <p><span>Such reliance is somewhat surprising because Henkel admits he brings no political background to the job.  A classmate of Hart's from Yale Law School, Henkel quietly practiced law in Cleveland for 19 years until Hart called him last year and asked him to manage his campaign.  \"I told him he probably had the wrong man,\" says Henkel, \"but he wanted fresh blood in the process-he didn't want the campaign to be run like the others.  \"Henkel adds that Hart, a naturally shy man, was also \"anxious to have someone who wouldn't try to change his public persona.\"</span></p> <p><span>The other distinctive feature of the Hart campaign is its youth-most of the top positions are filled by people in their late 20s.  Some key staffers are even younger-the man who heads Hart's delegate selection effort is a junior at Yale, and the organization's computer expert is a 14-year-old American University sophomore.</span></p> <p><span>Like Hart, Cranston's candidacy depends on coming in third place today, according to campaign manager Sergio Bendixen.  The senior staffers in his organization, including Bendixen himself, are almost all new to the candidate-a few have been involved in previous Presidential efforts, but most are \"young people who've never been in any Presidential campaign before,\" Bendixen says.  Like Hart, Cranston lets his campaign manager make all the decisions, except for the \"general game plan;\" Bendixen calls that an \"ideal arrangement so far.\"</span></p> <p><span>The staff of the Jackson campaign, by contrast, are entirely subordinate to the candidate himself.  According to assistant press secretary Eric Easter, Jackson \"is the sole decision maker\" in that organization-he determines issue stands, arranges his schedules, preps himself for interviews.  His senior staffers are mostly minorities who have worked with him for a long time; the two to watch are campaign manager Arnold Pinkney, a veteran of Andrew Young's Atlanta mayoral race and a one-time candidate for mayor of Cleveland; and Preston Love, a computer specialist who has advised both Young and Chicago Mayor Harold Washington.</span></p> <p><span>The two trailing candidates, Askew and Hollings, would both view a fourth place finish as a \"moral victory,\" aides say, but they're running their campaign organizations very differently to achieve that goal.  The top people in Askew's campaign are old acquaintances from his days in Miami, says campaign manager Jim Krog; the candidate will have to do well in New Hampshire to overcome his image as a regional candidate.  As for strategy decisions, Krog says, \"I call the shots.\"</span></p> <p><span>That final word is a privilege Hollings reserves for himself, says Brooks Fudenberg, the candidate's press assistant.  And in contrast to McGovern's staff of old faithfuls, Hollings's top staff have only recently met him, though many have had substantial political experience.  The campaign chairman is the current president of Duke University, Terry Sanford, who once served as governor of North Carolina and launched an abortive Presidential bid of his own in 1972.  The campaign director, Curt Moffatt, was the senior advance man for Arizona Rep.  Morris Udall and later in 1976 for Carter as well, and is active in the Democratic National Committee's fundraising and rules committees.</span></p> <p><span>So today's New Hampshire results, like those throughout the election, depend largely on the \"invisible\" men and women-the ones who, as many note, \"just never stop moving.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Buck Starts Here | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>M</b>ONEY HAS always been the life blood of a Presidential campaign, but most campaign wisemen agree that never before has the umbilical cord between dollars and votes been so strong.</span></p> <p><span>Congress has made efforts to limit fundraising free-for-alls, but, for every campaign finance limitation, political operatives seem to have dreamed up a way to get around it.  And while many purists cry \"foul play\" from the sidelines, Republicans operatives are out-soliciting and out-spending their counterparts by often staggering margins.</span></p> <p><span>Expenditures on the '84 Presidential campaign are expected to hit record highs, surpassing the $106.6 million spent on the 1980 contests by 10 to 30 percent.  The lion's share of this increase, according to election officials, will come from the bank account of the Republican National Committee (RNC).  Last year, the organization raised more than two and a half times the contributions garnered by the parallel Democratic National Committee (DNC).</span></p> <p><span>Add to this the hefty expenditures for candidates made by \"independent\" political action committees (PACs)--also weighted toward the conservative end of the ideological spectrum-- and the Republicans can expect to enjoy the best campaign money can buy.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, as if its fundraising edge were not substantial enough, the GOP can target all its resources for the November run-off, while Democratic hopefuls throw their funds into their nomination bids.</span></p> <p><span>What makes the dollars so important are recent changes in the delegate selection process and, paradoxically, campaign finance legislation that have put a premium on high-cost politicking.  Especially in primaries, the race often goes to the candidate who has purchased the most media coverage and funded the most extensive telephone and direct mail campaigns.  The advance of more sophisticate and more expensive compute technology, has helped widen this spending gap.</span></p> <p><span>The Republicans have been quick to turn these advanced solicitation tactics to their success.  According to RNC officials, the bulk of the $35 million they collected during 1983 came from donations of $50 or less.  That sum is more than twice the $17 million the committee collected in advance of the 1980 race.</span></p> <p><span>Not only technology, but also politics, have paved the way for the successful GOP shakedown The invasion of Grenada and downing of the Korean Airlines jet by the Soviet Union created a surge in Reagan's popularity that found its financial expression in campaign contributions, RNC financial director Philip Smith says.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the RNC's contributions are solicited through direct mailings run by outside consulting firms.  The committee snags roughly 20 percent of its donations from several business donor organizations, such as the \"Republican Eagle program,\" whose members each contribute between $10,000 and the legal maximum of $20,000.</span></p> <p><span>The DNC has tried to keep pace with the smoothly-oiled Republican machine, but with considerably less success.  The committee has thus far raised far less than the GOP's $35 million, and several campaign officials blaim the lag on peer management in the DNC camp.  These critics point to the $2.8 million loss on a highly publicized telethon last September, which DNC Chairman Charles T. Manatt and either committee members estimated would set a record $10 to $20 million.  And a December fundraising tour raised barely half of its projected $2.5 million gain.</span></p> <p><span>Individual candidates have tried to compensate for limited party funds by raising unprecedented amounts for their individual campaigns.  Former Vice-President Walter F. Mondale and Sen. John H. Glenn (D-Ohio) lead the pack by a country mile, with each collecting more than twice the contributions of their nearest Democratic rival.  Both Mondale and Glenn have raised more money in 1983 than former President Jimmy Carter stockpiled four years before.</span></p> <p><span>The Mondale financial machine is probably in the strongest shape.  Timothy Finchem, finance director for Mondale, says the campaign has stayed out of debt (unlike Glenn's) and has yet to lose its early momentum.  Finchem explains, \"An important aim of the campaign is to secure the Democratic nomination early in the primaries so that we can concentrate on developing a base of financial support for the final election.\"</span></p> <p><span>Not all efforts have run so smoothly.  Paul A. Rosenberg '75, finance director for Glenn attributes the recent stagnation in the Senator's fundraising campaign to temporary factors, but rival finance officials claim Glenn has now exhausted support within his home state of Ohio, and has been unable to build a strong national base for fundraising.</span></p> <p><span>The other Democratic contenders lag even further behind Mondale, and may be severely hamstrung by their lack of funds.  McGovern, who entered the race last October, has collected less than $30,000 compared to Mondale's $11 and Glenn's $7 million.  The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson has thus far raised close to $500,000.</span></p> <p><span>The disparity between Mondale's seeming financial ease and other, more impoverished, campaigns has not gone unnoticed; several officials from rival campaigns complain that Mondale's early backing from labor unions has given him an unfair advantage in the race, allowing him to exceed the limits on state campaign spending set by the Federal Election Commission (FEC).  \"Not only can he exploit union mail and union workers without having this spending registered with FEC,\" Woodward Wilson, a top McGovern staffer, says.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Fuding The Numbers | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>THERE'S ONLY ONE THING WORSE than intense ideological conservatism mindless ideological conservatism.  A case in point is Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger '38's Pentagon, which is rapidly gaining a name for itself not only as an advocate of unrelenting military build up, but also as an institution with no compunction about fuding the numbers to keep its already over swollen budget swelling.</span></p> <p><span>The latest news from the capital of the military industrial complex courtesy of the independent Congressional Budget Office is that the Pentagon's briefcase toters conveniently underestimated the inflation rate by several points for the next several years.  According to the <i>The Boston Globe,</i>which first broke the story this week this means that the nation's defense program could cost more than $100 billion above the costs currently projected by the Pentagon.</span></p> <p><span>Whoops! Just a mistake, you can hear the Defense department bureaucrats straggling to apologize.  Just misplaced that little pinky on the calculator.  The litany of excuses for this error are surely being prepared by Defense Department flaks at this very moment.  And in a normal period eg-regious as the potential cost overrun is, we would be satisfied with the stingiest of mea culpas.</span></p> <p><span>But the latest Pentagon boo-boo falls into an all too predictable pattern of willful misrepresentation that has come to characterize the Weinbergian spending and procurement process.  A curious mind set has come to accompany the staggering arms build up Weinberger and Reagan have embarked on an outlook that consistently underestimates the costs of the fancy weapons systems the Administration wants and consistently miscalculates the nature of the military threat posed by our adversaries.</span></p> <p><span>The former point has been driven home most forcefully by Pentagon \"whistle blower\" Franklin C. Spinney, who in 1983 told Congressmen that the Defense Department consistently under budgets its weapons programs and takes on more programs than it can reasonably expect to efficiently complete.  This tendency seems borne of the same mentality that sees a monolithic, unbeatable Soviet army read to pounce on the West, while disregarding the poor caliber and internal rifts of that army which make such an invasion unlikely.</span></p> <p><span>No one is denying that the world is an increasingly dangerous place in which U.S. vigilance and sobriety is sorely called for to meet whatever military challenges may arise.  But this shouldn't mean that the American public has to hand over a blank check to the Pentagon especially when it can't be sure that check is going to be cashed wisely.  Many have claimed that the U.S. armed forces banks too much on overly complicated weapons systems that are prone to excessive cost overruns and might not work on the battle field the M-1 tank and the F-18 fighter plane are two examples of this trend.  The current Pentagon's proclivity to avoid reality in its budgetary planning as evinced in the latest inflation numbers scam can only exacerbate this tendency.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan now wants more than $300 billion in his next defense budget and Weingerger is pressing hard to make sure most of this gets through Congress.  Congress shouldn't give him it at least until he gets a new calculator.</span></p>"}
{"title": "King of the Hill | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\"The numbers are definitely on our side, \" brags Walt Witich, a Democratic Party political operative.</span></p> <p><span>A GOP counterpart, Steve Letterer, responds, \"There's a Republican wind blowing out there.\"</span></p> <p><span>Both politicos are talking about the same thing-this year's bevy of congressional races, 33 in the Senate and 435 in the House of Representatives, to be exact.</span></p> <p><span>The stakes are big; for the first time this century the two houses have been under split control for more than two consecutive years. Both sides think they can, at the very least, make strides towards changing that around.  And this strange presidential year, both sides may be right.</span></p> <p><span>Democrats like Witich, research director of the party's senatorial campaign committee, are banking on the odds.  For the first time in three senate elections, Republicans up for reelection outnumber Democrats-19 to 14.  With more ducks to shoot at, Democrat pols think they have a chance to win back the control of the senate they lost in 1980, although because they are down 55-45, the chances of this are slim.</span></p> <p><span>Republicans, conversely, hope that they will be able to ride the coattails of Ronald Reagan and his economic recovery and bite into the Democrats 268-167 advantage in the House.  Letterer has just returned from a nation-wide trip with Rep. Guy Vander Jagt (R-Mich.), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, and says he found \"people optimistic about the future and waiting to vote Republican.  It's a complete turnaround from 1982, when everyone was depressed about the economy.\"</span></p> <p><span>But the fanciful scenarios that dance through a politico's head, can be a far cry from what is likely.  No one expects both the election of a Democratic president and, say, a turn to the right in Congress.  More to the point, no one is really expecting the Republicans to make any major inroads into the Democratic majority in the House.  The real action is going to be in the Senate, where a shift of six seats could return the Democrats to the top perch and return important committee chairmanships to senators like Sam Nunn (Armed Forces), Edward M. Kennedy (Labor and Human Resources), and Lloyd Bentsen (Environment and Public Works).</span></p> <p><span>\"The absolute best the Republicans can hope for in the House is to gain a few of the 26 seats they lost in 1982, and even that won't give them a working coalition with conservative Democrats,\" says Norman Ornstein, a political science professor at Catholic University in Washington, D.C.  \"But in the Senate they face a real challenge,\" Ornstein adds.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's a tough situation ahead of us,\" admits one Republican National Committee strategist, Ceci Cole.  \"Our incumbents are vulnerable and half of the Democratic incumbents are from bedrock Democratic states.\"</span></p> <p><span>Democrats are especially confident because, of the 19 Republican Senate seats up for grabs, eight incumbents won their elections with 55 percent or less of the vote.  The conventional wisdom held by full-time pols is that 55 is the magic number for determining whether a seat is vulnerable or not.</span></p> <p><span>While Democrats have numbers on their side, however, Republican candidates in the country have a few things going for them.  Not the least of which is that, for all the trends moving in their direction, the Democrats still have a lot of ground to make up.</span></p> <p><span>Even in a good year, a swing of six seats is a lot-especially if they come from a party that far outdistances the other in terms of money and organization.</span></p> <p><span>As a group, the Senate Republicans are now projected to outspend their Democratic opponents by an up to 10:1 margin and will reach in each state the maximum dollar figure a national party organization can legally spend.  In the 1982 congressional races, the Republicans outspent the Democratic campaign committees by 4 to 1, and while the Democrats are expected to do better this time out, they won't even be able to come close to matching the GOP war chest.</span></p> <p><span>What's more, even the best of Dems are envious of Republican organizational skills.  Ornstein says the Republicans are better at spending their money.  That is, because their funding organizations are tightly centralized, they can carefully target funds towards close races.  Democratic funding organizations, by contrast, are more decentralized and those candidates who need large sums of cash are often left in the lurch while runaway winners sometimes find huge chunks of money in their treasuries when their campaigns are over.</span></p> <p><span>Democrats have already unleashed a strong challenge in North Carolina and Iowa, where the most interesting races of the year have begun to shape up.</span></p> <p><span>The celebrated North Carolina race--which some say will overshadow the Presidential race in rhetoric if not reality--pits the scourge of right wing conservatism, Sen. Jesse Helms, against Democratic Gov. James B. Hunt, Jr. Polls taken late last year put the popular Hunt-progressive in Southern terms--ahead of Helms by as much as 20 points, though more recent polls show that Helms has closed the gap.</span></p> <p><span>In what promises to be one of the most expensive races in the country, Democrats hope to counter superior Republican fundraising ability with a flood of Black voter registration, which is likely to aid Democratic candidates throughout the South.</span></p> <p><span>In Iowa, Republican incumbent Roger W. Jepsen, has also closed a polling gap on his Democratic challenger Rep.  Tom Harkin.  But Iowa seems to have a distaste for incumbents--no senator has won a second term there since 1966 Senate Majority leader Howard Baker's decision to step down in Tennessee induced the popular Democrat Rep.  Albert Gore Jr. to make a bid for the seat.  Gore will probably benefit from a fractious Reublican primary, in which an extreme right-wing religious leader has been viciously attacking his moderate foe.</span></p> <p><span>Texas, where Sen. John Tower is retiring, presents a different situation, because a difficult Democratic primary is expected before the winner faces likely Republican nominee Rep.  Phil Gramm.  Tower squeaked by with 50 percent in his 1978 election.</span></p> <p><span>Democrats would particularly like to unseat prominent Sen.  Charles H. Percy of Illinois, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.  Although a moderate on social issues, Percy has stood quietly, but staunchly, behind President Reagan's economic program.  He faces a strong challenge from the right, from the more uniformly conservative Rep.  Tom Corcoran, in what will probably be the only GOP primary for an incumbent.</span></p> <p><span>The most attractive Democratic candidate in Illinois would probably be Rep.  Paul Simon, who is stepping down from the Congressional seat he has held for ten years.  But Simon, whose vocal support for higher education funding as chairman of the House Subcommittee on Post-secondary Education has helped win him respect from liberals, must overcome three rivals in the Democratic primary.</span></p> <p><span>Other vulnerable Republican Senators include Thad Cochran of Mississippi, who, like Helms and Jepsen, has trailed his Democratic challenger in polls, Gordon J. Humphrey of New Hampshire, and Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota.  Observers say Walter F. Mondale, also from Minnesota, could play a role in Boschwitz's fate, if he lands the Democratic presidential nomination.  Mondale's ticket would rouse a strong Democratic turnout at the Minnesota polls in November.</span></p> <p><span>Republicans, on the other hand, could mount particularly strong challenges in Rhode Island and West Virginia, but they have not yet been able to persuade their first-choice candidates to challenge the Democratic incumbents.</span></p> <p><span>In Rhode Island, everyone, including GOP officials, has said that Rep.  Claudine Schneider will not run for the seat held by four-term Sen.  Claiborne Pell.  Everyone except Schneider herself, that is, who says she is still pondering a shot at the Senate.</span></p> <p><span>GOP attempts to draft former West Virginia Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr. in the race against present Gov. John D. Rockefeller IV have so far been unsuccessful.  Moore could provide Rockefeller with a tough fight for the seat from which long-time Senator Jennings Randolph is retiring.</span></p> <p><span>House races will surely be less tumultuous than the Senate because less is at stake.  Republicans would have to make extraordinary gains to challenge the majority control Democrats have held in the House for 28 years.  And in House races, where issues are generally less important than personality factors, nationwide trends tend to blur in significance.  Still, insiders who talk about the races make a few basic points:</span></p> <p><span>Republicans and Democrats agree that the 52 Democratic freshmen form the critical group in the House elections.</span></p> <p><span>Voting trends show that the country is becoming more sympathetic to incumbents after a period of hostility spurred by Watergate.  Republicans want to nip the Democratic freshmen in the bud before they gain the vaunted status of political old-timers.</span></p> <p><span>Republican strategy, according to Republican Lotterer, is to cast the races as a \"Reagan vs. Mondale-O'Neill\" contest.  Lotterer says that the Democratic freshmen have simply fallen in lockstep behind effective Democratic party leader Rep.  Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.), whose old-fashioned liberalism he thinks is out of favor with much of the electorate.</span></p> <p><span>But Johnson of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee argues that \"our people aren't ideological like the 52 Republican freshmen who won in 1980.\"</span></p> <p><span>14 of those 52 Republicans fell in 1982, but Johnson says the Democrats will not suffer similar losses because \"our freshmen won't rise and fall with Mondale.\"</span></p> <p><span>An important factor working against House Republicans is the scant likelihood that they will assume majority status within the next three or four elections, observers say.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's awfully depressing to know you may not be in the House majority, even in your lifetime,\" says Ornstein.</span></p> <p><span>Ornstein noted the retirement of respected Republican New York representative, Barner B. Conable Jr., as an example of about a halfdozen senior House GOP members who are stepping down this year.</span></p> <p><span>Democrats in national organizations and those in Congressional offices cite the new Democratic \"media center\"-at which candidates can produce commercials for one-third the cost charged by independent media firms--as a factor in their chances.  Republicans have long had such a production facility, and Democrats hope the center will alleviate some of their financial woes.</span></p> <p><span>Some of the interesting races involve rematches between House freshmen and the Republican incumbents they defeated, although in this area too, a Republican weakness is evident.</span></p> <p><span>Republican difficulty in convincing defeated Republicans to run again has forced the GOP to cool its rhetoric.  So after the Democrats picked up 28 seats in the 1982 elections, GOP spokesmen talked of 20 more rematches.  These days, Vander Jagt boasts of a possible 10.</span></p> <p><span>A few of the lively rematches:</span></p> <p><span>Democratic freshman Bruce Morrison of Connecticut, at 39 seemingly too young for his New Deal Politics, faces Larry DeNardis, an exponent of the Italian-American machine politics which has dominated his New Haven district since the fifties.  Morrison nipped DeNardis 50 to 49 percent in 1982.</span></p> <p><span>Freshman Lane Evans of Illinois faces Kenneth G. McMillan, a hardline conservative who won the 1982 GOP primary over then Rep.  Tom Railsback, largely because Railsback was implicated in the Paula Parkinson sex scandal. in Illinois, along with Texas, the Democrats expect to make their biggest House gains, and Evans' district, which is fairly representative of Illinois outside of Chicago, is a watermark for Democratic chances.</span></p> <p><span>One of the most expensive and prominent House races will pit Democratic Rep.  James K. Jones (D-Okla.) against the winner of a Republican primary in which both contenders have already spent more than $1 million each.  Jones parallels the conservative Democrat, but as Chairman of the House Budget Committee, he has done as much as any congressman to dismantle the Reagan economic program.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Preaching to the Unconverted | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>\"W</b>HY IS everyone so interested in voter registration?\" asks longtime civil rights activist James E. Madison.  \"It all has to do with what I call Plato's theory to defeat apathy:  you either provide people with an incentive or you expose a devil-this year we've got both.\"</span></p> <p><span>Madison, of course, is referring to the Presidency of Ronald Reagan and the candidacy of the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson. Reagan gets liberals angry; Jackson is actively trying to appeal to a class of voters traditionally underrepresented in the voting population.  Together, they are helping spur one of the largest get-out-the-vote efforts in recent history. Not since the succession of marches in the South that prompted the voting Rights Act of 1965 has there been such avid interest in voter registration.  While traditional groups like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the League of Women Voters remain on the scene, the past three years have seen a proliferation of new groups and strategies-from both ends of the political spectrum-hoping to affect the 1984 election by registering voters.</span></p> <p><span>Today, a myriad of both partisan and nonpartisan groups are organizing voter registration drives targeted at a variety of specific audiences.  The Southwest Voter Education Project is aiming to register Hispanic voters in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.  Project VOTE wants to reach people in cheese and unemployment lines, and Frontlash is gunning for voting-age youths.  Meanwhile, from the right side of the spectrum, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is putting together a booklet to encourage businessmen to vote, and the Republican National Committee is making special efforts to enlist members of the armed forces and evangelicals.</span></p> <p><span>A lot of this effort is utilitarian.  Concern even about the long-range effects of low voter turnout on a democratic society notwithstanding, both political parties are keenly aware of the impact a rise in the amount of voters could have on the election.</span></p> <p><span>In 1980, 53.9 percent of eligible voters-or about 87 million people-voted in the November general election. Walter F.Mondale's campaign manager.  James Johnson, has told reporters that the Democrats should be able to reverse their 1980 Josses if they can bring that percentage up to 57 or 58. Especially important in such calculations are a ream of electoral votes.  Thirteen states that Reagan carried in 1980 have unregistered voters exceeding Reagan's respective margins of victory there, including Massachusetts, New York, and Mississippi.</span></p> <p><span>Just focusing on unregistered Black voters gives an indication of the untapped power at the hands of the Parties. Nine in 10 Blacks vote for Democrats and that figure may well be even worse for Republicans in 1984, since Reagan's approval rating with Blacks has sunk below 10 percent.  In Massachusetts alone, where Reagan carried the state by less than 3000 votes, drawing some of the more than 60,000 unregistered Blacks to the polls could make a difference.  \"In mary of these cases, had one third of the unregistered Blacks voted, Mr. Reagan would not have been elected President,\" says Madison.  \"The hands that once picked cotton can now pick the President-and they know that.\"</span></p> <p><span>That's why Democratic bigwigs know that Jackson's candidacy is bound to help the party in the long run; his efforts at registering voters in the South will prove handy in November though his snipes at Mondale now cause friction. And this is why the Democratic National Committee-as well as a smattering of other, liberal groups-is channeling $2 million into community based voter registration efforts.</span></p> <p><span>But voter registration is not the sole province of the Democrats and liberals.  Although they face tougher going, the Republicans are also going after new voters.  Together, the Reagan Bush reelection camp and the Republican National Committee are planning to spend $10 million in the hopes of registering between two and two and a half million new voters.  \"There are 53 million unregistered votes out there, and it's a good bet they're not all Black,\" says campaign aide John Buckley.</span></p> <p><span>But there's no denying the registration game is trickier for the GOP.  Most polls, for instance, show that two-thirds of newly registered voters would support the Democrats-a statistic that reflects the deep disaffection that several minority groups have for Reagan.  Voter registration could be the campaign fiasco that leaves egg all over the collective GOP face, which is why Republicans are spending so much money for relatively few votes.  But they are treading carefully.  The Republicans and their allies especially the Chamber of Commerce and the Moral Majority-want to tap only those constituencies they are after-in particular businessmen, young professionals, people who live near army bases, and evangelical Christians; otherwise, they could awaken a sleeping giant.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>MBITIOUS INTENTIONS not-withstanding, however, both parties face a number of stumbling blacks in their registration efforts.  These are both struc- tural and attitudinal.  In the Southwest, for instance, racial gerrymandering--that is, setting district boundaries which divide minority blocs--polarizes voters, critics charge.  \"In these areas, if you're in the minority, you can't win, so [the attitude is:] why vote?\"  says William C. Velasquez, director of the Southwest Voter Education Project.</span></p> <p><span>Even when the desire to vote is strong, structural barriers to voter registration persist in a host of states.  \"The states impose maximum impediments on registration,\" former President Jimmy Carter said last fall at a symposium on voter registration sponsored by Harvard and ABC News.  \"It is almost impossible to figure out how, in a convenient way, to become registered,\" he said.  Carter's lament is borne out by the proliferation of rules and regulations in some states that make it downright difficult to get to the voting booth.  Despite the provisions of the Voting Rights Act, which was designed to eliminate discriminatory registration rules, many states continue to prohibit postcard and door-to-door registration--a move which disproportionately affects poor and minority voters.  Some states still require voters to register and both municipal <i>and</i> county seats; in Mississippi, citizens may have to travel 70 miles to register, and in North Carolina's Graham County, a citizen can only register on Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons.</span></p> <p><span>Conservative groups also have to deal with the proliferation of complicated registration rules from state to state.  The book put out by the Chamber of Commerce, for instance, is intended \"to lead business people through the morass of voter registration laws,\" says John A. Kochvar, director of the Chamber's Political Action Committee.  The Chamber has targeted managerial and corporate employees, whose voting power, they believe, is diluted by their high mobility and frequent travel on election days.</span></p> <p><span>Efforts to loosen the rules concerning voter registration have not met with much success in recent years, despite the energy focused in the problem.  \"The decision-makers in the legislature are unwilling to open up the process because of political concerns,\" says David Sullivan, a Cambridge city councilor and Massachusetts election official.  \"They don't want to be responsible to a larger constituency.\"</span></p> <p><span>But the registration groups--especially on the Left--are beginning to come up with some innovative ways of adding names to the voter rolls.  Project VOTE, for instance, is an organization that tries to enlist low-income voters by setting up registration tables in food stamp and unemployment lines and housing projects.  \"We tell them that the social programs--for which they are in line--being cut affect poor people and minorities, and that their failure to register and vote has elected those responsible,\" says Alan Raby, an official with the program.  Efforts like these, moreover, are being helped no end by the Jackson candidacy.  \"You've never had a Presidential candidate who has put this kind of emphasis on registration,\" says Madison, who works for the NAACP.  \"He's forcing a lot of politicians to do registration just to compete with him.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Reaganaut | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>HOW MUCH will Ronald Reagan win by?</span></p> <p><span>While they won't all admit it this has to be the question on pundits minds this year as they take a candid look at the upcoming presidential year.  Few incumbents have ever entered their reelection campaigns in as commanding a position as Reagan does this year:  certainly even fewer have so easily convinced the media and the general public of it.  Three years into his presidency, Reagan still is coasting on an approval rating that hovers in the 60 percent range.  He has posted an impressive series of legislative victories and is gaining a lion's share of the credit for the current economic recovery.</span></p> <p><span>All this of course could go poof in the wake of say a foreign policy disaster in Lebanon or Central America.  But what really makes the professional handicappers hanker to place their bets on the Reagan Bush team is a campaign machine that is one of the best greased and best organized in history.</span></p> <p><span>Democratic front runner Walter F. Mondale has garnered a lot of attention for the nearly $5 million he has raised thus far.  But compared to the bulging Reagan coffers, the Mondale money is practically peanuts.  Just since Reagan filed his formal candidacy papers with the Federal Election Commission last October, his campaign has raised nearly $8 million.  Campaign officials think they'll raise the rest of the $21 million they are legally allowed to spend on the campaign by April.  Furthermore, they will have the luxury of not having to spend all this loot acquired mostly through a state of the art direct mail fundraising campaign on a series of primaries and caucuses.  Instead, the GOP will be able to use most of it to bash the Democratic nominee over the head come fall.</span></p> <p><span>What's more, Reagan will be helped significantly by a host of independent spending campaigns by conservative groups around the country.  Campaign laws have allowed groups like the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC) to spend as much money as they like in support of a candidates as long as they are not in cahoots with the regular campaign, NCPAC, for instance has budgeted $2 million for an independent campaign for Reagan as well as a $2 million campaign \"to expose the liberal voting record of Walter F. Mondale,\" says NCPAC spokesman Craig Shirley.  While some observers believe the negative campaign against Mondale might backfire, the Reagan campaign can't help but be boosted by the positive NCPAC expenditures, part of which are going to fund a half hour film, Ronald Reagan's America, and a 200 page book tentatively entitled Reagan:  A Record of Achievement.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan also has the entire resources of the Republican Party a his disposal not least of which are the sophisticated PR, media, and high tech skills of its top strategists.  The Reagan '84 campaign boasts many of the same key players that carried the '80 juggernaut like campaign chairman, Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev); campaign manager, Edward Rollins; the pollster Richard Wirthlin; and White House advisers James Baker and Michael K. Deaver.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is only one Republican candidate,\" says one campaign yet who's not around for the ride this time the ex White House Communication Director, David R. Gergen.  He says, \"All the sharpshooters are in the same fort Reagan will derive tremendous benefit from this.\"  The one major campaign post yet unfilled is that of media coordinator though Republican officials predict the job will likely to Peter Daly, who did the job in 1980.</span></p> <p><span>JUST AS Reagan has had an uncanny ability to define the political agenda over the last three years, he is going fortnightly about making himself the issue in the upcoming campaign.  He's turned around the economy, he has America \"standing tall again,\" and he's not going to let the voters forget it.  Still, Reagan has to get enough people to pull the lever for him come November.  Pollsters estimate that the incumbent commands a devoted following among about 35 percent of the electorate a larger base than either Gerald Ford of Jimmy Carter had at the time of their election.</span></p> <p><span>But that's not enough to win the whole thing either in terms of popular or electoral vote and the last three years have seen an erosion of support for Reagan in some of the key groups and regions that carried him to victory in 1980.  Reagan's relative lack of support among women, Blacks and labor unions could mean the loss of large industrial states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Illinois, which Reagan was able to carry narrowly in 1980.  This would in turn increase the pressure on Reagan to hold his bedrock conservative constituencies in the South and the West.</span></p> <p><span>Throwing a monkey wrench into all the GOP calculations is the extensive voter registration efforts going on around the country on behalf the Democratic.  \"We're the minority party in the country,\" says Reagan campaign side Buckley.  \"If the Democrats register one voter for every Republican they'll have a chance in November.\"</span></p> <p><span>Republican operatives, however, have started registration delivers of their own and believe they can make in reads into some heretofore untapped sources of support.  As one official puts it, \"with a 58 percent approved rating, it's possible to expect that there are a lot of people who have not been involved in the political process out there who are pro-Reagan.  \"Republican certainly aren't expecting to make significant inroads into the Black community, where Reagan's standing is at about the worst it could possibly be.  A recent Gallup poll shows that only 10 percent of the Black community approved of the way Reagan is preferring his.  But GOP operatives think that they gain some new votes from groups.  The Hispanic Asian Americans evangelical Christians and people in the armed forces.</span></p> <p><span>In 1980 for instatance, Reagan resolved only a third of the Hispanic vote.  But record polling indicate he has gained some strength in the community and extra work there could pay off especially in states like Texas and California.  \"Issues of interest to Hispanic such as the family, education and enterpreneurship actively and Reagan issues,\" says Buckley.  Buckley adds that in Texas, Florida and California, there are 650,000 members of the armed forces who are not registered to vote, but who he says likely Reagan supporters.</span></p> <p><span>On top of the money organization and strategy, of course lies the Republicans' biggest asset--Reagan's enormous personal charisma. and style.  But exactly when he takes that style out of the Rose Garden and goes directly to the voters remains unclear.  For the meantime, while there are no contested Republican primaries this year both Reagan and Bush will make appearances in states at the time of the Democratic contests.</span></p> <p><span>\"Come fall, he'll be out among the voters,\" predicts Gergen.  \"It was a tactical mistake in 1980 to hide Reagan early.  People underestimated him.  He's a lot more effective out in the open.</span></p>"}
{"title": "They'll Be Watching Us | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>HILE Presidential candidates from both political camps try to woo an often disinterested electorate, they are often oblivious to a group of avid onlookers--foreign governments who recognize the outcome of the U.S. Presidential race could significantly affect their own futures.</span></p> <p><span>It is still too early for most foreigners to distinguish between the Democratic candidates, but President Reagan's tenure has given most nations a clear indication of what four more years of the Administration might mean.  After the primaries have determined which Democrat will challenge Reagan, most analysts feel more world attention will be focused on the American political race.</span></p> <p><span>For the moment, Reagan, who still carries substantial backing at home, does not enjoy parallel support overseas.  Though by no means uniformly opposed to Reagan, many foreign leaders have voiced their dislike of elements of his foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span>Across the Atlantic, the most prominent American policy issues are the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  American-Soviet nuclear arms negotiations, and the Middle East conflict.  These issues appear to have tipped the continental balance against Reagan.  Dillion Professor of International Affairs Raymond Vernon Claims he has \"never seen such a separation from the United States culture and economy, such discontentment over foreign policy decisions of the U.S. government in all the 35 years I've been following European political thought,\" although he qualifies that this view is based on limited conversations.</span></p> <p><span>Europeans refer to Reagan as the \"Emperor President,\" Vernon says, to express a perception that he moves without any thought of consulting European allies.  The President's decision to withdraw American troops from Lebanon without consulting the French and British military about possible ramifications for their troops' security, has helped to reinforce this view.  It has been interpreted as the latest in a series of alienating foreign policy moves on the part of the Reagan Administration.</span></p> <p><span>The French have been unhappy with American foreign policy for the last 15 years, and the present estrangement from U.S. government is just a slight intensification of that trend, Vernon says.  In terms of the election, the French prefer any change to Reagan, but at the same time, no attempt has been made to distinguish between the Democratic alternatives.  The Italians, like the French, have become more embittered toward the United States under Reagan, particularly in the wake of the recent Euromissile deployment.</span></p> <p><span>Although Reagan shares a greater ideological solarity with the conservative governments of Britain's Margaret Thatcher and West Germany's helmut Kohi-in marked constrast to the socialist regimes of France and Italy-his appeal in these countries is limited as well West Germany has expressed unease over the U.S. role in the NATO alliance and British critics have also attacked Reagan's foreign policy beyond the realm of European politics; Neil Kinnock, a leader of Britain's opposition labour Party, recently criticized Reagan's involvement in Central America and charged him with heightening Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span>But despite certain dissatisfactions with Reagan's foreign policy, the Western nations seem to discount the potential significance of the upcoming election-as if Reagan's reelection were assured.  This view comes in part from an admiration of Reagan's apparent strength, although they may disagree with his ends.</span></p> <p><span>There is a sense, Vernon says,\" of them [the Europeans] feeling tied to our chariots, without any say in which direction the horse is going.  Of course they see Reagan as a certainty, in this situation, but they've been very wrong in the past about American elections.  I think there's some naivete on their parts about how the electoral system works here.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the Middle East, controversy over the West Bank settlement and the role of the United States in that region has most of the leaders in that region paying similarly close attention to the election.  So far, Jackson has distinguished himself from the other Democratic candidates.  \"because he's broken out of the normal pattern of Presidential candidates of being unthinkingly pro-Israel,\" Lecturer Daniel Pipes, a Middle East History specialist, says Glenn has also been more consistent in not taking a pro-Israel stance, Pipes adds, and therefore runs a close second to Jackson in pro-Arab states.</span></p> <p><span>Most Israelis would be happy with Reagan for another four years, or Mondale, who has been consistently pro-Israel in the past.</span></p> <p><span>To the south, Reagan's policies have increased the stake of many Latin and Central American countries in the upcoming U.S. election.</span></p> <p><span>Within each country,\" conservative or the more reactionary elements would be very happy if Reagan were re-elected, but everyone else would be unhappy, because it would mean four more years of trouble,\" Woods Professor of latin American History John Womack says,\" I mean, in terms of economic, political, and military foreign policy, Reagan would mean very substantial problems for peace and little chance. for better life in their country.\"</span></p> <p><span>A major concern for these countries is the size of the Reagan defense budget and its effect on the Latin American economy.  According to Womack, a Democratic President would make it easier for Latin American countries to borrow money.  \"With a lower defense budget, there would be a decline in the real rate of interest, and a higher possibility for exporting into the U.S.  The ability of Latin American countries to export products has decreased a lot in the last four years.\"</span></p> <p><span>Like other regions of the globe, Latin American leaders are keenly interested in the election--\"some probably follow the race more closely than we do,\" Womack says, adding that most think Reagan will be reelected.</span></p> <p><span>In Africa, particularly Black African countries, one issue predominates the discussion of U.S. Presidential candidates:  South Africa.  To this end, Africans tend to favor Democratic candidates, recalling the more vigorous human rights policies of Democratic former President Jimmy Carter.</span></p> <p><span>\"Right now there's a sense that any candidate would be preferable to Reagan,\" John W. Thomas, lecturer in Public Policy at the Kennedy School of Government, says.  Although most of the Democratic candidates seem indistinguishable, \"They [Africans] are intrigued by [the Rev.] Jesse L. Jackson, and ask me whether he has a chance,\" Thomas says.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is a sense throughout Africa that as long as the U.S. can keep supporting the white regime in South Africa, it cannot be pro-Africa,\" Thomas says.  There is also some misunderstanding on the part of Africans:  \"They cannot understand why Reagan is so popular, or why American foreign policy is so Soviet Union-directed, and it's hard for me to explain.\"</span></p> <p><span>A major Reagan campaign pledge in 1980 was his firm commitment to Taiwan, but the President has modified that stance over the past three years.  The resulting policy has created ambivalence toward Reagan in Taiwan and mainland China alike.</span></p> <p><span>Anxious to cement its ties with other Third World nations, leaders of Communist China have become more openly critical of the United States, though generally not of Reagan himself, Williams Professor of History and Political Science Benjamin I. Schwartz says.  Attitudes of the Taiwan government has been similarly critical, but have fluctuated with declining expectations of the President as he toned down his commitment to arms sales for that country.  Schwartz says, \"It's still a bit premature, but as elections approach, you'll probably see a move away from Reagan.\"</span></p> <p><span>Waiting, then, seems to be the game for both foreign governments and American diplomats concerned with the impact of the upcoming election</span></p>"}

{"title": "Black Poverty | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Thirty years after the Supreme Court ruled against public school segregation in the case of <i>Brown V. Board of Education</i> and 20 years after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 formally outlawed segregation and discrimination throughout the land, the social cancer we call poverty has tightened its grip on a large and growing number of Black Americans.  Unless we as a nation make a sharp break with the inadequate policies of the past--both Democratic and Republican alike--a very large number of Blacks will remain locked outside the mainstream of American society.</span></p> <p><span>Not all Blacks have suffered in recent years, some clearly experienced social mobility.  Between 1967 and 1977 the number of Black families with incomes greater than $25,000 (in constant 1977 dollars) increased by twofold.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, the condition of many Blacks did not improve during this period.  The Reagan Administration has virtually ignored the problem; indeed its retreat on civil rights enforcement and its budget cuts have exacerbated it.  Yet even if a sympathetic Democrat such as Walter Mondale were to win office in 1984, the outlook for the Black poor still appears quite bleak.  For the reinstatement of the traditional civil rights policies will probably not affect a large number of Blacks who will most likely remain below the poverty line, locked outside the mainstream of American society.</span></p> <p><span>According to the Bureau of the Census in 1984 some 34 percent of all Black Americans lived below the poverty line a rate almost three and a half times that of whites.  More ominously the number of poor Blacks appears to be increasing in 1981 fully 45 percent of all Black children under age 18 were living below the poverty line Black leaders and intellectuals typically blame the continued existence of racial discrimination for the high rate of Black poverty.  Yet given the fact that poverty appears to be on the increase in recent years, racism as a causal explanation simply fails Certainly racism did not increase so drastically over the past decade such that the Black unemployment rate would rise from 10.3 percent in 1972 to 18.9 percent in 1982 or such that the Black teenage unemployment rate would rise from about 28 percent in 1972 to 48 percent in 1982.</span></p> <p><span>Recently another interpretation has gained currency which sees the horrible conditions of impoverished Blacks as largely the result of the maladaptive, chaotic, cultural patterns of low-income Blacks.  This view holds that the high Black poverty rate persists because lower-income Blacks exhibit a set of attitudes and norms which prevent them from escaping poverty.  Proponents of this view single out one phenomenon in particular as evidence of the self-perpetuating nature of Black poverty; unwed pregnancy.  Indeed in 1981 fully 55 percent of all Black children were born out of wedlock, up from 24 percent in 1962 and 38 percent in 1970.</span></p> <p><span>However, before accepting the cultural view we must first ask what precipitated this decline in familial norms and attitudes among the Black poor.  And here we see that the \"cultural\" interpretation fails much like the one of \"racism.\"  In the last 30 years there have been many developments such as demographic shifts and changes in the economy which have had a profound impact on the lives of a large number of Black Americans.  Contrary to the notion that the attitudes and behaviors of lower-income Blacks are internal and largely unrelated to external influences such as the economy.  It is these developments which explain the insistence of such a high rate of poverty among Blacks.</span></p> <p><span>As recently as 1940, 41 percent of all Blacks lived on farms Largely because of the mechanization of agriculture, however, millions of Black tenant farmers found themselves displaced from their already precarious positions.  Some went to Southern cities, a large number of them migrated to the North.  By 1970 then the number of Blacks on farms had declined to less than 5 percent Under ordinary circumstances we could expect such a massive social dislocation to have an adverse impact on Black family stability, we could also expect that it would take some time for Blacks to become adjusted to urban life just as it took time for white immigrant groups to make the adjustment.  But unfortunately, Blacks encountered even more difficulty than normally expected not just because of racism, but also because of resent changes in the job market which reduced the demand for unskilled labor, removing that crucial rung which white immigrant groups used to escape poverty much earlier in American history.</span></p> <p><span>So when Blacks arrived <i>en masse</i> in the nation's central cities these cities were in deep economic decline and had few opportunities open for their new citizens.  Examples abound.  Between 1948 and 1977 Chicago lost over 450,000 jobs in the manufacturing, wholesale and retail sectors but gained only about 50,000 jobs in the service sector.  Since 1948, New York City lost 600,000 jobs  in the same sectors-including about 450,000 jobs since 1967-while the offsetting gains in New York amounted to only 30,000 jobs in the service sector since 1967.  The story is much the same in other cities with large concentrations of Blacks such as Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore, Cleveland, Gary, and Newark.  When we consider the toll exacted by the persistence of high unemployment (and underemployment) and the tragic fact that many Blacks, frustrated by failure, have simply stopped looking for work, the \"cultural argument that Black family instability and unwed pregnancy are unrelated to external factors seems quite absurd indeed.</span></p> <p><span>The solution to this human tragedy of unemployment lies simply in employment.  There must be a dramatic increase in the number of jobs available for low-skilled Black workers.  Because of the inability of the private sector to generate enough jobs, the only remaining alternative is for a massive federal jobs program.  Unlike previous job programs, this one would not be a temporary program of make-work but rather part of a major effort to improve urban transportation expand the supply of low-and moderate-income housing and to rebuild the national infrastructure of bridges, reservoirs, roads, and highways.</span></p> <p><span>Many will argue against the necessity of such a direct federal effort and instead will advocate massive investment in education and job training programs so that lower-income Blacks can obtain the skills necessary to acquire decent jobs.  (This in fact, was the approach of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.)  However, that proposal has a number of fundamental flaws.  First of all, even if such an education and retraining effort succeeded, there is very little evidence to suggest that there are enough jobs available to employ most of the new workers.  As I noted before, the number of new jobs opening in the service sector in the central cities is dwarfed by the number of jobs which have left the cities.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, the view which assumes that education can play a major role in helping groups to escape poverty fundamentally misinterprets American social history.  In fact, no immigrant group--not even those known for educational attainment like the Chinese, the Japanese, and the Jews--escaped poverty through education Rather these groups first moved from poverty to the upper working-class.  Then they used education to hasten their entry to the middle and upper middle classes.</span></p> <p><span>I am under no illusions about the popularity it the likely enactment of the policies advocated here, but neither am I under any illusions about the plight of the Black poor.  To those who say that there will be no massive federal jobs program.  I simply answer that in the absence of such a program, there will be no improvement in the horrible conditions which the Black poor suffer, period.</span></p> <p><span>The civil rights legislation of the 1960s opened up new opportunities for many Blacks; during the 1970's the ranks of the Black middle class expanded greatly Our nation must now go beyond limited policies like affirmative action to institute the requisite economic reforms to assist impoverished Blacks.  If the present trend continues, perhaps one half of the Black community will soon be poor.  No development could be more tragic for these Blacks; no development could be more tragic for America.</span></p> <p><span><i>Robert A.

A half hour before the nine O'clock flight was to leave for London an agitated elderly woman hurried up to the counter.  \"I'm sorry, this station's, station's closed, you'll have to go wait in that line, said the agent.</span></p> <p><span>But the flight leaves in half an hour and I've lost my ticket.\"</span></p> <p><span>I'm sorry I can't help you, you've got to go stand in the line marked passengers without tickets.\"  The agent turned her back on the woman and started gathering her things for the trip home it was quitting time.</span></p> <p><span>Starting to panic, the woman hurried down the counter to where five people waiting for tickets were looking at their watches.  There was only one agent selling tickets and each customer was taking about five minutes.  It was going to be tough for all of them to make the flight.  Now visibly upset, the woman spilled out her story.  She had gotten her ticket with plenty of time to spare and gone up to the departure area where there had been some confusion, and a lot of people milling about.  She had been holding her ticket inside her passport, but when she got to the gate it was gone.  Quickly she retraced her steps looking for the missing piece of paper but it had vanished.</span></p> <p><span>The businessman charging a ticket fidgeted and the ticket agent glared while the woman tumbled forth her story in a high British accent.  \"You'll have to go to the end of the line, there are people waiting.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"But I already waited in the line, and the plane leaves in just a few minutes, all I need you to do is reissue my ticket.</span></p> <p><span>I'm sorry lady, I can't do that.  Will you get to the end of the line please.\"</span></p> <p><span>At this point, the woman started to cry and mutter under her breath.  \"I don't understand why they won't help me, I know I should have put it in my purse I've got to get home, what am I going to do.  The people around her were starting to get uncomfortable but crying burned off some of the tension and as her fear and confusion subsided her anger rose.  \"I'm never flying this damn airline again,\" she said drying her face.  Would you people mind terribly if I went ahead of you, I'm sure I'll only be a minute.\"</span></p> <p><span>By this time shoe caps and acoustic tiling were getting very interesting and no one standing in line gave much more than a shrug.</span></p> <p><span>As she approached the counter, the ticket agent glowered at the people in line for allowing another complainant in their midst.  After hearing the request for a ticket reissue, the agent said.  \"I can't do that, you'll have to talk to a supervisor.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Well get me the supervisor, hurry up there are people waiting in line and the plane leaves in about 20 minutes.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Your name is on the computer as having a reservation, but our records show that the ticket has already been picked up.  Unless it gets turned in it is still a valid ticket so you will have to buy another one if you want to go,\" the supervisor said.</span></p> <p><span>\"I can't do that I don't have the money, you have my name right there.  You know I was supposed to be on the plane.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm sorry but all that means is that you bought a ticket, anybody could use it.  Just because you bought a ticket doesn't mean you are entitled to get on the plane.  You have to buy another ticket.  It's company policy.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>OMPANY POLICY Two words that cause more frustration and anger in day-to-day business than perhaps any others.  Company policy aggravates the public which sometimes needs a little understanding, and it stifles creative employees who might want to use some initiative and take some responsibility.  Now it could be that Helen Hayes as the stowaway in <i>Airport</i> gave old ladies such a bad name that they are immediately suspect upon entering the terminal, but it seems so much more likely that the woman had actually dropped her ticket.  If the ticket agents or even the supervisors were given a little more room to exercise their own judgement the incident could have been handled smoothly.  She wouldn't have had to miss her flight, the last one of the night, while the supervisor was on the phone doing everything short of asking for an F.B.I. background check before deciding whether they could issue her another ticket.</span></p> <p><span>This institutionalized buck passing and shoulder shrugging is crippling and leads to sloppy work and decreased productivity in business and the government.  A recent series of television commercials showed workers in Detroit plants welding, riveting and painting.  They were identified by name and allowed to speak about their work.  It is an effective technique.  It tells the worker that the company has confidence in him and is proud to let him represent the product he makes.  Nothing is worse for morale than the feeling that your job is so rigid and standardized that you are eminently replaceable.  If the commercials, had instead shown Lee lacocca standing in front of a Chrysler saying.  \"The buck stops with me, if this car isn't built right, I'm personally responsible,\" Chrysler workers would have greeted it with beer bottles the first time it interrupted a football game.  The fact is, lacocca isn't responsible for building the cars right.  He's responsible for making sure he has good people and equipment; the men and women on the line decide how well to put the cars together.  Perhaps the worst example of multi-layered management and institutionalized indifference is the civil service.  Everyone can remember infuriating days at the Department of Motor Vehicles or Land Records Office.  With no responsibility, almost complete job security, and little chance for significant promotion, it is no wonder so many civil servants care little when someone walks into the office.</span></p> <p><span>An interesting, although somewhat inverted, example of governmental buck passing occured last fall when President Reagan took personal responsibility for the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut and thus saved any individual officers from disciplinary action.  The move was politically correct, but wrong.  The officers who based troops in a poorly guarded, multi-story building in the middle of a war should have been hauled out in their underwear.  Of course it is difficult to protect troops from determined terrorism--suicide attacks in particular--but that's their job:  they made a mistake and should be held accountable.</span></p> <p><span>Obviously the federal government and T.W.A. are a little too large to be run like family businesses, but it would be good for both the public and its employees if they could be run with some compassion.  It is their institutional intractability which makes them so frustrating, especially on a rainy day when the planes are delayed.</span></p>"}

Glenn echoed one of Hart's criticisms of Mondale, saying, the politics of the past were proven to be exactly that the politics of the past.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I am not considering dropping out,\" Glenn said, surrounded by his campaign brass.  \"I'm going to the convention in San Francisco and I'm going to be the nominee.\"</span></p> <p><span>Glenn staffers last night said the senator will concentrate on winning delegates in southern states, especially Alabama, where the former astronaut has a strong organization.</span></p> <p><span>New Hampshire Campaign Director Paul Shone said Glenn is still a factor in the race for the Democratic nomination because of his national reputation.</span></p> <p><span>Hart's triumph must be ranked among the most stunning upsets in primary history.

Moreover, Hart does not have full delegate slates in a number of states.</span></p> <p><span>Gary R.

{"title": "A Change of Hart? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE NEW IDEA may very well be the oldest idea in politics.</span></p> <p><span>In 1946, John F. Kennedy '40's slogan in his first Congressional race was, \"A new generation of leadership.\"</span></p> <p><span>In 1960, John Kennedy said on the Presidential campaign trail in Warm Springs, Ga., \"A new generation of Americans has assumed leadership--a new generation of Americans that is not satisfied to be second best.\"</span></p> <p><span>In Wisconsin the following week:  \"I think we must move.  I think we must push the United States ahead again.  I think we must give this country new leadership.  I think America must move forward again.\"</span></p> <p><span>In Washington, D.C.:  \"This is a critical hour in our nation's history.\"</span></p> <p><span>In Akron, Ohio:  \"This contest is between those who say, 'You never had it so good,' and those who say, 'This country can do better.'\"</span></p> <p><span>And in various places, on too many dates to mention, Kennedy called for \"new ideas and new leadership.\"</span></p> <p><span>In a debate among the Democratic Presidential candidates in Des Moines, Iowa this year, Sen. Gary W. Hart (D-Colo) said:  \"We used to have Democratic Presidents who asked us what we could do for our country,...who challenged us to express our idealism....  I think this country can do better...We are at a critical time in this nation's history.  This is an election about our future versus our past...I am running and I need your help to move this country into the future.  I ask you to help me move this country forward.\"</span></p> <p><span>And at a debate in Hanover, N.H.--as well as at campaign stops all over the country--Hart called for \"new ideas and new leadership...a new generation of leadership...[for] a new generation of Americans.\"</span></p> <p><span>In 1960, John Kennedy was lucky.  His New Idea rhetoric carried him past older and poorer rivals for the Democratic nomination, and then just barely past Vice-President Richard Nixon for the Presidency.  Twenty-four years later, though, Gary Hart won't be so lucky if he depends upon New Idea rhetoric alone to win the Democratic nomination, and then the Presidency.  In the rosiest of scenarios, Hart might overwhelm Walter F. Mondale simply by convincing voters that the former Vice President is a figure from the discredited past.  He would then go on to win the nomination, and, course uncorrected, lose the general election.</span></p> <p><span>For Ronald Reagan--who will defend a record of his own making--is not Vice-President Richard Nixon.  And Gary Hart--who has not yet demonstrated any great personal charisma--is not Senator John Kennedy.  More important, Ronald Reagan offers a clear--albeit atavistic--vision of what he would like America to be Reagan is dead set on dismantling government--or at least the kind Americans have known for the past forty years.  His American future is a blurry dream of what this country never was in the nineteenth century.</span></p> <p><span>He has opposed progressive taxation an un-American.  He has opposed government regulation as intrusive.  He has opposed every arms-control agreement to date.</span></p> <p><span>He believes children should pray in public schools.  He believes women should be denied the right to terminate their pregnancy.  He believes that military superiority should be our goal.  Ronald Reagan's vision of the future is a cross between Pollyanna and Darwin.</span></p> <p><span>In the Democratic Party, Walter Mondale offers no new vision, and for that reason, more than any other, the American voter will not choose him in 1984.  Mondale is in favor of the Democratic innovations of the past forty years, and so are most Americans.  Mondale is against the Reagan regression of the past four years, and so are many Americans.</span></p> <p><span>Well, that would seem enough:  be for something a lot of people are for, and be against something a lot of people are against.  But, unfortunately, there's a third requirement:  one need explain in clear and inspiring terms just where we should go from here.  And it is on this count that Walter Mondale fails and Gary Hart must succeed if he is to continue to establish himself as the alternative to Mondale.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>O WIN the Democratic nomination and then the Presidency, Gary Hart must infuse his Kenedyesqsue rhetoric with Rooseveltian innovation.  He must stop talking about a \"new generation of leadership,\" and start explaining what bold, new, creative solutions he can offer.  As Ronald Reagan is the philosophical descendant of Barry Goldwater, Gary Hart can be the heir of Camelot.  Hart has cast himself as a progressive liberal; now he must offer--as Goldwater called it in 1964--\"a choice, and not an echo.\"</span></p> <p><span>So far, it seems, Hart has unveiled only one new idea, along with some vague new themes.  His Individual Training Account--to be contributed to by both employer and employee--would be used to retrain workers in traditional and declining industries.  It's a good idea, but it should be one of many, not the only one.  Military reform and industrial policy are two themes Hart has often mentioned, but rarely explained.  And neither is straightforward enough to evoke passion--much less interest.</span></p> <p><span>Hart should announce a comprehensive plan of action to revive the economy.  Why not set up a venture-capital agency to help start-up companies?  Assemble twenty top corporate leaders to assess industrial prospects, and then let them choose high-growth sectors to invest in.  Japan and West Germany have set up such programs with success.</span></p> <p><span>On the international trade front, declare that the United States will match all its trading partners' import restrictions.  We might be surprised how quickly their barriers go down if there's a threat that ours will go up.</span></p> <p><span>Hart talks about \"restoring compassion to our government...[and] providing new help to the people who most need the assistance of this nation....\"  Why not set a minimum level of income for all Americans and couple it with the so-called negative income tax?  This tax would guarantee a minimum income without eliminating the incentive to become self-supporting.  The plan has supporters on both sides of the political spectrum, including former Senator George S. McGovern and Nobel laureate Milton Friedman.</span></p> <p><span>Nearly 70 percent of families below the poverty line are led by single women-Establish a national system of day-care centers to educate and feed poor children.  Limited programs of this--Head Start is one--have been overwhelming successes.</span></p> <p><span>Even the most prudent middle-class family can be devastated by unforseen medical bills.  Every American should have access to immediate, safe, and affordable medical care.  Hart should propose a program of national healthcare insurance.</span></p> <p><span>Progress has been slow with environmental protection Try a different approach Virtually all professional economists favor taxing polluters per unit of discharge.  Such a plan could save bilions of dollars, and, more important, provide unavoidable incentives not to pollute.</span></p> <p><span>Hart talks about \"restoring the fire of idealism\" to public service.  He should call for a program of national non-military service.  In a kind of national Peace Corps, volunteers would help the poor and the homeless and the elderly all over the country.  In return for their service, they would receive educational grants, thus ensuring that all Americans have the opportunity to go to college.</span></p> <p><span>Hart correctly identifies that enemy south of the border as \"hunger, poverty, and disease--not Communism.\"  Why not propose a new Marshall Plan, but this time for South and Central America?  We helped Western Europe after World War II not out of charity, but because we knew that a strong and independent Europe was essential to our economy and our security.  So to with the Americas:  help them develop into self-sufficient trading partners and allies, not industrial colonies.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HESE ARE new ideas in the progressive tradition:  bold, creative, and experimental.  But the path of progressive leadership through this century is still unfinished.  It no doubt began with the New Freedom of Wood row Wilson, continued through Franklin D. Roosevelt '04's New Deal, and then the New Frontier of John Kennedy.</span></p> <p><span>The election of 1984 may very well decide the future of progressive liberalism--and this country.  Were the national vicissitudes of Vietnam, Watergate, and Ronald Reagan merely twists in the path?  Or have we taken a different path altogether?  To win the Presidency this year Gary Hart must craft a new vision; from his new rhetoric.</span></p>"}

Richardson '41 as eager to like taxes.</span></p> <p><span>In a televised debate last week at Faneuil Hall, Shamie, a lively and aggressive speaker, continued to identify ideologically with president Reagan, whom he quoted as being opposed to say new taxes to reduce the deficit.</span></p> <p><span>Richard son whipped out a clip of his own, quaking Reagan's speech from the previous day in which the President acknowledged that taxes would have to be increased if needed at a last resort.</span></p> <p><span>\"He never made an ironclad guarantee of no new taxes.\"  Richardson told a statewide audience in the hour-long debate.  \"The arithmetic may force us to raise taxes.\"</span></p> <p><span>His explanations to the contrary, front runner Richardson has been placed on the defensive on the tax issue, despite repeated assertions that he only favors new taxes or budget cuts and economic growth do not result in substantial new revenues.</span></p> <p><span>\"Elliot, you're always argued for taxes,\" said Shamie, who argues that '12, percent growth rate over the next two years will wipe out the estimated $200 billion deficit.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview after the debate, Share continued to hammer Richardson for wanting to raise taxes.  \"Elliot was trying to establish that the President secretly harbors a plan to raise taxes,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Richardson, for his part, argued after after the debate that Shamie has misrepresented the Administration's stance on taxes.  \"The President couldn't have timed his speech better,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>The former attorney general has maintained that Sharnie's belief in moderate growth as a means to eliminate the deficit (a belief held by the conservative wing of the party) is unreasonable, saying that only massive, prolonged growth could impact the deficit.</span></p> <p><span>Shemie, who supports a balanced budget amendment, ran into trouble of his own on the tax issues last week, when he said on a radio talk show that he is unfamiliar with major 1983 legislation that raised Social Security taxes to bail out the ailing program.</span></p> <p><span>He also had difficulty explaining why he agrees with suppy-side economist Milton Friedman--who says there is no correlates between interest rates and tans--and still believes that is \"historical fact\" that the deficit decreases by $20 billion for each percentage point drop in interest rates.</span></p> <p><span>Shaims clarified his stance in an interview, saying that interest rates and deficits are only related in the long term, and that yearly fluctuations in lending rates do not directly affect the deficit.</span></p> <p><span>The debate over taxes has been symptomatic of this entire camping, which has become a contest between members of opposite wings of the Republican part.  Richardson, an old-line Brahmin who has held doses of cabinet posts, including Secretary of Defense, has advocated a more liberal approach to social and foreign policy issue, supporting ERA, abortion rights, busing, and the nuclear freeze, and opposing U.S. military involvement in Central America.</span></p> <p><span>Shamie, a businessman and inventor who has never served in government before, is a should-mate of the populist-conservatives who hold away in party platform formulation last month at the Dellas convention.  Shemie palled nearly 40 percent of the vote two years ago when he ran against Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54 (D-Maas.), pushing a similar economic and foreign policy agenda.</span></p> <p><span>\"You can tell alot about the candidates from what they say about taxes,\" Shamie side Charles Meaning said yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>Messing added that Shamie is pushing taxes because it best illustrates what the campaign would like to show as basic philosophical differences between the candidates.  Painting Richardson as supporting tax like \"place on him the Washington mantle as a man supporting bigger government,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Richardson press secretary David Gilroy Countered yesterday that Shamie has tried to focus on the tax issue to detract attention from Richardson's proposals for a nuclear freeze, conflict prevention, and environmental issues.  But he added, \"Taxes are obviously a very emotional issue.\"</span></p> <p><span>The two candidates will again debate before a television salience tonight at Faneuil Hall.  The 8 p.m. debate will be carried live by WNEY-TV, Channel 7, and WEEI radio.</span></p>"}
{"title": "While You Were Out | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>President Bok evidently wasn't too worried about the shop this summer--he took off for a two-month \"working\" vacation in Italy.</span></p> <p><span>Nor was John B. Fox Jr. '59, dean of the College--he found time to take a few weeks in England with his family.  And Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III went to England too, as he normally does each summer, so the country city of Bath.</span></p> <p><span>Still, the place didn't shut down entirely.  Harvard won a long-standing dispute with another college over a major federal research grant.  A number of academic departments gained new tenured professors.  And throughout the University, numerous scientists made headlines for new discoveries.</span></p> <p><span><b>Ed School Grant</b></span></p> <p><span>Harvard officials breathed a sigh of relief when the government upheld a $7 million grant to the Graduate School of Education for a school-technology center.</span></p> <p><span>The ruling by the General Accounting Office (GAO) marked an important step in resolving year-old charges that the National Institute of Education (NIE) played favorites by awarding the money to Harvard over Bank St. College of New York.</span></p> <p><span>Bank St. had argued that the award was improper because the NIE director, Manuel J. Justiz, had ignored the advice of a technical review panel that the New York college get the money instead.  The panel gave Bank St. slightly higher marks for technical merit and economy, but Justiz was understood to have chosen Harvard because of the larger scope of its proposal and its greater resources.</span></p> <p><span>Bank St. was also angry over charges that another NIE official had given Harvard and MIT, which was also bidding for the grant, an unfair advantage by informing the schools that their bids were $2 million over the agency's estimate for the project.</span></p> <p><span>Both Harvard and MIT subsequently lowered their bids to near NIE's $7.7 million figure while Bank St. remained unaware that it had underbid dramatically with its $4.5 million proposal.</span></p> <p><span>In squashing Bank St.'s complaints, the GAO ruled that the regulations governing the competition were matters of internal policy guidance--not law--and hence not grounds for disallowing the contract.  Bank St. has vowed to appeal, but time rolls on and Harvard's new center will soon move into its second year of operation.</span></p> <p><span><b>Discoveries</b></span></p> <p><span>Students leave Cambridge in June, but most professors do not, especially scientists, whose lab experiments do not run by the academic calendar.  The past summer saw a number of Harvard scientists step into the limelight with the announcement of a new finding or discovery.</span></p> <p><span>For Carlo Rubbia, public attention is becoming old hat.  Rubbia, professor of Physics, smashes atoms--a particularly fruitful line of work of late--and he has been doing ground-breaking experimentation that scientists hope will confirm much recent theoretical thinking about the forces of nature.</span></p> <p><span>This summer Rubbia found the sixth quark, one of the most sought-after discoveries in modern physics.  Quarks are thought to be the basic building blocks of all larger atomic particles.  Scientists have long predicted the existence of six quarks; five were known, and Rubbia's finding completed the roster.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard scientists also announced progress in another hot area of scientific research--the battle to fight Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).  A number of researchers at the School of Public Health have been at the forefront of the fight against this often deadly killer, which has disproportionately affected gay men.</span></p> <p><span>This summer a team led by Associate Professor of Microbiology William A. Haseltine announced that it may have found a gene that is responsible for the disease, as well as certain kinds of cancer.</span></p> <p><span>Haseltine and his associates figured out how a leukemia virus--known as HTLV-I--takes control and infects blood cells.  They believe that a similar process is at work when HTLV-3 viruses--which is believed to be the cause of AIDS--attack cells.  And they think that some genetic material in this family of viruses is the culprit.</span></p> <p><span>But perhaps the most widely publicized scientific event of the summer was not a discovery but a saving.  Harvard doctors used a new method of growing sheets of skin from tiny samples to save the lives of two young brothers, who suffered burns over almost all of their bodies in a freak accident.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. Howard Green, chairman of the Physiology Department at the Medical School, has pioneered a method of growing a one-inch square sample of skin and in three of four weeks cultivating enough new skin to cover an entire body.</span></p> <p><span>The method proved a lifesaver to brothers Jamie and Glen Selby of Caspar, Wyo., who were burned after they playfully painted their bodies, tried to remove the paint with a solvent, and then came into contact with a flame.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. G. Gregory Gallico a plastic surgeon at the Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital, used skin grown in Green's laboratories to cover the burned bodies, gaining press attention from across the country.</span></p> <p><span><b>Academic Departments</b></span></p> <p><span>One of Harvard's smallest departments, the Celtic Department, completed a major turnover in personnel by hiring a specialist in Irish literature from University College Cork, Ireland.</span></p> <p><span>Sean O'Coileain, a native speaker of Irish, will become the chairman of the only university department in the country devoted solely to Celtic languages and literatures.</span></p> <p><span>The department's previous chairman, Robinson Professor of Celtic Languages and Literature Charles W. Dunn, retired in June.  Another full professor, John V. Kellecher, has moved to part-time duties.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, the Department of Germanic Literatures and Languages broke a long hiring drought by tenuring a Smith College expert in modern German literature.</span></p> <p><span>The appointment of Judith Ryan came after the department had received several turndowns of offers, as well as getting mired in some internal division over what kind of appointments to make.  Ryan becomes the Faculty's 22nd woman tenured professor.</span></p> <p><span>A Cornell German specialist, Sander L. Gilman, is still mulling over a University offer.</span></p> <p><span>The Government Department was also a beehive of activity.</span></p> <p><span>The biggest news was the announcement of an unusual tenure agreement concerning one of Harvard's most famous scholars, Shattuck Professor of Government James Q. Wilson.</span></p> <p><span>Wilson was granted a tenured position at the University of California at Los Angeles.  In what officials termed an unprecedented move, Harvard allowed Wilson to keep his Harvard chair for the next three years, during which he will divide his time between the two schools.</span></p> <p><span>Wilson, a native Californian and one of the country's foremost experts on crime and bureaucracy, said that at the end of the three years he will choose between the two.</span></p> <p><span>Until then he will keep himself busy working on, among other things, on a 26-episode TV series--to be aired on public stations--on crime and criminal behavior.</span></p> <p><span>Department members also announced the revamping of their graduate studies program in what they called the department's biggest reform in 30 years.</span></p> <p><span>Professors said the restructuring and tightening of the requirements for government graduate students grew out of the feeling that the current program was too specialized.  They hope the changes will help the grads where it counts in finding jobs in the ever-tough academic market.</span></p> <p><span><b>Divinity School</b></span></p> <p><span>Little short of a revelation will startle the quiet scholars who inhabit Andover Hall, but this summer came pretty close.  The Harvard Divinity School is in the midst of an unprecedented turnover in Faculty, and now is looking for seven full-time professors.</span></p> <p><span>The biggest loss was that of Mellon Professor of Divinity Krister Stendahl, who announced plans to leave Harvard this September to become the Bishop of Stockholm in the Church of Sweden.  Stendahl, who came to Harvard from Sweden 30 years ago, is one of the world's foremost authorities on The New Testament, and he served as dean of the school from 1968 to 1979.</span></p> <p><span>Along with his departure, resignations and the coincidental ending of three associate professors terms put the school in the market for six more professors.  Two of the openings are at the tenured level, and three are at the junior level.  Two others, in Christian historical theology and archeology, have optional ranks, and the school is reviewing candidates at all levels.</span></p> <p><span>Significantly, among the new openings is the school's first position--a junior-level job--in Afro-American Religion.  The next tenured professor at the school will also be the first such new appointment in seven or eight years, administrators say.  There are 40 faculty members at the Div School, including 15 part-time professors.</span></p> <p><span><b>Controversy</b></span></p> <p><span>Robert M. Coles '50, professor of Psychiatry and Medical Humanities, is no stranger to conflict, but he may have waded into the hottest controversy of his career--children and nuclear war.  For several years now, a group of doctors and psychiatrists, many of them Harvard-affiliated, has put forth the idea that the threat of nuclear war poses a unique psychological danger to children--an idea with which Coles now takes issue.</span></p> <p><span>In a widely publicized speech in Los Alamos, N.M., Coles presented recent research findings in which he attacks as methodologically flawed studies that conclude that the threat of nuclear war has terrorized children.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, says the celebrated child psychiatrist, interviews he conducted around the country indicate that children--especially those from working-class families--have reacted to the nuclear age with far less fear than psychiatric research has indicated.</span></p> <p><span>On other fronts, Harvard professors busily stirred up controversy.  Professor of Law Alan M. Dershowitz began a one-man campaign to get the University to award honorary degrees to Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharoy, his wife Yelena Bonner, and other political prisoners and dissidents.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately for Dershowitz's proposal.  Harvard has a policy of not conferring honorary degrees on people who can't show up in Cambridge personally to receive the honor--a fact cited by President Bok in a letter responding to the professor's request.</span></p> <p><span>But Dershowitz has not given up hope. \"Bok's attitude is a thing of the past,\" he says.  Expressing hope for a mass movement of students and faculty, he says.  \"Bok doesn't seriously consider things unless he feels that not to do something would create more hassle than to do something.\"</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, yet another outspoken faculty member, Professor of Biology Ruth Hubbard '45, is continuing her crusade to win the right to travel to Cuba.</span></p> <p><span>But that effort was dealt a serious setback when the Supreme Court upheld the Reagan Administration's restrictions on personal travel to the country Hubbard and two other women sued President Reagan in 1982 after the government prevented them from going on a fact-finding tour of Cuba.  Hubbard says the group will try to get the High Court to overturn its decision.</span></p> <p><span><b>B-School Subcontracting</b></span></p> <p><span>When the union that represents Harvard's Food Service workers signed a contract with the University last summer--after a one-day flash strike--one of the provisions they won was an agreement that Harvard not subcontract any of its work out to outside firms if any union employees are laid off or take a cut in hours.</span></p> <p><span>That provision was tested this summer when the Business School decided to hire the Marriott Corporation, a national food chain, to manage its dining halls.  Officials called it an effort to bring the school's facilities up to restaurant standards.</span></p> <p><span>But officials with the union, Local 26 of the Hotel, Restaurant, Institutional Employees and Bartenders Union, expressed fear that the switch may eventually enable Harvard to replace its workers with non-union employees.</span></p> <p><span>For now there will be no change for the Food Service workers at the B-School, who will work for Marriott under the same contract they signed with Harvard.  But Marriott has made no commitment for after the contract expires in 1986, and union officials say it will be a difficult struggle to negotiate a similar pact at that point.</span></p> <p><span><b>In Transition</b></span></p> <p><span>Harvard administrators have big plans to computerize the campus, and a man who will who have a lot of input into the project logged on this summer.</span></p> <p><span>The University tapped Steven C. Hall, a 20-year veteran of the computer industry, to head its Office of Information Technology.  As chief of the office that oversees Harvard's sprawling computer services, Hall is expected to play a major role in helping Harvard set up a network connecting computers around campus.</span></p> <p><span>Those leaving Cambridge, on the other hand, will probably include Bromley Professor of Law Paul M. Bator.  After spending the last 18 months as Deputy Solicitor General in the Justice Department, Bator was tapped by President Reagan for a federal appellate court judgeship.</span></p> <p><span>If Congress approves the nomination as expected, Bator will resign his professorship this fall.</span></p> <p><span>And Professor of Chinese and Central Asian History Joseph F. Fletcher '57, one of the world's leading specialists on inner Asia, died after a long battle with cancer.</span></p> <p><span>Fletcher, who fought to continue teaching despite his illness, was known as an excellent instructor, and won the Leven son Teaching Prize from undergraduates in 1983.  In January 1983, after an extended stay in the hospital, Fletcher returned to his class, Historical Study B-14, \"Empire of the Mongols.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"One thing that happens when you face death, as I did and do, is you discover what your priorities are.  It's important to have fun--lots of us forget that,\" he told his students at the time.  \"In facing my priorities,\" he said, \"I realized I love teaching this course.\"</span></p>"}

I regret to inform you of a most serious intelligence lapse.</span></p> <p><span><b>Konstantin U. Chernenko:</b>  What?  Did Dobrynin finally defect?</span></p> <p><span><b>Chebrikov:</b>  No, something much more serious.  Comrade General One of our top secret moles may now be compromised.</span></p> <p><span><b>Chernenko:</b>  Who is it?  The man they call Mr. D?</span></p> <p><span><b>Chebrikov:</b>  You mean Mr. T. sir Not him, luckily for us.  But this is almost as bad.  The chief of our east coast disinformation campaign.  William F. Buckley has gone off, as they say in America, \"the deep end.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Chernenko:</b>  No, not Buckley!!!  He was one of our best.</span></p> <p><span><b>Chebrikov:</b>  Yes, sir the Krem de la Krem.  It was he who helped whip up the anti-Soviet paranoia in 1980 to help the election of our friend, Ronald Reagan.  It was he who helped fan the fires of extreme anti-communism over the '60s and '70s while the doves in the Democratic Party went soft on our efforts.  Were it not for him, and his friends like George Will, we might now have to be talking to the Americans.</span></p> <p><span><b>Chernenko:</b>  I know that, fool, but what was it that he did?</span></p> <p><span><b>Chebrikov:</b>  Well sir, last week in his syndicated column, which hundreds of papers around the country carry, he launched an attack on Derek Bok, the president of that bastion of capitalism, Harvard University.</span></p> <p><span><b>Chernenko:</b>  Oh yes, I remember that guy Back before he took over from Leonid.  Yuri had your boys do a check on him Tried to get him to acquiesce in our subversion campaign against Harvard students.  It was no problem.  We got that Core passed through the Faculty with barely a whimper.  So what's going on in Cambridge?</span></p> <p><span><b>Chebrikov:</b>  It seems that another one of our operatives, an alert alumnus of that famous school, whose name I cannot divulge, tried to whip up a little more anti-Communist feeling.  He wrote a letter to Bok, very cleverly, criticizing the fact that Harvard had on its Faculty an avowed communist that despicable revanchist, Kautskian John Womack, who has brown-nosed his way to the head of the History Department there.</span></p> <p><span><b>Chernenko:</b>  Oh Womack, not that odious weasel'</span></p> <p><span><b>Chebrikov:</b>  Yes, the weasel himself Well.  Bok, like the good capitalist that he is, responded with a lot of that dreck about academic freedom, you know the kind of principle those Americans get all sanctimonious about.</span></p> <p><span>Bok wrote to our agent, \"The fact that he is a communist is not, of itself, a matter of concern to us so long as he does not seek to indoctrinate his students.  I might add that although most Harvard professors are somewhere in the normal Republican-Democratic range of political viewpoints, we do have some faculty members who fall outside this spectrum, being either libertarians or communists or goodness knows what.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Chernenko:</b>  These Americans are crazy!  What is this new ideology they call \"goodness knows what\"?  They are always trying to come up with some new political gizmo--luckily for us, we always have old Karl and Vladimir llyich to turn to, Oh well...</span></p> <p><span><b>Cherbrikov:</b>  Comrade, don't fall asleep yet; there is more.  Bok also said, \"May I also say that all American universities subscribe to the tenets of academic freedom, which clearly embody the right of all professors to entertain any political views they choose so long as they carry out their duties without being subject to interference or prejudice on the part of the institution that hires them.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Chernenko:</b>  That Bok!  That is the kind of capitalist reasonableness that will delay the Revolution in that country for an epoch.  So what did Buckley then write?</span></p> <p><span><b>Chebrikov:</b>  Well that clumsy fool took the bait, and he started an anti-Bok campaign, blasting the president for allowing, nay, even rejoicing in the fact that this man Womack was on the Harvard faculty.  Buckley took that liberal goo-goo and his fuddy-duddy academic freedom to task, but as he is so accustomed to do he went too far.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is no such thing as a Nazi who is also qualified to teach in a community of scholars.  Nor is there such a thing as a communist qualified to teach in a community of scholars,\" Buckley wrote.  \"The only thing more anaesthetizing to moral sensibilities than to have a communist on a faculty of a college is to have as its president someone who can not penetrate that distinction.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Chernenko:</b>  Oh Chebbie, we should sign that man up for Kremlin speech-writing; he has such a catchy turn of the phrase.  But what a <i>dumkopf!</i> Doesn't Buckley know that that kind of posturing only caters to the peaceniks and the detentists?  I can already hear the shrieking in the halls of Harvard, about blacklisting and freedom of speech and all that other liberal clap-trap.</span></p> <p><span><b>Chebrikov:</b>  Oh yes I know sir, the liberal press will be able to use this, just as it was able to use Reagan's \"evil empire\" speech to foment unease among the moderates and people who want to talk with us.  Did you notice, something may even be wrong with Reagan?</span></p> <p><span><b>Chernenko:</b>  What do you mean, Viktor?</span></p> <p><span><b>Chebrikov:</b>  Well, I stress I am now only speculating, but we think the American CIA has now started to suspect our disinformation techniques, and they are responding tit for tat.  Did you hear what Reagan said \"off the record\" before his radio broadcast on Saturday:  \"My fellow Americans.  I am pleased to announce I just signed legislation banning Russia forever.  We begin bombing in five minutes.\"  Can you imagine the field day the arms controllers are going to have.  We could well have to go back to Geneva!</span></p> <p><span><b>Chernenko:</b>  Well, it looks like you guys have really screwed this one up.  What are you going to do about it, or did I hear you say you like Siberia in the summertime?</span></p> <p><span><b>Chebrikov:</b>  No, nothing of the sort!  We are going to have to live with Womack for a while:  he is scheduled to remain chairman of Harvard's History department for one more year.  Our only danger is that our chief moles at Harvard, the Republican Club, will froth like they did last year when they attacked Womack and that wimpy liberal Stanley Hoffman as an example of Harvard's purportedly leftist faculty.  That would undoubtedly whip up more liberal sentiment, the kind of goo-goo feeling I don't like to deal with.</span></p> <p><span><b>Chernenko:</b>  Me neither, but, I repeat, what are we going to do about it?</span></p> <p><span><b>Cherbrikov:</b>  Well, if we can't neutralize Womack, then I suggest much more drastic action.  We must get that guy, that Polish history teacher...what is his name, oh yes, Pipes, back to Washington as soon as possible.  That is our only hope.  Otherwise the Revolution is lost in Cambridge.  I'll get my boys on it right away.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Bumper Car Philosophy | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>D</b>O YOU HAVE the guts?  Would you kill millions of innocent men, women, and children, and possibly destroy the world, because the Soviet Union lobbed a few hundred-megaton nuclear warheads on the fair old U.S. of A.?  The question is, of course, heavily loaded; and answering 'no' is crucial to coming to terms with Jonathan Schell's latest epistle.  <i>The Abolition.</i></span></p> <p><span>Asking, \"Do you dare?\"  is more than an exercise in Alan Alda Yuppiedom:  it lies at the crux of deterrence theory, a theory that Schell painstakingly and convincingly shows is as out-of-date as John Wayne machismo.</span></p> <p><span>Schell, if you remember, is the sanctimonious New Yorker staff writer who penned the hopelessly whiny, self-righteous.  <i>Fate of the Earth,</i> which many on the Left and in the Dovish Center embraced as the anti-nuke Bible.</span></p> <p><span><i>Fate</i> was the most irritating of essays, describing ad nauseum the effects of nuclear war on every manner of life imaginable, and then proposing that we save all the cute furry animals and our children by forming a world government.  Schell simply wasn't playing by political science rules--one doesn't simply say things are awful and then prescribe the best of all possible worlds.</span></p> <p><span>Schell obviously understood this, and <i>The Abolition</i> hastily debunks much of what Schell, with much hoopla, put forth two years ago.  In fact, the author, with customary hubris, goes so far as to quote his previous work as an example of a historic consensus:  world government can be the only real solution to the nuclear crisis--this consensus, by the way, includes such luminaries as nuke guru.  Herman Kahn, Harvard's Living With Nuclear Weapons gang, MIT nuclear specialist George Rathjens.  Bertrand Russell, Grenville Clark, and Louis B. Sohn Schell explains parenthetically.  \"I take the liberty of quoting myself again only because I wish to acknowledge my former adherence to a point of view with which I now propose to argue.\"</span></p> <p><span>It is good that the author saw in 1984 what most involved in the nuts and-bolts of nuclear policy took as a given two years ago, but his bumper car style of dealing with theories and solutions give him what Walter I. Mondale would call a \"credibility gap.\"</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps, then, the best way to approach <i>The Abolition</i> is to forget that Schell ever wrote <i>Late of the Earth.</i>  If <i>Abolition</i> were a laundry detergent, it would be labelled \"all new and improved,\" and housewives and husbands in TV ads would be shown embracing the new product while blithely tossing the old into the trash.</span></p> <p><span>But this Schell product really is new and improved.  Finding Schell back on terra firm a must be welcome to those who--like their progressive idealists flexing their thinking muscles in the realm of the possible.  Forget world government, now you get a policy that is not simplistic, and--if one stretches the definition of 'possible' to its utmost breaking point--maybe even workable.  There are, of course, still many bugs to be worked out in the new product.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE DELIBERATE POLICY\" put forth in <i>The Abolition</i> in a nutshell, is to persuade all nations to destroy their nuclear weapons (zap!), while allowing and encouraging open deployment of defensive anti-nuclear weaponry.  This defense--which would possibly include something along of President Reagan's oft-ridiculed \"Star Wars\" weapons--would primarily ensure the capacity to build new nuclear warheads, should another country feel like breaking the <i>pan</i> pact.</span></p> <p><span>The proposal doesn't \"uninvent\" nuclear weaponry--Schell concedes that is impossible but rather seeks to use the everlasting knowledge of how to construct nukes as deterrent against another power attempting nuclear blackmail.  The difference is that, instead of the current seven minute time lapse between the commencement of hostilities and Armageddon, the lag would be anywhere from a week to a few months</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, this state of what Schell calls \"existential deterrence\" would set the stage for deeper, more lasting agreements between the superpowers.  These agreements are not described; Schell merely writes:</span></p> <p><span>The abolition agreement described here can be seen as a mere holding operation, giving us time in which these good qualities [of courage, trust, prudence, imagination, decency, and love] can be brought to bear on the vast political work that alone can lead to a true and fully satisfactory resolution of the nuclear predicament.</span></p> <p><span>Schell's optimism and self-conscious naivete are clearly heartfelt, but they do not alone make policy, and the author's bouts of wishful thinking only underscore the incompleteness of the more complete proposals.  They also beg the two crucial questions that Schell leaves unanswered; namely, how does one convince a country to abandon all its weapons?  and, once Schell's plan is put into effect, how do we make a clean break with our policy of deference, a policy that he has convincingly argued always carries the threat of nuclear holocaust?</span></p> <p><span>Given that we cannot even hold talks with the Soviets on freezing our nuclear arsenals, finding a way to dismantle the whole lot is a heady task indeed.  And, if Schell's list of positive human attributes ever did hold away in foreign policy matters, we probably wouldn't have to bother with his complicated solution at all</span></p> <p><span>It is also curious that Schell's proposal never departs from the commonly accepted deference theory that has ruled the Nuclear Age.  Curious, because Schell uses the first half of the book to convincingly argue that deference theory is a contradictory, dangerous, inhuman, and without credibility.  He asks us if we would date sacrifice the world to uphold our sovereignty, confident that the only sane and rational answer is \"no.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT HIS PROPOSAL leaves that same horrific and impossible threat of global extinction in place.  An agressor in a non-nuclear world could still kill millions, though not as fast, and passive nations would still have to threaten global extinction to stop the agressor from letting the rockets fly.  The threat of extinction is still there, just the mechanisms are slower</span></p> <p><span>Schell acknowledges the continued primacy of deference in his non nuclear world:  in fact, he applauds in part II what he successfully debunked in part I.  He sets a trap for the conventional thinkers of the world, and then, eyes open walks right into it.  Of course, the matter is not that simple.  Schell's deference would be the result of the massing of defensive weaponry (supposedly ABMs or space weapons, he does not say).  But such deference, by its very nature, is doomed to imperfection, and given present and near future technology, there is no politically or militarily credible defense against nuclear attack.  Does Schell share the President's jingoistic optimism that throwing a few billion Pentagon dollars at some American scientists will save the U.S. and the world from extinction and or Communism?</span></p> <p><span>Probably not, but Schell, like every other person who is looking for ways out of the nuclear morass, is torn by the conflicting pulls of realism and idealism.  While interpreting much of the nuclear debate to this point as a debate between the two approaches to problem solving.  Schell does not show his own stripes as he did (to little effect) in <i>Fate of the Earth.</i>  One part of Schell Model '84 is saying blast nationalism and provincialism and advocate a King Solomon of a world government that will solve everything; the other is looking for solutions within the traditional framework of deference and inviolate sovereignty.</span></p> <p><span>The result is that Schell is neither here nor there; he cannot please the million marchers in Central Park who demand simply and unequivocally.  \"No more nukes:\"  and those who want a solution they can push through Congress and then through the Kremlin.  Of course, this seeming conflict has always tied anti-nuke thinkers up in knots, and that's too bad.</span></p> <p><span>As Schell himself notes advances in the realm of the political and in the realm of the theoretical are mutually beneficial.  Each new foray into an imagined world where we do not live our lives knowing we could extinguished like a cigarette butt makes real change more acceptable and more possible.  And even Schell, with his inconsistent rhetoric, is bringing the discussion of a non-nuclear world from the political fringes to the forefront of political dialogue.</span></p>"}

{"title": "SummerBooksSummerBooksSum | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>N</b>FOLIBERALISM exists only on an elite axis that runs between Cambridge, New York, and Washington.  It is a faddish strain of thinking among Fast Coast eggheads who like to fashion movements that as a concept holds out some promise.  Once someone thought up the word neoconservative, neoliberalism was not long in coming, as has been made clear in the pages of the New Republic, the Washington Monthly, the Atlantic and other journals of the cognoscenti.  Gurus abound in the likes of Robert Reich, I ester Thurow, and Charles Peters--and there are plenty of politicians who have been ready and willing to take up the \"new ideas\" cudgel:  Sen. Gary W. Hart (D-Colo.). Sen Paul E. Tsongas (D-Mass.). Rep. Timothy Wirth (D-Colo.).  And there are, of course, the requisite buzzwords:  industrial policy, human capital and military reform are the current faces.</span></p> <p><span>But outside of the editorial offices and lecture halls of the Eastern establishment, it is hard to see the viability of neoliberalism.  No one, first of all, has been able to define the philosophy as anything more precise than a worthwhile desire to move beyond the traditional New Deal industrialism of the Democratic Party?  And more seriously, the purported neoliberals have yet to show the political muscle--or even the instincts--to turn their ideas into workable policies.  These weaknesses have dogged \"neoliberalism\" since pundits first began using the word in the aftermath of the Carter presidency, and they have yet to be adequately addressed since--problems suggested, perhaps unwittingly, in Randall Rothenberg's <i>The Neoliberals:  Creating the New American Politics.</i></span></p> <p><span>Rothenberg's purpose in this book is to describe the personalities and ideas that have been grouped under the term of neoliberalism--certainly no easy task.  Tsongas, the Massachusetts senator who was in early on the idea, has called it \"compassionate liberalism,\" Rothenberg tells us, and Sen. Gary W. Hart (D-Colo.), who has wrung it for all its worth, has dubbed it \"Prairie Populist Jeffersonian democracy.\"  A better term is \"anything but\"--that is, anything but the formulas of the New Deal, from which neoliberals recoil in horror.  Despite his deadly earnest attempt, Rothenberg doesn't really help us in the quest for definition.  Grouping as disparate politicians as North Carolina's Gov. James Hunt (a conservative in disguise).  Timothy Wirth (a high-techie), and former California Gov. Jerry Brown (a flake) under the rubric of neoliberalism only confirms the impression that the label is of use solely to the self-serving cognoscenti.</span></p> <p><span>Rothenberg is merely the latest John Naisbitt apostle scurrying to discover, the latest mega trend.  As the term has evolved, it has come to take into account almost every purported new idea under the Democratic Sun.  Hence Jim Hunt's intensive efforts on the part of education in his home state of North Carolina are seen as one manifestation of the new philosophy, and James Fallow' 70 work on military reform comes under the classification as well.  Facile nomenclature is slung around this book with case, as we learn that neoliberals esteem, among other people and principles:  decentralization, investment, microeconomics, Joseph Schumpeter, entrepencurialism, \"maneuver warfare,\" growth, high technology, and hurrah for them, the \"national interest.\"</span></p> <p><span>There is, after slogging through Rothenberg's exhaustive survey of the neoliberal agenda, almost nothing that emerges as characteristic, except perhaps a cautious pragmatism.  Anyone who professes the slightest skepticism for traditional' Democratic interest group politics can join the club.  Content to spout generalities about, basically, the current generation of new Democratic leaders, Rothenberg fails to articulate a set of first principles for this newism.  And so he fails to support one of the principal tenets of his book--that we are dealing with a new American political ideology.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>O WHAT?  one can fairly ask, Rothenberg may be over-zealous in promoting neoliberalism as a coherent ideology, but if the idea is good, why knock it?  And there are, after all, some pretty good ideas that have emanated from the writers, intellectuals and politicians Rothenberg calls neoliberal.  The idea has gotten out--it's hardly a surprise--that maybe the traditional Democratic approaches to things aren't always the best--that there are limits and trade-offs to be made on environmental and economic issues:  that entreprencurs aren't all that had and lawyers may be overrated; and that liberals won't shame themselves by showing a little interest in military policy beyond taking the at to the defense budget.  Making pragmatism progressive, or vice-versa, is a worthwhile enterprise, no matter the political season.</span></p> <p><span>It's the method of neoliberalism that strikes one not only as muddle-headed, but also a tad naive.  Rothenberg writes, correctly, of the frustration of many of the new breed of Democrats with the traditional party dependence on interest groups, i.e. big labor.  He notes the explicit appeal--as was amply demonstrated by Gary Hart's presidential pitch--to rise above this sectarian approach to things, to realize that governing does not mean pandering piecemeal to every possible constituency.  And he properly makes the comment that all this being said, the call for the \"national interest\" as opposed to the \"special interest\" is in itself a political ploy on the part of those he calls neoliberals.  \"If one thing rings false in all the rhetoric of neoliberalism.\"  Rothenberg writes near the end, \"it is that the 'national interest' may be nothing more than than the special interests of the liberal upper middle class.\"</span></p> <p><span>Rothenberg, unfortunately, does not push his skepticism far enough.  In appealing to pragmatism and rising above the special interests, the neoliberals act as if they were the first to dream up some of their schemes to, for example, reform the military or revive growth; their approach often borders on extreme arrogance.  The military reformers talk with some merit, about the necessity for liberals to take defense matters more seriously and they exhort the Army to improve cohesion and morale, never bad advice.  But they they ignore the long stream of institutional interests in the subject that has been stymied simply by the normal difficulty of getting something changed in the armed forces, not necessarily because of the stupidity writers often impute to the officer corps.  In much the same way, economic reformers talk glibly about fostering more cooperation between business labor, and government--an idea going around for quite some time now--but by and large they don't specify how this is going to come about.  Instead, they are content to excoriate union leaders for being \"short-sighted\" and businessmen for being \"greedy.\"</span></p> <p><span>For politicians who pride themselves on being so pragmatic, people like Gary Hart, Jerry Brown, and Timothy Wirth--three of the men Rothenberg discusses at length (he discusses to women)--their failure often to get things done politically is striking, as anyone who remembers the Medfly fiasco in California can attest to.  Others of this breed seem more sensible, a Tsongas or a Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.).  Rothenberg writes of the way similar rhetoric characterizes the neoliberals.  That's well enough, but behind this rhetoric there is a distinct lack of the coalition-building and bridge-crossing that makes politics work, a significant irony in light of the renewed call for cooperation among the country's various constituencies.  Americans aren't normally fooled by rhetoric--though the Reagan presidency is a notable exception--and they got tired after a while of Hart's beef-less call for a \"new generation of leadership.\"</span></p> <p><span>That campaign was beef-less not so much in its ideas, but in its inability to broaden its appeal to include the constituencies necessary for a Democratic victory in the fall-labor and minorities.  The fact of the matter is that there has been a Republican electoral majority out there for nearly two decades now--the sun-beliers, the Bible-beliers, the free-marketers, the right-to-lifers--grouped under the aegis of less government.  Thus the Republicans, as Rothenberg points out, have a luxury the Democrats don't--a simplistic unifying theme.  The way to fight this is not through trying to invent new-ideologies, but to recognize that there are a host of good ideas in the party, get people to talk about them, and try to work out some compromises--keeping in mind the party's moral obligation to the sick and the poor.  The \"family of America\" theme that New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo struck in his speech to the Democratic Convention was the perfect message to carry to the electorate.</span></p> <p><span>For all the book's weakness Rothenberg must be credited for hi general diligence in outlining without a lot of cheerleading the basic ideas and personalities of most of the new batch of Democratic leaders and intellectuals.  But he does get carried away.  \"Forget about Walter Mondale, ignore John Glenn, put Tip O'Neil out of your mind.\"  Rothenberg froths.  \"Disregard the Democratic Party as you've known it.  Whatever its fortunes in 1984, the old liberalism has already begun a slow, inexorable fate.  The future belongs to the neoliberals.\"  The prognosis inaccuracy is overshadowed only by its stupidity as political advice.</span></p>"}

Are we getting involved in another Vietnam?\"' Karnow said recently over coffee and Gitanes in Boston.</span></p> <p><span>The gruff-voiced Karnow, who began reporting from Southeast Asia in 1959 for <i>Time</i> and <i>Life,</i> makes a point of not capitalizing on isolationist sentiment aroused by Vietnam, though he understands that much of the interest among college-age students stems from just such a concern.</span></p> <p><span>The so-called Vietnam legacy is a potent political tool these days, and Karnow, who makes strong claims to historical objectivity in his book and documentary, must realize that his current educational mission can only work to raise fears about any military involvement abroad.</span></p> <p><span>At the least, Karnow finds the public and Congress much more conscious of foreign policy matters today than they were in 1964, when 16,000 military advisors were stationed in Vietnam and the U.S. government was spending half a billion dollars a year on operations there.</span></p> <p><span>\"A public opinion survey [in 1964] asked the question 'What should we do next in Vietnam?'  and 70 percent of the answers were.  'We're not paying attention to it'.\"  Karnow recalled.  \"Today the opinion polls show <i>far</i> greater interest on the part of the public and much greater caution about involvement, not only in Vietnam, but in other places.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N THE CASE of Central America, Karnow argues that Vietnam has not made the U.S. public gun shy, but rather more inclined to protect the national interest through non-violent means.  It seems, however, that Karnow is underestmating the sway Vietnam holds over the thinking of the 18-25 crowd, which forms a large part of Karnow's lecture-circuit audience.</span></p> <p><span>One recent manifestation of the \"no-more-Vietnams\" sentiment among youth was the surge of support for Sen. Gary W. Hart (D-Colo.) in the recent primaries after Hart, without the sublety or the shadings of a Karnow or even a Walter F. Mondale, advocated an unequivocal non-interventionist line <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Middle East and Central America.</span></p> <p><span>Though the appeal of the Hart pitch is understandable, it is exactly the type of misguided response Karnow says he is trying to avoid.</span></p> <p><span>Karnow probably realizes that the increased awareness about Vietnam--which he obviously finds beneficial for the country--could be channeled into a more explicitly isolationist foreign policy and a butt-headed unwillingness among youth to involve itself in any military enterprise to defend the national interest.</span></p> <p><span>To counter this, Karnow seems to come off as more conservative--or at least moderate--than he would otherwise.  He notes that most criticism of his PBS series has come from the left end of the political spectrum.  But his pitch is basically non-ideological.  He demands that we know more than a superficial history of Vietnam--his book traces Western involvement in the region back five centuries--but also that we know when and when not to use that knowledge.</span></p> <p><span>Karnow cites Dean Rusk, secretary of state to John F. Kennedy '40 and Lyndon B. Johnson and a man involved in Far East policy for three decades, as a prime example of someone who failed to use history properly.  \"I went down to Athens.  Georgia to interview Dean Rusk, and said what was your mindset, what was your thinking, and he said.  'I was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford in 1933, and I was there at the Oxford Union that night when they voted not to fight for King and country.  I could remember that the Berlin Radio used that the next day or the next week as a sign of how soft the British were and the British were ready to appease the Nazis, and I vowed then and there that we had to stop aggression whenever it took place.'\"</span></p> <p><span>Karnow added, \"He carried that same memory into the fifties and the sixties, and Nazi aggression and Nazi expansionism in Europe in the thirties had nothing to do with the Vietnam War.  It was a totally different situation.\"</span></p> <p><span>If history really does \"cut both ways,\" as Karnow says, then we must find a foreign policy that winds a middle road between those who are continuously refighting the second World War and those who are forever refighting Vietnam.  It has been exactly our reliance on historical precedents--be they proper or improper--that makes us see what is not there or become blind to the real threats.</span></p> <p><span>Says Karnow, \"What is important in dealing with any area, whether you're dealing with Vietnam, or Central America, or the Middle East, or Western Europe, is take it all case-by-case.  Try to understand the realities of each area you are going to get involved in, and don't come out of it with cockeyed analogies.\"</span></p> <p><span>In these days of wild adventurism and stubborn isolationism, this is good advice indeed.</span></p>"}

Philip L. Shea (D-Lowell), the chairman of the Democratic State Committee, are diametrically opposed in almost every way; where Atkins is a wealthy blue-blood living off a Swiss trues fund, Shea is strongly rooted in the industrial culture of lower middle-class Lowell; where Atkins is suave, Shea can be brutish, where Atkins toes the solid liberal line.  Shea wavers week, the ideological poles of the Democratic party; where Atkins is in with the party bigwigs in Boston, Shea is strong with the local pols in Lowell and Lawrence.</span></p> <p><span>Each has a strong best, in this eclectic district, which has made this year's a race more interesting and more complen than most contests between rising Party superstars and old-time hometown pols.</span></p> <p><span>On a map, the fifth congressional district looks something like a pserodactyl.  Its tall stretches out to Wess Townsend, the westernmost Lincoln in Middlesex County, the body takes contains the affident, liberal heartland of Concern, Weston, Lincoln and Sudbury and the booming high tech area around Route 128 and Interstate 495.  To the north, Lowell and Lawrence, two mill towns trying to stage comebacks stick out like a clumsy head.</span></p> <p><span>In all, there are about 368,000 people voting age in the area to the 1900 census.  While liberals hold away in the rural suburbs in the district's left-leaning mid-section, President Reagan's appeal to the blue-collar, Catholic vote--which is centered in Lowell and Lawrence--worked here in 1980.  Reagan carried the district 44 to 40 percent over former President Jimmy Carter, a margin of 11,000 votes and two percentage points better than the state total.</span></p> <p><span>Shea, despite a litany of last-minute legislative flip-flops designed to make him look more liberal which have been duly noted by Atkins, has an immensely strong political base in his hometown of more than 80,000 residents.  As a former city councilman and Lowell's representative to the Massachusetts House, Shea is credited by Lowellians with bringing in millions of government dollars to fix up the city's flagging downtown over the last 10 years.  That shot in the arm from the state and federal governments has in turn attracted business back to the city.  Wang Labs has opened up a plant in Lowell, and the huge Courier Printing Co., which produces, among other things, every single telephone book distributed in New England, has bolstered the Lowell economy.</span></p> <p><span>But of late, Shea--who has a conservative legislative record--has been getting into trouble during his showdown with Atkins.  Over the summer, Shea has uncharacteristically backed liberal positions on the nuclear freeze, the Equal Rights Amendment, cuts in military spending, foreign policy in Latin America, and ways to reduce the federal deficit, the plans for the latter released last week in a 40-page statement released last week.  He has shut up about the causes he pushed hardest for as a legislator:  amending the Massachusetts constitution to outlaw abortion, killing gay rights legislation and supporting the death penalty.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, while he says he supports the ERA, as a representative in the Massachusetts House he didn't vote on the issue when it first came up in 1973.  While he says he supports the freeze, he voted in 1982 for amendments to a proposed freeze referendum which would have rendered it meaningless.  Shea would have added two questions to the referendum asking voters if they would still approve a freeze if it would make the U.S. weaker than the Soviet Union, and asking voters if the President should propose reducing minutes and aircraft instead of warhends.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>n retorting, Shea has attacked Atkins for failing to blow the whistle on the worst excesses of the Senate President, Atkins buddy and legislative strongman William F. Bulger (D-Boston).  For instance, Atkins, who a chairman of the Ways and Means committee is the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, did nothing to stop legislators who granted themselves a \"Halloween.  Night pay raise\" two years ago without floor debate or recorded vote.  Atkins claimed he opposed the pay raise amendment while it was in Ways and Means and that he \"took a walk\" while legislators held a voice vote on the raise late in a session that ran well toward sunrise.  Shea said Atkins should have taken steps to oppose the surreptitious pay raise.</span></p> <p><span>Shea also last month signed a pledge never knowingly to accept political action committee money in any campaign ever, and said he would resign any seat if he found out PAC money leaked into his campaign fund.  He is trying to make political capital out of Atkins's refusal to sign a similar pledge.</span></p> <p><span>Atkins has perhaps been more effective than Shea in his rhetorical attacks, making political capitol out of Shea's poor voting record.  Shea missed one-quarter of all senate vote last year, including some on important legislator, Shea claimed he was sick with preumonia, but Atkins pointed out that Shea could have voted by proxy.</span></p> <p><span>Faced with two candidates whom each seem to appeal to exactly half the district, local political observers are calling the Shea-Atkins race one of the closest ever.  Atkins, with his long-standing calls for a nuclear freeze and for more federal education money, is running strong in the heart of the district, the Concord area, according to Genevera Counihan, Democratic Town Committee co-chairman in Concord.  And Counihan, whose committee endorsed hometown boy Atkins, says people in her area aren't fooled by the new Shea.  \"Shea is much more liberal than I have known him to be,\" Counihan says dryly.  \"He seems to have changed most of his positions.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Atkins is outgunned in Lowell and Lawrence, the other half of the Fifth District, big population centers which want more of the kind of revitalization Shea delivered for his home city.  \"Shea will take a good percentage here.  Atkins has his work cut out for him,\" said Duke Juknovarian, chairman of the Lowell Democratic Committee, which four years ago adopted a policy of not endorsing candidates in the primary.  In my 40 years in politics, I've never seen a fight like this.  It's a tossup for the district.\"</span></p>"}

In 1924, the state offered up the Republican's Republican.  Calvin Coolidge.

The Yankee Protestants, allied with the Republican party, had historically opposed the Irish Catholic immigrants, who found political voice in the Democratic party.</span></p> <p><span>The deep resentment toward the Irish immigrants led to deep religious, cultural, and economic divisions between the parties--division which, for the most part, were non-ideological.

Senate President William M. Bulger (D-Boston) and House Speaker Thomas W. McGee (D-Lynn) are considered centrist, if not non-ideological, and liberals like Sen. George Bachrach (D-Watertown) and Sen. Jack H. Backman (D-Brookline) have little influence on policy matters.</span></p> <p><span>But the demographics of state electoral politics appear to be changing, and the Republican Party machinery has long since excised the more liberal Yankees from its ranks--its two most visible members, Senate candidate Elliot L.

Andrew Natsios, the party chairman, the sole Congressman Conte, and the minority leadership in both houses of the legislature as evidence that the days of Yankee Republicanism are long past.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, the friction--many Republicans use the term \"war\"--between the liberal Yankees and the populist-conservative ethnics continues, with each wing blaming the other for the Party's inability to make a dent on the state political scene.</span></p> <p><span>\"We can't nominate the liberals and out-liberal the Democrats,\" says Gordon Nelson, a former state party chairman and a leader of the party's right wing.  \"Richardson is the type of candidate who used to win in this state, but no longer.  That strategy doesn't work here anymore.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nelson cites a string of liberal republican candidates, including Sears in 1982, gubernatorial candidate Francis W. Hatch, Jr. in '78, and Senator Ed Brooke in '78, who lost to Democrats.  The reason, he says, is that they did not represent their real constituency, the working class Republicans and the conservative Democrats that booted Dukakis out of office in '78 in favor of right-wing Democrat Edward J. King.</span></p> <p><span>The party must now strongly identify with President Reagan, who carried the state by 2421 votes out of nearly 2.5 million cast, he says.  \"Among those 200,000 people who vote in the Republican party, the most popular person is not Ray Shamie or Elliot Richardson, but Ronald Reagan.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>ut Republican moderates and liberals argue that the party's problems stem not from too liberal candidates, but rather from the Republican leadership's drift toward the right.  They say the party's fortunes reached a nadir under the leadership of the likes of Gordon Nelson, whom Sears describes as \"not only in right field but beyond the foul pole.\"</span></p> <p><span>Says liberal State Rep. Thomas J. Vallely (D-Boston).  \"The Massachusetts republicans are dominated by the conservative wing of the party.  But where the conservative movement has an intellectual underpinning around the country, there is no intellectual base in the state.\"</span></p> <p><span>Democrats, say they have continued to dominate in state because they have captured the large moderate block in the electorate, most of whom are registered in neither party.  The vote worked to their advantage in 1982, when Democrats--again with the exception of Silvio Conte--won every congressional race, the gubernatorial race, and the Senate race, with at least 58 percent of the vote.  Rep. Barney M. Frank '62 (D-Newton Highland) swamped his Republican opponent Margaret M. Heckler, now secretary of Health and Human Services in the Reagan Administration, by a three-to-two margin in what had been expected to be a tight race.</span></p> <p><span>Frank says the Democratic landslide in the state two years ago is proof that Reagan-brand conservatism is not a big draw in the state.  Shamie, touting Reaganite ideology, pumped $2.3 million, most of it his own money, into his '82 Senate campaign against Ted Kennedy, but still received only 38 percent of the general election vote.</span></p> <p><span>\"We keep winning because the Republican party is moving ideologically further right,\" Frank says.  \"We have no real organizational strength around the state; the Republicans are just an extreme right-wing party.\"</span></p> <p><span>* * *</span></p> <p><span>State Republican leaders, while lamenting their party's fortunes, appear to have no real remedy for their problems.  The strategy conducted by younger, more conservative Republicans of identifying with the President may not pay off.  Much of the Reagan support came from a dislike of Jimmy Carter, not because the state had made a rightward swing.  The true test will be in November, when Reagan takes on the Dukakis machine in the state.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the profusions of the party's right wing and the recent success of candidate Shamie, there is little evidence that the Republicans will begin offering a spate of Jack Kemp clones for statewide office to the exclusion of party moderates.</span></p> <p><span>Natsios, considered one of the most astute politicians in the party, is a strong supporter of Vice-President Bush, and has few kind words for the populist-conservative movement that controlled the party platform in Dallas.  He predicts that most of the Republican brass will support the more moderate Bush in the '88 Presidential sweepstakes.</span></p> <p><span>Though Reagan may pull a few local legislators into office on his coattails, the Republicans will need a more permanent boost to break out of their decade-long doldrums.  Despite the Republican Party's strong pro-business stance, the corporate money in Massachusetts is going to the Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>Republican legislators, both moderate and conservative, openly play with the idea of scrapping the Republican Party and starting up a new group.  But given the cold war between the two wings of the party, the would-be party-former would be hard pressed to give it a name.</span></p> <p><span>The Liberal-Monetarist Party?</span></p>"}

The panel gave Bank St. slightly higher marks for technical merit and economy, but Justiz was understood to have chosen Harvard because of the larger scope of its proposal and its greater resources.</span></p> <p><span>Bank St. was also angry over charges that another NIE official had given Harvard and MIT, which was also bidding for the grant, an unfair advantage by informing the schools that their bids more $2 million over the agency's estimate for the project.</span></p> <p><span>Both Harvard and MIT subsequently lowered their bids to near NIE's $7.7 million figure while Bank St. remained unaware that it had underbid dramatically with its $4.5 million proposal.</span></p> <p><span>In squashing Bank St.'s complaints, the GAO ruled that the regulations governing the competition were matters of internal policy guidance--not law--and hence not grounds for disallowing the contract.  Bank St. has vowed to appeal, but time rolls on and Harvard's new center will soon move into its second year of operation.</span></p> <p><span><b>Discoveries</b></span></p> <p><span>Students leave Cambridge in June, but most professors do not, especially scientists, whose lab experiments do not run by the academic calendar.  The past summer saw a number of Harvard scientists step into the limelight with the announcement of a new finding or discovery.</span></p> <p><span>For Carlo Rubbia, public attention is becoming old hat.  Rubbia, professor of Physics, smashes atoms--a particularly fruitful line of work of late--and he has been doing ground-breaking experimentation that scientists hope will confirm much recent theoretical thinking about the forces of nature.</span></p> <p><span>This summer Rubbia found the sixth quark, one of the most sought-after discoveries in modern physics.  Quarks are thought to be the basic building blocks of all larger atomic particles.  Scientists have long predicted the existence of six quarks; five were known, and Rubbia's finding completed the roster.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard scientists also announced progress in another hot area of scientific research--the battle to fight Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).  A number of researchers at the School of Public Health have been at the forefront of the fight against this often deadly killer, which has disproportianately affected gay men.</span></p> <p><span>This summer a team led by Associate Professor of Microbiology William A. Haseltine announced that it may have found a gene that is responsible for the disease, as well as certain kinds of cancer.</span></p> <p><span>Haseltine and his associates figured out how a leukemia virus--known as HTLV-1--takes control and infects blood cells.  They believe that a similar process is at work when HTLV-3 viruses--which is believed to be the cause of AIDS--attack cells.  And they think that some genetic material in this family of viruses is the culprit.</span></p> <p><span>But perhaps the most widely publicized scientific event of the summer was not a discovery but a saving.  Harvard doctors used a new method of growing sheets of skin from tiny samples to save the lives of two young brothers, who suffered burns over almost all of their bodies in a freak accident.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. Howard Green, chairman of the Physiology Department at the Medical School, has pioneered a method of growing a one-inch-square sample of skin and in three or four weeks cultivating enough new skin to cover an entire body.</span></p> <p><span>The method proved a lifesaver to brothers Jamie and Glen Selby of Caspar, Wyo., who were burned after they playfully painted their bodies, tried to remove the paint with a solvent, and then came into contact with a flame.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. G. Gregory Gallico, a plastic surgeon at the Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital, used skin grown in Green's laboratories to cover the burned bodies, gaining press attention from across the country.</span></p> <p><span><b>Academic Departments</b></span></p> <p><span>One of Harvard's smallest departments, the Celtic Department, completed a major turnover in personnel by hiring a specialist in Irish literature from University College Cork, Ireland.</span></p> <p><span>Sean O'Coileain, a native speaker of Irish, will become the chairman of the only university department in the country devoted solely to Celtic languages and literatures.</span></p> <p><span>The department's previous chairman, Robinson Professor of Celtic Languages and Literature Charles W. Dunn, retired in June.  Another full professor, John V. Kelleher, has moved to part-time duties.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, the Department of Germanic Literatures and Languages broke a long hiring drought by tenuring a Smith College expert in modern German literature.</span></p> <p><span>The appointment of Judith Ryan came after the department had received several turndowns of offers, as well as getting mired in some internal division over what kind of appointments to make.  Ryan becomes the Faculty's 22nd woman tenured professor.</span></p> <p><span>A Cornell German specialist, Sander L. Gilman, is still mulling over a University offer.</span></p> <p><span>The Government Department was also a beehive of activity.</span></p> <p><span>The biggest news was the announcement of an unusual tenure agreement concerning one of Harvard's most famous scholars, Shattuck Professor of Government James Q. Wilson.</span></p> <p><span>Wilson was granted a tenured position at the University of California at Los Angeles.  In what officials termed an unprecedented move, Harvard allowed Wilson to keep his Harvard chair for the next three years, during which he will divide his time between the two schools.</span></p> <p><span>Wilson, a native Californian and one of the country's foremost experts on crime and bureaucracy, said that at the end of the three years he will choose between the two.</span></p> <p><span>Until then he will keep himself busy working on, among other things, on a 26-episode TV series--to be aired on public stations--on crime and criminal behavior.</span></p> <p><span>Department members also announced the revamping of their graduate studies program in what they called the department's biggest reform in 30 years.</span></p> <p><span>Professors said the restructuring and tightening of the requirements for government graduate students grew out of the feeling that the current program was too specialized.  They hope the changes will help the grads where it counts--in finding jobs in the ever-tough academic market.</span></p> <p><span><b>Divinity School</b></span></p> <p><span>Little short of a revelation will startle the quiet scholars who inhabit Andover Hall, but this summer came pretty close.  The Harvard Divinity School is in the midst of an unprecedented turnover in Faculty, and now is looking for seven full-time professors.</span></p> <p><span>The biggest loss was that of Mellon Professor of Divinity Krister Stendahl, who announed plans to leave Harvard this September to become the Bishop of Stockholm in the Church of Sweden.  Stendahl, who came to Harvard from Sweden 30 years ago, is one of the world's foremost authorities on The New Testament, and he served as dean of the school from 1968 to 1979.</span></p> <p><span>Along with his departure, resignations and the coincidental ending of three associate professors' terms put the school in the market for six more professors.  Two of the openings are at the tenured level, and three are at the junior level.  Two others, in Christian historical theology and archaeology, have optional ranks, and the school is reviewing candidates at all levels.</span></p> <p><span>Significantly, among the new openings is the school's first position--a junior-level job--in Afro-American Religion.  The next tenured professor at the school will also be the first such new appointment in seven or eight years, administrators say.  There are 40 faculty members at the Div School, including 15 part-time professors.</span></p> <p><span><b>Controversy</b></span></p> <p><span>Robert M. Coles '50, professor of Psychiatry and Medical Humanities, is no stranger to conflict, but he may have waded into the hottest controversy of his career--children and nuclear war.  For several years now, a group of doctors and psychiatrists, many of them Harvard-affiliated, has put forth the idea that the threat of nuclear war poses a unique psychological danger to children--an idea with which Coles now takes issue.</span></p> <p><span>In a widely publicized speech in Los Alamos, N.M., Coles presented recent research findings in which he attacks as methodologically flawed studies that conclude that the threat of nuclear war has terrorized children.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, says the celebrated child psychiatrist, interviews he conducted around the country indicate that children--especially those from working-class families--have reacted to the nuclear age with far less fear than psychiatric research has indicated.</span></p> <p><span>On other fronts, Harvard professors busily stirred up controversy.  Professor of Law Alan M. Dershowitz began a one-man campaign to get the University to award honorary degrees to Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, his wife Yelena Bonner, and other political prisoners and dissidents.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately for Dershowitz's proposal.  Harvard has a policy of not conferring honorary degrees on people who can't show up in Cambridge personally to receive the honor--a fact cited by President Bok in a letter responding to the professor's request.</span></p> <p><span>But Dershowitz has not given up hope.  \"Bok's attitude is a thing of the past,\" he says.  Expressing hope for a mass movement of students and faculty, he says.  \"Bok doesn't seriously consider things unless he feels that not to do something would create more hassle than to do something.\"</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, yet another outspoken faculty member, Professor of Biology Ruth Hubbard '45, is continuing her crusade to win the right to travel to Cuba.</span></p> <p><span>But that effort was dealt a serious setback when the Supreme Court upheld the Reagan Administration's restrictions on personal travel to the country.  Hubbard and two other women sued President Reagan in 1982 after the government prevented them from going on a fact-finding tour of Cuba.  Hubbard says the group will try to get the High Court to overturn its decision.</span></p> <p><span><b>B-School Subcontracting</b></span></p> <p><span>When the union that represents Harvard's Food Service workers signed a contract with the University last summer--after a one-day flash strike--one of the provisions they won was an agreement that Harvard not sub-contract any of its work out to outside firms if any union employees are laid off or take a cut in hours.</span></p> <p><span>That provision was tested this summer when the Business School decided to hire the Marriott Corporation, a national food chain, to manage its dining halls.  Officials called it an effort to bring the school's facilities up to restaurant standards.</span></p> <p><span>But officials with the union, Local 26 of the Hotel, Restaurant, Institutional Employees and Bartenders Union, expressed fear that the switch may eventually enable Harvard to replace its workers with non-union employees.</span></p> <p><span>For now there will be no change for the Food Service workers at the B-School, who will work for Marriott under the same contract they signed with Harvard.  But Marriott has made no commitment for after the contract expires in 1986, and union officials say it will be a difficult struggle to negotiate a similar pact at that point.</span></p> <p><span><b>In Transition</b></span></p> <p><span>Harvard administrators have big plans to computerize the campus, and a man who will who have a lot of input into the project logged on this summer.</span></p> <p><span>The University tapped Steven C. Hall, a 20-year veteran of the computer industry, to head its Office of Information Technology.  As chief of the office that oversees Harvard's sprawling computer services, Hall is expected to play a major role in helping Harvard set up a network connecting computers around campus.</span></p> <p><span>Those leaving Cambridge, on the other hand, will probably include Bromley Professor of Law Paul M. Bator.  After spending the last 18 months as Deputy Solicitor General in the Justice Department, Bator was tapped by President Reagan for a federal appellate court judgeship.</span></p> <p><span>If Congress approves the nomination as expected, Bator will resign his professorship this fall.</span></p> <p><span>And Professor of Chinese and Central Asian History Joseph F. Fletcher '57, one of the world's leading specialists on inner Asia, died after a long battle with cancer.</span></p> <p><span>Fletcher, who fought to continue teaching despite his illness, was known as an excellent instructor, and won the Levenson Teaching Prize from undergraduates in 1983.  In January 1983, after an extended stay in the hospital, Fletcher returned to his class.  Historical Study B-14.  \"Empire of the Mongols.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"One thing that happens when you face death, as I did and do, is you discover what your priorities are.  It's important to have fun--lots of us forget that,\" he told his students at the time.  \"In facing my priorities,\" he said.  \"I realized I love teaching this course.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Tap Shannon... | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>T WAS PROBABLY mere coincidence that Rep. James M. Shannon (D-Lawrence) and Lt. Gov. John F. Kerry were wearing identical blue suits and red ties at the Sep. 6 Democratic Senate candidates debate.  But the physical and ideological similarities between the two are not.  The \"liberal twins\"--as more moderate contender Michael J. Connolly, the secretary of state, calls them--are both young.  Catholic, well-educated, and products of a post-Vietnam War backlash that has led them to impassioned opposition to U.S. military involvement abroad and the nuclear arms race on moral rather than political grounds.</span></p> <p><span>You're not going to find two more liberal pols than John Kerry and Jim Shannon, even in the People's Republic of Massachusetts, and the temptation is to assume they are identical.  Resist it.  Scrape away the often stale liberal rhetoric and the image mongering, and you will find that Jim Shannon deserves and is more qualified to replace Paul E. Tsongas as this state's junior senator.</span></p> <p><span>Not only does the 32-year-old Shannon have more Washington experience than Kerry, whose lieutenant governor post serves as little more than a political stepping-stone, but he has managed to reach an influential post on the House Ways and Means Committee without compromising his liberal voting record.  Shannon, only 32 years old and finishing only his third term representing the Fifth District north of Boston, has already mastered the art of getting things done.  He is a liberal with clout, and should continue to be effective in stopping and reversing the arms race and pushing for meaningful negotiations with the Soviet Union.  A non-interventionist whose rhetoric occasionally borders on the isolationist.  Shannon will nonetheless provide a strong opposition to President Reagan's tendency toward military adventurism.</span></p> <p><span>Shannon has been among the strongest opponents to Reaganomics in the House, resisting the flow of Democrats votes to the Republican side in the passage of Reagan's 1981 budget and massive three-year tax cut.  Voting in Congress, of course, is more than the pulling of a lever, and we think Shannon, an instant protegee of Speaker of the House Rep. Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill (D-Cambridge), will prove that he is more than a litmus-test liberal.</span></p> <p><span>To do this, Shannon will first have to catch up to front-runner Kerry, who holds a narrow lead in the polls, a lead due largely to the fact that just two years ago he ran a statewide campaign for lieutenant governor.  Kerry, whose main political asset at this point is his high recognition, has persistently attempted, often unfairly, to undercut Shannon's record and has continued to reach for the moral high ground, a spot for which he is not well suited.</span></p> <p><span>The biggest story of the summer's campaigning has been sniping over a $14 million tax break this spring put through the House Ways and Means Committee to a Springfield insurance company that had previously donated $6,000 to Shannon's senate campaign.  According to local press reports--denied by Kerry--the Kerry campaign actively peddled the story to area media and than volunteered that he was shocked and astounded by the revolutions.  It was perhaps poetic justice that an executive of the company revealed that Kerry had approached the same insurance firm for campaign donations, only to be turned down.</span></p> <p><span>It is symptomatic of Kerry's campaign that even his safest proclamations of the liberal creed of morality and care should sound hollow.  He has yet to adequately convince voters that he has evolved from his brash days as leader of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, when he gained a reputation among many as a hollow, unconvincing activist.</span></p> <p><span>Neither of the other two contenders have shows they have much to offer.  David M. Bartley, a university president after leaving the speakership of the Massachusetts House, has been of a disappointment, and his sudden pledge to oppose any tax increases rocks of the worst Reaganaut pandering.  Connolly is distinctive only in that his appearance and gestures bear a remote resemblance to those of Bill Murray.</span></p>"}
{"title": "...or Richardson | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HOUGH THE Democratic battle has attracted most of the media attention so far, the Republican contest between old-line Brahmin guru Elliot L. Richardson '41 and self-made-millionaire-businessman-cum-populist-conservative Ray Shamie has provided a more substantive debate on President Reagan and the future of the ailing state Republican organization.</span></p> <p><span>Shamie, who backs the president on just about every major issue (acid rain is an exception), has jousted with the more liberal Richardson over tax policy, nuclear policy, and U.S. involvement in Central America, and the debate has been interesting if not always effectively argued.</span></p> <p><span>Richardson, who can claim to have held more cabinet posts than any living American, is probably best known for the one thing he didn't do:  fire Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox '34 in October, 1973.  He claims to be most proud of the largely inconclusive Law of Sea Treaty--he headed the U.S. delegation--which Reagan scuttled upon taking office.</span></p> <p><span>Richardson is the kind of guy who could take or leave a senate seat, and only recently has he put any elbow grease into the primary campaign.  We hope he takes the party's nomination, because if the Senate is to have another Republican it should be someone who doesn't belive that Reagan and the far-right Rep. Jack F. Kemp (R-N.Y.), if left to their own devices, would solve the world's problems in seven days.</span></p> <p><span>If the country is to have another Republican senator, let it be a man of Richardson's moderation, experience, and intelligence--and a man who took the platform at the Dallas convention to repudiate the unacceptable Republican Party platform.</span></p>"}

These include volunteers for the Mondale Ferraro presidential campaign and a group called the International Development Forum, which is raising money to aid Bangladesh, according to Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III.</span></p> <p><span>Although there are 150 officially recognized student groups, only the 64 who applied to Epps' office received space in the vast plastic tent attached to the south end of Mem Hall for the occasion.</span></p> <p><span>The locations of the tables, which can be strategic in attempts to corral new members, were determined by the registrar's office in a random lottery.</span></p> <p><span>This number is a substantial increase from last year's 40 or so, according to Epps, who added that the total number of student groups has jumped from approximately 120 five years ago.</span></p> <p><span>Epps said he credits part of the increase in the number of student organizations to the greater availability of funding from the three-year-old Undergraduate Council.</span></p>"}

Harvard doctors used a new method of growing sheets of skin from tiny samples to save the lives of two young brothers, who suffered burns over almost all of their bodies in a freak accident.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. Howard Green, chairman of the Physiology Department at the Medical School, has pioneered a method of growing a one-inch-square sample of skin and in three or four weeks cultivating enough new skin to cover an entire body.</span></p> <p><span>The method proved a lifesaver to brothers Lame and Glen Selby of Caspar, Wyo, who were burned after they playfully painted their bodies, tried to remove the paint with a solvent and then came into contact with a flame.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. G. Gregory Gallico, a plastic surgeon at the Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital, used skin grown in Green's laboratories to cover the burned bodies, gaining press attention from across the country.</span></p> <p><span><b>Academic Departments</b></span></p> <p><span>One of Harvard's smallest departments, the Celtic Department, completed a major turnover in personnel by hiring a specialist in Irish literature from University College Cork, Ireland.</span></p> <p><span>Sean O'Coileam, a native speaker of Irish, will become the chairman of the only university department in the country devoted solely to Celtic languages and literatures.</span></p> <p><span>The department's previous chairman, Robinson Professor of Celtic Languages and Literature Charles W. Dunn, retired in June.  Another full professor, John V. Kelleher, has moved to part-time duties.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, the Department of Germanic Literatures and Languages broke a long hiring drought by tenuring a Smith College expert in modern German literature.</span></p> <p><span>The appointment of Judith Ryan came after the department had received several turndowns of offers, as well as getting mired in some internal division over what kind of appointments to make.  Ryan becomes the Faculty's 22nd woman tenured professor.</span></p> <p><span>A Cornell German specialist, Sander L. Gilman, is still mulling over a University offer.</span></p> <p><span>The Government Department was also a beehive of activity.</span></p> <p><span>The biggest news was the announcement of an unusual tenure agreement concerning one of Harvard's most famous scholars, Shattuck Professor of Government James Q. Wilson.</span></p> <p><span>Wilson was granted a tenured position at the University of California at Los Angeles.  In what officials termed an unprecedented move, Harvard allowed Wilson to keep his Harvard chair for the next three years, during which he will divide his time between the two schools.</span></p> <p><span>Wilson, a native Californian and one of the country's foremost experts on crime and bureaucracy, said that at the end of the three years he will choose between the two.</span></p> <p><span>Until then he will keep himself busy working on, among other things, on a 26-episode TV series--to be aired, on public stations--on crime and criminal behavior.</span></p> <p><span>Department members also announced the revamping of their graduate studies program in what they called the department's biggest reform in 30 years.</span></p> <p><span>Professors said the restructuring and tightening of the requirements for government graduate students grew out of the feeling that the current program was too specialized.  They hope the changes will help the grads where it counts--in finding jobs in the ever-tough academic market.</span></p> <p><span><b>Divinity School</b></span></p> <p><span>Little short of a revelation will startle the quiet scholars who inhabit Andover Hall, but this summer came pretty close.  The Harvard Divinity School is in the midst of an unprecedented turnover in Faculty, and now is looking for seven full-time professors.</span></p> <p><span>The biggest loss was that of Mellon Professor of Divinity Krister Stendahl, who announced plans to leave Harvard this September to become the Bishop of Stockholm in the Church of Sweden Stendahl, who came to Harvard from Sweden 30 years ago, is one of the world's foremost authorities on The New Testament, and he served as dean of the school from 1968 to 1979.</span></p> <p><span>Along with his departure, resignations and the coincidental ending of three associate professors' terms put the school in the market for six more professors.  Two of the openings are at the tenured level, and three are at the junior level.  Two others, in Christian historical theology and archeology, have optional ranks, and the school is reviewing candidates at all levels.</span></p> <p><span>Significantly, among the new openings is the school's first position--a junior-level job--in Afro-American Religion.  The next tenured professor at the school will also be the first such new appointment in seven or eight years, administrators say.  There are 40 faculty members at the Div School, including 15 part-time professors.</span></p> <p><span><b>Controversy</b></span></p> <p><span>Robert M. Coles '50, professor of Psychiatry and Medical Humanities, is no stranger to conflict, but he may have waded into the hottest controversy of his career--children and nuclear war.  For several years now, a group of doctors and psychiatrists, many of them Harvard-affiliated, has put forth the idea that the threat of nuclear war poses a unique psychological danger to children--an idea with which Coles now takes issue.</span></p> <p><span>In a widely publicized speech in Los Alamos, N.M., Coles presented recent research findings in which he attacks as methodologically flawed studies that conclude that the threat of nuclear war has terrorized children.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, says the celebrated child psychiatrist, interviews he conducted around the country indicate that children--especially those from working-class families--have reacted to the nuclear age with far less fear than psychiatric research has indicated.</span></p> <p><span>On other fronts, Harvard professors busily stirred up controversy.  Professor of Law Alan M. Dershowitz began a one-man campaign to get the University to award honorary degrees to Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, his wife Yelena Bonner, and other political prisoners and dissidents.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately for Dershowitz's proposal.  Harvard has a policy of not conferring honorary degrees on people who can't show up in Cambridge personally to receive the honor--a fact cited by President Bok in a letter responding to the professor's request.</span></p> <p><span>But Dershowitz has not given up hope.  \"Bok's attitude is a thing of the past,\" he says.  Expressing hope for a mass movement of students and faculty, he says, \"Bok doesn't seriously consider things unless he feels that not to do something would create more hassle than to do something.\"</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, yet another outspoken faculty member, Professor of Biology Ruth Hubbard '45, is continuing her crusade to win the right to travel to Cuba.</span></p> <p><span>But that effort was dealt a serious setback when the Supreme Court upheld the Reagan Administration's restrictions on personal travel to the country.  Hubbard and two other women sued President Reagan in 1982 after the government prevented them from going on a fact-finding tour of Cuba.  Hubbard says the group will try to get the High Court to overturn its decision.</span></p> <p><span><b>B-School Subcontracting</b></span></p> <p><span>When the union that represents Harvard's Food Service workers signed a contract with the University last summer after a one-day flash strike--one of the provisions they won was an agreement that Harvard not subcontract any of its work out to outside firms if any union employee laid off or take a cut in hours.</span></p> <p><span>That provision was tested this summer when the Business School decided to hire the Marriott Corporation, a national food chain, to manage its dining halls.  Officials called it an effort to bring the school's facilities up to restaurant standards.</span></p> <p><span>But officials with the union, Local 26 of the Hotel, Restaurant, Institutional Employees and Bartenders Union, expressed fear that the switch may eventually enable Harvard to replace its workers with non-union employees.</span></p> <p><span>For now there will be no change for the Food Service workers at the B-School, who will work for Marriott under the same contract they signed with Harvard.  But Marriott has made no commitment for after the contract expires in 1986, and union officials say it will be a difficult struggle to negotiate a similar pact at that point.</span></p> <p><span><b>In Transition</b></span></p> <p><span>Harvard administrators have big plans to computerize the campus, and a man who will who have a lot of input into the project logged on this summer.</span></p> <p><span>The University tapped Steven C. Hall, a 20-year veteran of the computer industry, to head its Office of Information Technology.  As chief of the office that oversees Harvard's sprawling computer services, Hall is expected to play an major role in helping Harvard set up a network connecting computers around campus.</span></p> <p><span>Those leaving Cambridge, on the other hand, will probably include Bromley Professor of Law Paul M. Bator.  After spending the last 18 months as Deputy Solicitor General in the Justice Department, Bator was tapped by President Reagan for a federal appellate court judgeship.</span></p> <p><span>If Congress approves the nomination as expected, Bator will resign his professorship this fall.</span></p> <p><span>And Professor of Chinese and Central Asian History Joseph F. Fletcher '57, one of the world's leading specialists on inner Asia, died after a long battle with cancer.</span></p> <p><span>Fletcher, who fought to continue teaching despite his illness, was known as an excellent instructor, and won the Levenson Teaching Prize from undergraduates in 1983.  In January 1983, after an extended stay in the hospital, Fletcher returned to his class, Historical Study B-14, \"Empire of the Mongols.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"One thing that happens when you face death, as I did and do, is you discover what your priorities are.  It's important to have fun--lots of us forget that,\" he told his students at the time.  \"In facing my priorities,\" he said, \"I realized I love teaching this course.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "Tap Shannon... | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>T WAS PROBABLY mere coincidence that Rep. James M. Shannon (D-Lawrence) and Lt. Gov. John F. Kerry were wearing identical blue suits and red ties at the Sep. 6 Democratic Senate candidates debate.  But the physical and ideological similarities between the two are not.  The \"liberal twins\"--as more moderate contender Michael J. Connolly, the secretary of state, calls them--are both young.  Catholic well-educated, and products of a post-Vietnam War backlash that has led them to impassioned opposition to U.S. military involvement abroad and the nuclear arms race on moral rather than political grounds.</span></p> <p><span>You're not going to find two more liberal pols than John Kerry and Jim Shannon, even in the People's Republic of Massachusetts, and the temptation is to assume they are identical.  Resist it.  Scrape away the often stale liberal rhetoric and the image mongering, and you will find that Jim Shannon deserves and is more qualified to replace Paul E. Tsongas as this state's junior senator.</span></p> <p><span>Not only does the 32-year-old Shannon have more Washington experience than Kerry, whose lieutenant governor post serves as little more than a political stepping-stone, but he has managed to reach an influential post on the House Ways and Means Committee without compromising his liberal voting record.  Shannon, only 32 years old and finishing only his third term representing the Fifth District north of Boston, has already mastered the art of getting things done.  He is a liberal with clout, and should continue to be effective in stopping and reversing the arms race and pushing for meaningful negotiations with the Soviet Union.  A non-interventionist whose rhetoric occasionally borders on the isolationist, Shannon will nonetheless provide a strong opposition to President Reagan's tendency toward military adventurism.</span></p> <p><span>Shannon has been among the strongest opponents to Reaganomics in the House, resisting the flow of Democrats votes to the Republican side in the passage of Reagan's 1981 budget and massive three-year tax cut.  Voting in Congress, of course, is more than the pulling of a lever, and we think Shannon, an instant protegee of Speaker of the House Rep. Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill (D-Cambridge), will prove that he is more than a litmus-test liberal.</span></p> <p><span>To do this, Shannon will first have to catch up to front-runner Kerry, who holds a narrow lead in the polls, a lead due largely to the fact that just two years ago he ran a statewide campaign for lieutenant governor.  Kerry, whose main political asset at this point is his high recognition, has persistently attempted, often unfairly, to undercut Shannon's record and has continued to reach for the moral high ground, a spot for which he is not well suited.</span></p> <p><span>The biggest story of the summer's campaigning has been sniping over a $14 million tax break this spring put through the House Ways and Means Committee to a Springfield insurance company that had previously donated $6,000 to Shannon's senate campaign.  According to local press reports--denied by Kerry--the Kerry campaign actively peddled the story to area media and then volunteered that he was shocked and astounded by the revelations.  It was perhaps poetic justice that an executive of the company revealed that Kerry had approached the same insurance firm for campaign donations, only to be turned down.</span></p> <p><span>It is symptomatic of Kerry's campaign that even his safest proclamations of the liberal would of morality and care should sound hollow.  He has yet to adequately convince voters that he has evolved from his brash days as leader of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, when he gained a reputation among many as a hollow; unconvincing activist.</span></p> <p><span>Neither of the other two contenders have shown they have much to offer.  David M. Bartley, a university president after leaving the speakership of the Massachusetts House, has been of a disappointment, and his sudden pledge to oppose any tax increases reeks of the worst Reaganaut pandering.  Connolly is distinctive only in that his appearance and gestures bear a remote resemblance to those of Bill Murray.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Unconventional Warfare | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><i>\"This contract was really stark.  The images portrayed of Republican and of our ACORN members curry over to real lives.  The Republicans live high off the hog and we have to grovel in the dirt and scrape by ACORN people are the spirit of America--we are the wind blowing through the flaps of the flags and tents.\"</i></span></p> <p><span><b>E</b>LENA HANGGI, president of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), is describing the protests--and the protestors--her organization led at last month's Republican convention in Dallas.  Almost for gotten in a month's worth of Mondale glitches and media forums about Reagan and religion, and soon likely to be forgotten altogether, the protests were expressive of much that is right and wrong with us.</span></p> <p><span>Chanting \"Ronald Reagan He's No Good.  Send Him Back To Hollywood,\" almost a thousand people camped out along Dallas' Trinity River to protest the Republican's policies.  The protests organized by ACORN--a national group of neighborhood groups in poor areas--were not the only shows in town:  the protest veterans of the 60s, the Yippies, staged their pot smoke-ins; the punks did their \"Rock Against Reagan\" concert (chanting \"Eat the Rich\" and \"Fuck Off and Die\" when the Republican delegates came streaming out of the convention center nearby, battling to be heard over a loud school band hired on short notice by the Republicans); and the crazies did their War Chest Tour--walking around the city, splashing the 'facades of capitalism' such as banks and multinational corporate headquarters, with red paint.</span></p> <p><span>Even with all this, there was no violence as there was in San Francisco, and there were not nearly as many protestors as at the March On Washington a year earlier.  But there was something special here--all the more telling because of the lack of attention it received.  A thousand poor people came in from all over the country to broil for three days in the hot Texas sun--where temperatures reached upwards of 110 degrees--simply to exercise their First Amendment freedom, to express the injuries and wrongs that had been done to them by the Reagan regime.</span></p> <p><span>ACORN's Tent City was impressive; right by the major highway, Republican delegates coming in from the airport couldn't fail to notice the gospel tents, huge \"Reagan-buster\" signs, and people milling about from the ice-machines to the shade and back.  The heat was so bad, that some of the older people from other parts of the country, not used to Texas heat, had medical problems.  But there were not many of them, and the others who were well continued to chant; \"We're Fired Up, We're Going to Dump the Chump.\"</span></p> <p><span>Acorn members ignored media attempts to sensationalize the Tent City by focusing on the handful of abrasive Yippies camping nearby.  And they refused to be tempted to air-conditioned houses by the middle-class Yuppies who left the Tent City after experiencing a little discomfort.  Calling themselves \"Peacekeepers\" because they held seminars on how to remain nonviolent and protect their bodies when attacked by the police, these well-to-do allies field suit to have the City immediately provide another campsite with shade trees and air conditioned first aid vehicles.  Dallas' responsibility to protect First Amendment rights only extends so far, the judge ruled.</span></p> <p><span>Although the press was out in force for the Tent City, and most of them did capture ACORN's message that Reagan had his own version of a \"War on Poverty\", they were drawn largely to the more easily sensationalized small fringe groups also camping at Tent City.  ACORN president Hanggi, who came from Arkansas with her husband and daughter, said that in talking to the media, \"What I had to deal with was their perception of what a protest rally was.\"  In the 60's and early 70's, she said, most of the anti-war rallies were white middle-class people, and if \"you did not have 100,000 people stowed away somewhere, then it didn't mean anything.  But as the issues change, so should the perception of a protest rally change.\"</span></p> <p><span>Many press reports highlighted what was considered to be the low numbers of protestors.  A long <i>Washington Post</i> article claimed the Tent City proved that the era of large protest demonstrations was over, prompting one participant to say:  \"That reporter must not have been at the same Tent City I was at.\"  Hanggi and others shrugged off those media reports, saying the reporters just don't understand the different realities of working in a poor people's movement, as opposed to the anti-war protests.  Hanggi said:  \"The difference is that we're working on different issues, such as economic ones, and we do protest rallies every day, every month, every year to create social change.  The issues have changed, the protest has changed.  The media are the ones behind the times.\"</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the biases in the press are understandable.  After all, at the Tent City the temperature was about 110 degrees all three days and dust settled over everything.  Air conditioning at the Republican convention made the place pleasantly chilly--some delegates even protested that the hall was too cold.  The press was treated to free food, such as shrimp salad lunches and drinks by the GOP, while they could buy a plate of rice and beans at Tent City.  The Republicans provided free phones, typewriters, tv's and work areas, while there was a bank of pay phones atop a steep hill at Tent City.</span></p> <p><span>The Tent City did not allow any alcohol in the area, to make sure the press did not sensationalize the protest as a bunch of drunken revelers.  But the first Republican convention official I dealt with to get my press credentials was drinking a beer at 11 a.m. while a worker behind him was refilling the beer freezer.  The beer of course, was COORS, produced by the right-wing, union-busting, Reagan buddy:  Joseph Coors.</span></p> <p><span><b>D</b>ALLAS--embroiled in growing racial conflict between geographically and economically divided whites and minorities; ruled in the city chambers by a group of patronizing rich white men who seek to hide facts such as one-third of adult Black men in the city are unemployed; ruled in the streets by police draped in the \"shoot first\" cowboy image, an image Ronald Reagan helped to foster in his Western movies--with all this, is a more appropriate symbol of what Republicans have been doing to this country than the booming business center they had wanted to show off.</span></p> <p><span>Months before the Tent City opened, ACORN had to fight with the city of Dallas, a racially segregated city with heaps of poverty in the minority and immigrant sections.  The glitzy shiny tower facade of business and oil money was sparkling for the Republican delegates, while the 45 percent minority population was on the verge of calling an all out was on the rich whites who control the city.</span></p> <p><span>Dallas' business community had been gearing up for the convention as a showcase in which to present the beauty and attractiveness of the city to the rest of the country.  Dallas deserved to be a first-class city, not a regional outpost, and here was its big chance.  The city promised the citizens that no public money would be spent on the convention costs would be met through private sources, meaning wealthy Texas REpublicans, oil companies, a local newspaper, and others.  Throughout the downtown area, a logo welcoming the Republicans to Dallas (an elephant inside a large \"D\" for Dallas) was displayed on all storefront windows and flags with the logo flapped next to American flags from streetlight.  Cab drivers were brought together at a big meeting and told that if they presented Dallas in a good light to their fares, they and Dallas would get more business in the future.</span></p> <p><span>There was no way Dallas was going to let the week-long advertisement opportunity be marred by unpredictable events.  So, when the Alliance For Justice (the national coalition spearheaded by ACORN to plan the Tent City) applied for a permit for a downtown campsite, the city granted one at a park a full 18 miles away from the Republican Convention Center.</span></p> <p><span>After a lawsuit and a series of tough direct actions by ACORN members, the city settled out of court for a campsite a mile from the Convention Center, beside the major highway used by delegates coming from the airport to Dallas.  In addition, the city agreed to set up showers, toilets, and running water for the campers.  Not quite the fancy Anatole Hotel, but bearable.</span></p> <p><span>Dallas still contrived to separate all protest from the delegates.  Delegates were asked not to walk to the convention center, but to take special buses because there was supposedly no way to guarantee safety.  And the designated \"special event area\" for ACORN's Monday morning rally at the convention center was out of night of the delegates going in.  Behind a grassy knoll, in back of large trees, surrounded by fences, and watched by police on horses, the ACORN rally seemed to take place in a cage.  The only moment of police-protestor confrontation for ACORN members took place when they sidestepped a line of police with readied batons to reach the delegate entrance.</span></p> <p><span>But Dallas officials had played up the police and security precautions they were taking for weeks before the convention, receiving extensive local press coverage.  In the wake of San Francisco's confrontations, much of the local population was scared off by rumored \"shoot to kill\" police orders.  Blacks and Hispanics in Texas especially feared the Dallas police's reputation for a \"shoot first ask questions later\" behavior against minorities.  One officer had just beer fired from the force, but community leaders said the firing was merely a cover-up to deflect criticism.  And the week of the convention, police responded to minority criticism by saying:  Of course minorities are shot by police more often; they shoot at us more often than others.</span></p> <p><span>One white city councilman urged citizen to get involved in the shooting; he boasted of having participated in the shooting of two men he said were robbing a store.  A coalition of Hispanic groups, upset by his insensitive incitement of citizens to shoot others, announced they would collect signatures to force a recall election.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile Blacks condemned the Republican convention for not awarding any contracts to minority-owned businesses.  A couple of days before the Republican Convention began, on a tour of the Convention Center with Republican fat cats the organizer of the Republican Convention came across a meeting including some city councilors.  Spotting the convention organizer in the back of the room, a Black city councilman interrupted the session to challenge him on the minority contracting issue.  In front of the media, the convention organizer took up the usual patronizing attitude, saying he was sorry the city councilman could not see things the way they really are.</span></p> <p><span>Whites and Blacks on the city council feuded for weeks before the convention, with Blacks harshly criticizing police and city policies set by the white majority.  In the bitter name-calling, some whites on the council complained that the Black city councilors were not fit for the job.  The Black community responded to this by saying that white city leaders better back off, and not try to tell Blacks who their elected leaders should be.</span></p> <p><span>After fighting with the city for a campsite, unsure of the direction the racial sparring would take, ACORN went ahead with plans to set up the Tent City, First, two massive gospel revival tents went up at the corner of the newly formed \"Martin Luther King\" and John J. Lewis streets.  The Saturday afternoon before the Republicans came into town, ACORN held its own national convention.</span></p> <p><span>There, Hanggi told the crowd that they were in Texas not only to get together and chant about how bad Reagan was, but to do some serious work.  Everybody at the Tent City, along with another hundred allies, boarded a fleet of buses and vans Sunday morning and spread out over the poor neighborhoods of Dallas.  Going door to door in groups of two along carefully mapped out \"turfs\", the Tent City dwellers registered over 12,000 new voters in Dallas.  The largest single-day voter registration drive in the history of Texas was not short-lived either.  Back at camp, there was great enthusiasm when Hanggi asked:  \"Will we be at the welfare offices?  \"Yes,\" cried the crowed.  \"Will we be at the shopping counters?  Will we be at the schools registering 18 year-olds?  Will we go door to door to door to door in our neighborhoods?\" Yes.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>ancy Riggings, an older, quiet, poor Black woman from Fort Worth had a horrible Sunday.  She had been unable to register a single voter in three hours because everyone along her turf had already registered.  She was lost in an unfamiliar part of Dallas for two hours before an ACORN search party managed to rescue her from the heat.</span></p> <p><span>Still, she exemplified the spirit of the Tent City dwellers who never started bitching because it was hot, or because the food arrived two hours late, or because there were so many things to bitch at.  Without having accomplished anything in five hours on the streets, she was looking forward to hearing Jesse Jackson speak at the Tent City that night.  He cancelled however, and she was disappointed.  Then, that night at the interfaith service, she shocked me when she learned over to me and said:  \"I'm going to take some of those voter registration cards to where I work.\"</span></p> <p><span>The real story, then, is about Nancy Riggings from Fort Worth.  Or Nancy Riggins the maid from Chicago.  Or Nancy Riggins the bed pan cleaner in Little Rock.  Or Nancy Riggins the single unemployed mother in a Roxbury.  Or Nancy Riggins the illegal immigrant from Mexico who works in the factory for a buck and a half an hour.</span></p> <p><span>The story is not about the middle-class \"peacekeepers\" who forget Nancy Riggins when they \"Rally for Peace and Freedom\" and forget \"Jobs\".  The story is not about the press who sip their Coors, stuff their face with shrimp, and pronounce the death of protest movements in our time.  The story is not about Republicans who blow into town, spend money, drink, vote on the party platform without bothering to read it over first, and take \"Fritz and Tits\" buttons home as souvenirs.  Nor is the story about young middle-class students like myself, who are able to take off a few weeks, months, or years to work with poor people while living under the poverty line themselves--though all the time with the knowledge in the back of their mind that they can leave the squalor when they can take it no more.</span></p> <p><span>Instead it is about the Nancy Riggins of this country, who are trapped with low pay, unstable work, and ever pressing needs outrunning their budgets.  They are the ones who have never heard the smug, intellectual argument I have heard so often in this corner of Cambridge--that Mondale is little different than Reagan, and the best thing for a progressive to do is not to vote at all-otherwise one is selling out.  The story is about those who will fight when they can, where they can, whether they succeed fully or not, whether they attract attention or not.  If this portrayal may seem a little romanticized, so be it.  For perhaps romanticism is the stuff that dreams, tent cities, and social change is made of.</span></p>"}

This short note, courteously addressed.  \"Dear Friend of Senator Jackson,' stated that the Senator had originally \"encouraged\" Gardner to run, and was fully behind his assault on the Governor's chair. This endorsement was highly unusual; Henry M. \"Scoop\" Jackson was never one to become overly involved in local election, the more so after his death more than a year ago.</span></p> <p><span>So what was this?  Direct Mail from the Great Beyond?  An exhortation exhumed with Jackson's bodily remains?  Unfortunately, the truth is not quite so tasteful.  Two former members of Jackson's staff saw fit to lend their defunct chief's name and memory to the hard-pressed Gardner, perhaps with the hope of rectifying their unemployment caused by Jackson's untimely demise.  Men of former eras might have been deterred by their awe of the dead; but with luck the Senator's spirit was still a true Democrat at heart.</span></p> <p><span>But besides being a particularly crass example of last-minute vote scrounging, this post-mortem mailing illustrates in funebral glory how far out the process of political endorsement has gone.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE AMERICAN ELECTORAL process has always had a smelly side to it, but in the past, once the deals were cut and the alliances made, hypocrisy was kept as straightforward as possible:  an endorsement, no matter how distasteful the spirit in which it was made, simply indicated the support of some key constituency.</span></p> <p><span>Things don't work that way anymore.  The Jackson example is only the latest in a new phenomenon-the divorce of the appearance and the reality of political power.  The people doing the endorsing--and the endorsements themselves--increasingly have nothing to do with the substance of political campaigns.</span></p> <p><span>The most discussed aspect of modern American politics has been the role of the media in deciding the track results.  Endorsements are no longer the mere flags of factions as they arrayed in electoral battle, with unions as the significant exception. Modern day endorsements are much more ice PBS-TV, split into its pecuniary and public parts:  the program itself, and the sponsors.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike PBS, however, both sides want to keep the financial aid, mostly from the burgeoning number of political action committees, a secret.  No candidate steps proudly forward to announce that he has won the coveted support of the Committee for Vested Interests or the Association for Religious Intolerance; and the furthest degree of help accepted is another $5,000 dollars, thank you.</span></p> <p><span>While the pecuniary part of campaigns is kept under wraps, the public part has come to dwell on anything but politics.  Concurrent with the rise of political action committees has come the practice of celebrity politics.  Remember the rock'n'roll politics of the 1980 campaign, where musicians like the Gregg Allman Band, Linda Ronstadt, and Willie Nelson lent their public image for limited political exploitation?  This year Ronald Reagan has been the most effective practitioner of this ruse, craftily manipulating the names and photos of Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen and others for his own re-election.</span></p> <p><span>These celebrities are politically useful not because an endorsement from Boy George will away any culture Club fanatic to vote Republican (most of them are too young to vote anyway), but for associations of youth, glamour, and vitality that they bring.  Reagan, the Acting President, realizes that he does not need the personal OK of a superstar to shine from his or her reflected charisma.  Reagan's hyper-publicized photo with God's Gift to the Sequin Industry was seen by more potential voters than the Republican National convention, and was a lot easier on the eyes.  One would almost suspect that the blue and gold officer's jacket and aviator's glasses were a secret gift to the tax-free Nancy d. Reagan Wardrobe Fund, in order to promote militarism among the young.</span></p> <p><span>The affable Reagan, of course, doesn't really need this a political help; it is Walter Mondale who could use some help from the Jacksons, but he isn't getting it.  Mondale has an anti-charisma, a portable entropy that drains the sparkle of those sharing his podium.  The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson is the notable exception, which perhaps explains why the Mondale campaign so cravenly sought his endorsement.  But even with the redoubtable Reverend on his side.  Mondale cannot project the appeal he needs, and his supporters have not managed to find enough celebrities to fill the void--one reason for his long gap in the polls.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>O ONE had ever doubted the importance of good looks and a smoothe style to political success, but the emphasis on this to the exclusion of other qualities is getting ridiculous--as the Senate campaign is Washington reminds us.  Here, no movie star or pop singer was good enough--this time the consultants had to reach into the grave, literally.  It is hardly surprising that a candidate might look wistfully to the towering giants of bygone eras; Jackson was the only statesman my state has generated, a man respected in both Washingtons.  Since he dies, several communities in Washington State have been vying to see which can name the most things after him.</span></p> <p><span>And if anyone needs the extra lustre Jackson's name carries, it is Gardner.  A man who has admitted to reporters that he began his campaign horribly, lacking the name recognition of his opponent Jim McDermott, Gardner has been forced to run a media-heavy campaign financed largely by his limited personal wealth.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson's \"Endorsement From the Grave\" is the logical extension of the gap between appearance and the reality.  Jackson, were he alive today, might well have supported Gardner's candidacy.  Then again, he might not have.  Jackson cannot vote for Gardner; his alleged posthumous support carries no weight.  However, by leeching part of the public's respect for Jackson, by trying to seize a piece of Jackson's image and make it his own, Gardner has displayed just how far the image has come in its long-standing battle with substance in our political process.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Time to Learn a Bitter Lesson | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>M</b>ORE THAN a week later, the suicide car-bomb that blasted the U.S. embassy in Lebanon continues to send a message far beyond, the rattled windows of Beirut.  It has become clear that our government is incapable of learning from the past, and that the present Administration's efforts against terrorism have done little more than provide a speech topic for high officials.</span></p> <p><span>Despite President Reagan's assertions to the contrary, the lapses in security which let a crazed fanatic gun his bomb-laden van to the front entrance of the embassy remain nothing short of shocking.</span></p> <p><span>Eight weeks ago, the threats against American personnel were still coming, and the fledgling Lebanese government had yet to prove itself able to guarantee order.  But the State Department decided anyway that the newly relocated embassy was somehow safe enough, and withdrew the 80-man Marine contingent armed with the heavy weapons that could have stopped the car-terrorist.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, the Marines were withdrawn long before the embassy had been made secure.  Officials knew that shatter-resistant windows, reinforced blast walls, earthen berms, and even simple gates were crucial to containing terrorist attacks.  But they allowed the embassy personnel to move in before protective devices had been completely installed.  Only a few easily negotiated concrete barriers stood between the killer-car and the embassy.</span></p> <p><span>Security procedures were so lax that the terrorist van was already far past local Phalangist militiamen before they realized something was wrong and started to shoot.  Only the chance presence of the British ambassador and his bodyguards, who shot the driver before he could enter the building's garage, saved the embassy from total destruction.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE LACK OF attention to security extended right to Washington.  A Defense Intelligence.  Agency report showing that the new embassy was unsafe was not distributed to senior State Department officials until after the bombing--even though the report had been completed at least a week before.</span></p> <p><span>Even now, days after the bombing, diplomatic security in Lebanon remains inadequate.  The old embassy, which still has U.S. personnel and government papers, is guarded by sleeping Lebanese soldiers.  An alleyway leading to its front entrance has been left totally open, according to news reports.</span></p> <p><span>Under ordinary Lebanese circumstances, such lapses would border on the criminally negligent.  Yet the car-attack was not the first, but the third such strike against American installations in Beirut--following the unforgottably tragic destruction of the U.S. embassy 17 months ago and the more recent Marine compound bombing which killed 241 Americans.</span></p> <p><span>It is unconscionable that those incidents haven't led to supertight security.  As Robert S. Dillon, former ambassador to Lebanon, said of the car attack:  \"When I saw the TV this morning, I asked, 'How could it happen again?'\"</span></p> <p><span>The administration, eager to cover itself as the Presidential election draws near, has tried to explain away the terrorist success, shrugging its shoulders and blaming the Carter administration, even comparing the delays in security construction to problems people have when they redo their kitchens.  Only infilitration of terrorist sects can stop their attacks, Reagan said, and suggested two days ago that the real fault lies with \"the near destruction of our intelligence capability\" in the years before his administration.</span></p> <p><span>One would hope that Reagan understands the difference between kitchens and embassies, particularly when those embassies have been bombed repeatedly.  Fatalism will not prevent terrorists from striking again.  Neither will blaming Carter, who actually increased the intelligence budget after it had been slashed under Republican administrations.</span></p> <p><span>In any case, the quality of intelligence really isn't the issue--any high school student who watches the news could tell you that Lebanon is a dangerous place.  The real issue is the lack of interdepartmental coordination, inattention to security detail, and general absence of common sense revealed by the most recent attack.  Couldn't just a few good Marines armed with some sort of anti-tank weapon have prevented the suicide car from getting anywhere near the embassy?</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>OT ONLY must our government beef up security, it needs also to address the question of retaliation, because an undeterred criminal will strike again.  We have yet to deter or punish anyone, despite our brave words that we would avenge our dead.  After last year's Marine bombing, the U.S.A promised to \"respond to this criminal act.\"  Nothing ever happened, even though Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger '38 later said the bombing was executed with the \"sponsorship, knowledge, and authority of the Syrian government.\"</span></p> <p><span>Of course, one must hesitate before striking out to avoid injuring innocents.  And in the case of Islamic Holy War, which has claimed responsibility for the past three attacks on American installations, it has apparently been impossible to ascertain its exact nature and membership.  But, according to <i>The New York Times,</i> intelligence officials worldwide almost all agree that the Holy War gang has major links to the Iranian and Syrian governments, which have the most to gain from humiliating the America.  Surely the United States has the capability to make life unpleasant for these two regimes, as they have so often done for us.</span></p> <p><span>Without concrete proof of guilt, both world opinion and Americans' own moral sense would make overt military action.  Yet increasing support to their enemies (such as Iraq, which is bogged down in war with Iran) would finally make Iran and Syria understand the costs of sponsoring or aiding terrorist attacks.  Certainly, such action needs to be weighed against our other geopolitical interests in the area.  But doing nothing would only show weakness and invite more attacks against Americans.</span></p> <p><span>Another step the U.S. could take to show true concern about stopping terrorism would be to limit its own terrorist acts in Central America.  The CIA's unsecret secret war against the Nicaraguan regime, a war that has led us to mine Nicaraguan harbors, sponsor cross-border contra raids, and wink at Americans illegally selling their services as mercenaries against the Sandinistas, has made a mockery of our efforts to get other nations to support our efforts for international coordination against terrorism.</span></p> <p><span>The Administration justifies its own terrorism mainly by arguing that the Nicaraguan regime, because of its quasi-totalitarian nature, is illegitamate and a threat to our security.  But if we are to preach the principle of national self-determination and the need to ensure civilized behavior, we cannot do it arbitrarily.  We cannot mine harbors in one section of the world because we dislike one nation's regime, and then express outrage when our embassies are bombed in a different regime someone else happens to dislike.</span></p> <p><span>As the attack on our embassy makes abundantly clear, we sorely need an effective and consistent approach to combatting terrorism, from the nitty-gritty of improving diplomatic security all the way to punishing those responsible for terrorism and even restraining ourselves from engaging in terrorist attacks.  Such a policy may seem difficult, costly, and at times apparently against our short-term interest.  But in a world of proliferating destructive technology, where fanatics seem ever ready to sacrifice their lives for some obscure cause, we may have no choice.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Harvard and Nicaragua | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As the Reagan administration carries out a rhetorical, and arguably an actual, war against Nicaragua, an group of Harvard faculty members who have visited the country is publicly challenging the Administration's portrayal of and policies towards the small Central American nation.</span></p> <p><span>Far from being the totalitarian state depicted by State Department spokesmen, these professors and administrators describe Nicaragua as a beleaguered country engaged in a noble experiment but threatened by U.S. backed invaders.  Should Nicaragua be forced to fight for its survival, the professors say, it may well become a military state--out of necessity, not out of ideological preference.</span></p> <p><span>These Harvard personnel have visited Central America in the past year as members of a group called the Faculty for Human Rights in El Salvador and Central America.  The non-profit, California-based organization consists of faculty members in universities across the country who are concerned with human rights and U.S. policy in the region.  Among its directors are Thomas Professor of divinity Harvey G. Cox Jr. and Bliss Professor of Latin American History and Economics John Womack Jr. '59.</span></p> <p><span>\"The whole idea is to involve Americans who are of some influence, direct or indirect,\" says Professor of Law Henry J. Steiner '51, a participant in this June's trip.  \"The goal is to become more vocal.\"</span></p> <p><span>The human rights organization has sent four fact-finding trips to Central America in the past two years.  The trips include five-day stays in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras and a series of interviews with both pro and anti-government groups.</span></p> <p><span>The visitors, who pay their own way, meet with members of the government, military, civil rights groups, political prisoners and members for the church and the opposition press.</span></p> <p><span>Each trip drafts a report of its findings, which it sends to Congress, national newspapers and academics.  The professors involved do no consulting for any government.</span></p> <p><span>Almost all of the Harvard representatives have returned to the University from Central America voicing opposition to the Administration's policy of providing money and training to the \"contras,\" who seek to overthrow the five-year-old Sandinista regime.</span></p> <p><span>\"We have no business telling a country how to run itself, what kind of government or economy to have,' says Dr. Barry M. Lester, assistant professor of pediatrics at the Medical School who travelled to Nicaragua on the same trip as Steiner.</span></p> <p><span><b>Henry Steiner</b></span></p> <p><span>Steiner, who teaches a course on international human rights, brims with indignation towards U.S. policy in Central America.  After visiting the region this June, he describes.  Nicaragua as a country \"attempting a deep social transformation that could go in a number of directions.  One is towards a humane, participatory and inventive society the other towards a one party, tightly controlled state.</span></p> <p><span>\"Our military support for the 'contras' is an abomination,\" Steiner says, adding that \"not only does it violate the principles of international law but it is forcing the regime ever more in the direction we accuse it of taking.\"</span></p> <p><span>Administration critics of the Sandinista regime have long concentrated on its repressive side Hardliners in Washington have pointed to the absence of election and the frequent silencing of dissidents in the press and the church.</span></p> <p><span>While Steiner concedes that the Sandinistas have been oversensitive to domestic criticism he seeks to put it in perspective.  He compares the invasion of Nicaragua by 10,000 rebels to an attack on the United States by a million hostile troops.  Some suppression of civil liberties is inevitable, he says.</span></p> <p><span>But if the Administration is truly concerned for human rights, Steiner adds, then it is backing the wrong guys.  On the June trip, the faculty group amassed information on massacres and torture committed by the \"contras\" on the civilian population.  \"No one could ever blame the Sandinistas for some of the things the 'contras' have done,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>\"However one views the Sandinista record, we are not responsible for it.  But we are complicit with what the 'contras' are doing,\" Steiner adds.  \"Let's get our human rights priorities straight.\"</span></p> <p><span>After returning to the States, Steiner wrote to 22 congressmen and leading newspapers about his findings in Nicaragua--over and above the group's letter--and criticized current U.S. policy.  Along with the letter he sent a manual that he obtained in Nicaragua.  The book let presented in cartoon form instructions on how to destroy farms and burn books, among other acts of sabotage.  According to Steiner, sources in Nicaragua said the manual could be traced to the CIA.</span></p> <p><span>Steiner says, he plans no further political activism--but he will raise the issue of U.S. policy in Nicaragua in his class and in the law school human rights program, of which he is an organizer.</span></p> <p><span><b>Noel McGinn</b></span></p> <p><span>For Education School Professor Noel F. McGinn, his trip to Nicaragua in August 1983 with the Faculty Committee on Human Rights was not his first.  Born in Panama, the 49-year-old McGinn has worked for years on education throughout Latin America. In 1978, on a literacy project for the Agency for International Development, he visited Nicaragua and witnessed the last days of the Somoza regime.</span></p> <p><span>After returning from a two-year stint in Mexico in 1981.  McGinn discovered that attitudes in the U.S. towards the Sandinistas had changed drastically.  Civil war had flared up again in El Salvador, and the U.S. was coming down hard on the Sandinistas for lending support to the Salvadoran rebels.</span></p> <p><span>Two years later, when organizers of the Faculty on Human Rights approached McGinn about a trip to Nicaragua, he jumped at the opportunity.</span></p> <p><span>What he found was a country much changed from the Somoza days.  This time, McGinn says, he witnessed wide-spread enthusiasm on the part of the people.  \"It was clear that the people in the street were supportive,\" he says.  \"Now they could get health and educational services.  The government was offering political participation and it appeared very democratic.\"</span></p> <p><span>Like many of his colleagues, McGinn rejects the Administration's explanation of Central American instability. Rather than laying the blame on Cuban and Soviet penetration.  McGinn sees the problem as one rooted in centuries of poverty and injustice.  Not does he regard the analogy with Cuba as a particularly valid one.</span></p> <p><span>\"The difference between Nicaragua and Cuba is that in Nicaragua there are six or so leaders, while Castro did it all on his own,\" he says.  \"Nicaragua was a popular uprising with middle-class support. It began with a junta with four priests and a conservative businessman.\"</span></p> <p><span>But U.S. policies may force Nicaragua along the Cuban route.  McGinn says.  He agrees with Steiner that armed pressure against the country will militarize the Sandinistas further and push them towards heightened internal controls.  \"If we attack Nicaragua we will eliminate loyal opposition in the country.  The Sandinistas will necessarily centralize and rule out any opposition.\"</span></p> <p><span>McGinn, who teaches two courses on education at the Ed School and is a fellow at the Harvard Institute of International Development, will host a group of university presidents from four Central American countries who are visiting Harvard this week.  The group will speak to a public forum at the Kennedy School on the role of the effects of war on their universities.</span></p> <p><span><b>Frederick Snyder</b></span></p> <p><span>Like McGinn, Assistant Dean of the Law School Frederick E. Snyder brought long academic involvement with Latin America to his trip to El Salvador last January.  A lecturer on Latin American law, the 40-year-old Snyder teaches a course called \"Law, Politics and Revolution in Latin America\" and has published articles on the same subject.</span></p> <p><span>Last October he organized the visit of a group of Nicaraguan officials coming to Harvard to study electoral law and political parties, witnessing first-hand the Reagan Administration's hostility to Nicaragua as the State Department delayed the granting of visas to members of the group and pushed back the date of their arrival.</span></p> <p><span>The Faculty on Human Rights wrote to Snyder inviting him to Central America.  When he arrived in El Salvador he found the state of human rights deplorable.  The bulk of the problem was not, as Washington repeatedly claimed, leftist guerrillas gunning down innocent civilians.</span></p> <p><span>Rather, he says, the culprits were death squads and paramilitary organizations that operated with the tacit, if not overt, support of the U.S. trained army.  Salvadoran was a minimum of human rights violations to be expected in a civil war.</span></p> <p><span>\"Human rights violations were largely attributable to death squads,\" says Snyder, echoing the opinion of members of the Salvadoran church and human rights organizations.  \"These squads operated with the consent and even participation of the military.  Their violations far out-weigh the real but minimal number of incidents of civil violence perpetrated by the insurgents.\"</span></p> <p><span>At the moment, Snyder is waiting to see if Nicaragua will hold national elections in November as scheduled.  He hopes to attend as an independent observer along with a group of Boston lawyers.</span></p> <p><span><b>Barry Lester</b></span></p> <p><span>Dr. Barry M. Lester, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical school, travelled to Nicaragua and El Salvador in the June group as the token physician at the request of Womack.</span></p> <p><span>Lester, 3\" a specialist on the effect of nutrition on childhood development, spent two years in the early \"0s working in Guatemala at the Institute of Nutrition for Central America and Panama.</span></p> <p><span>Once in Central America.  Lester says, he frequently left the group and showed up unannounced at local health care facilities.  In Nicaragua, he observed an impressive commitment to health care on the part of the Sandinistas and tremendous improvement against polio, typhoid and a host of childhood diseases.</span></p> <p><span>\"What makes Nicaragua unique in the region is that in there human beings are treated as a valuable resource.  The priorities of the Nicaraguan government are related to issues of health and education,\" says Lester.</span></p> <p><span>This contrasts with El Salvador, Lester says, where all health supplies go to the military, while civilians receive poor care.</span></p> <p><span>He claims that the armed forces automatically divert all foreign donations of medical supplies in professionals suspected of treating or sympathizing with the rebels have been killed.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Dallas | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>To the Editors of the Crimson:</span></p> <p><span>As a lifelong citizen of Dallas and as a Mexican-American, I feel I must respond to the distorted attack leveled upon my hometown by your \"Unconventional Warfare\" column of September 19.  In his vehement efforts to criticize the Reagan Administration and the Republican Party, Mark Feinberg has slandered the city of Dallas and its residents, without reason or evidence.</span></p> <p><span>Mr. Feinberg's portrayal of Dallas as a city at the racial breaking point is, quite simply, not true.  To say that Dallas minorities were \"on the verge of calling an all out war on the rich whites who control the city\" is not only grossly inaccurate, it is, in my opinion, the most irresponsible and reprehensible statement I have seen in any newspaper in this (or any) year.  Dallas\" minorities have never felt compelled to resort to violent protests to achieve their demands; through hard work and cooperation, the people of Dallas have achieved a measure of racial harmony that would be the envy of many cities--including Boston.  This is not to say that there is no racism in Dallas, but Mr. Feinberg's portrayal of Dallas as a segregated hotbed of racial turmoil is entirely false.  As a member of Dallas minority community and having lived there for twenty-one years, I think I know more about the subject than Mr. Feinberg (apparently) learned in a week's visit.</span></p> <p><span>Equally reprehensible are Mr. Feinberg's attempts to portray Dallas as a police state.  The city provided the protestors at \"Tent City\" with basic necessities--which, in my opinion, was more than enough.  To suggest or imply that the city should have provided for the protestor's every need, want or comfort is ludicrous.  Dallas had the responsibility to insure only that the protestors be given the opportunity to protest; the federal judge (a Democrat) was obviously correct in ruling that the city had no obligation to further subsidize the protestors.  By providing basic necessities, the city of Dallas donated far more than it was obligated to, in either a legal or a moral sense.  In addition, the police in no way blocked the protestors' access to public areas; the buses provided for delegates were part of a city-wide network established for the convention, and Mr. Feinberg's contention that the protestors could not be seen or heard from the convention center suggests either biased judgement or faulty eyesight.</span></p> <p><span>Mr. Feinberg also sharply distorted the issue of police shootings in Dallas.  I'd like to know the names of those community leaders who called the dismissal of one officer a \"cover-up\"; as with the rest of this column, Mr. Feinberg is long on opinion and woefully short on facts.  In fact, two weeks after the convention, after the media spotlight had ended, the Dallas police chief met with minority leaders to hammer out a more restrictive deadly force policy; a solution which satisfied all parties involved was agreed upon and is now in effect.  That is the way we do things in Dallas.  Rather than confrontation, Dallasites seek negotiation; rather than violence, we prefer cooperation.</span></p> <p><span>Through his column, Mr. Feinberg has insulted virtually all groups in Dallas.  His portrayal of the city's leadership as \"patronizing rich white men\" insults men and women who have worked virtually all their lives to make Dallas a better city.  The leaders of Dallas have done infinitely more for their city than Mr. Feinberg will ever do for anyone, save maybe himself.  His portrayal of the Dallas police force as a group of trigger-happy rednecks is an insult to the hundreds of fine men and women of all races who have served their city with pride and honor.  I find particularly galling the implication that Dallas' minorities are overwhelmingly poor.  I consider this extremely insulting, not only to myself and my family, but also to thousands of Black and Hispanic Dallasites who have worked hard to establish a better life for themselves.</span></p> <p><span>In one area, Mr. Feinberg's column was somewhat accurate, that being the unfortunate and ridiculous comments made by some members of the Dallas City Council.  However, Mr. Feinberg implicates the white members while absolving the Black members.  In my opinion, there are both white and Black members of the Council that are not fit for the job.  Incompetence has been, in this case, truly an equal opportunity employer.</span></p> <p><span>I would encourage Mr. Feinberg to return to Dallas:  I would be glad to show him my city:  As the convention hoopla has long since passed, I think Mr. Feinberg would find a city far different from the one he portrayed in his column.  As a city, Dallas is far from perfect, but it is filled with people who stick together and work hard to solve its problems.  Had Mr. Feinberg interviewed any Dallasites, be they wealthy executives or ordinary citizens or even local ACORN members, he would have found a commitment and a sense of optimism which is so sorely lacking in so many American cities.  Glitter, money or image do not make a city--people do.  It is the people of Dallas and their spirit that make it, for me, one of the best cities anywhere.  The people of Dallas and their spirit that make it, for me, one of the best cities anywhere.  The people of Dallas certainly do not deserve the invective and falsities which Mr. Feinberg has chosen to cast upon them.</span></p> <p><span>Responsible, fair and accurate reporting is the least that can be expected from a major college newspaper.  Mr. Feinberg's column met none of these standards.  I can only hope that better reporting and better research on the part of Mr. Feinberg, will prevent such a journalistic travesty, from happening again. John P. Leon '85</span></p>"}
{"title": "Let's Get Radical | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>M</b>ARTIN S. FELDSTEIN '61, of all people, understands the importance of criticism.  The former economic adviser to the President was lambasted by Administration officials last winter when he called Reagan's tax policies into question, but he stood his ground.  You can't balance the budget without raising taxes, he insisted.  It apparently wasn't Reagan's view.</span></p> <p><span>So when Feldstein, returning to Harvard to oversee Social Analysis 10, \"Principles of Economics,\" decided to abolish the more than decade-long tradition of radical sections in that course, students and faculty alike were understandably upset.  Four hundred students--close to half the class' enrollment--signed petitions last week asking for the reinstatement of the sections, and organizers are still canvassing.</span></p> <p><span>Ec 10, as the course is more widely known, is an introductory economics course, required by the department.  More important, though, it's also a Core course--one reportedly taken by more than three-quarters of all undergraduates.</span></p> <p><span>The Core curriculum, as set up by former Dean of the Faculty Henry A. Rosovsky, is intended to give undergraduates a broad, interdisciplinary education.  At its best, it is designed to teach <i>ways of thinking</i> and not just knowledge.  Limiting the ways in which students are taught to think about economics, as about any other discipline, runs counter to any traditional concept of a liberal arts education.</span></p> <p><span>\"We're trying to represent the views of the mainstream 95 percent of the economic profession,\" explains head section leaders Lawrence B. Lindsey.  Yet for many students, Ec 10 is the only economics course they will ever take.  How is it counterproductive to teach the other 5 percent, particularly in a year-long survey that covers everything from opportunity cost to international rates of exchange?</span></p> <p><span>Feldstein's primary argument against having radical sections is his claim that students are \"self-selecting\" into ideologically-based classes, creating a damaging homogeneity in the sections.</span></p> <p><span>We question this characterization of the radical sections, since the only attribute students in these sections seem to share is a heightened intellectual curiousity.  What is more troubling, however, is Feldstein's effort to defeat the substantive mission of these sections with questions of procedure.  Ec 10 would benefit from the inclusion of as many alternate economic views as time reasonably allows.  Crucial, however, is some attention to radical or Marxist critique of the mainsteam, neo-classical model.  Currently, this material is covered briefly in the coursewide program, but somewhat seriously only in the radical sections.</span></p> <p><span>We heartily encourage Feldstein to make the material covered in the radical sections an integral part of the coursewide lectures, readings and sections.  This would ensure that the radical economic perspective is included without any of the divisive side effects he so dislikes.  Including several optional evening lectures at the end of the semester--the bone Feldstein has tentatively thrown out to those troubled by his decision--does not meet our definition of \"integral.\" Barring such a commitment to teaching the radical material coursewide, however, it is essential that Feldstein at least retain the optional sections for those students who are eager to learn it.</span></p> <p><span>And by all indications, there are many such students.  Section leaders report that, in the last several years, demand for places in the radical sections has exceeded supply by more than 100 percent.  This despite the fact that the sections carry an additional workloard since students read the Marxist critiques in addition to the regular coursewide assignments.  And according to Assistant Professor of Economics and former head section leader for the course Jeffrey A. Wolcowitz, these students performed slightly above average on the coursewide exams.</span></p> <p><span><b>C</b>LEARLY, there are some faculty concerned with the abruptness and finality with which Feldstein's decision was made.  Economics Department Chairman Jerry R. Green says the radical sections may be reinstated after the departmental review of the course, beginning this fall.  A review of the 114-year-old course probably is, as Green suggests, long overdue.</span></p> <p><span>But the department ought to have planned just such a study when Feldstein first indicated last spring that he would terminate the sections.  Economics faculty charge that Feldstein was \"unavailable\" during the summer and that no one got a chance to voice a counter-opinion.  In any event, the department should have taken more responsibility for what is, after all, the course with the highest enrollment in the College.</span></p>"}

They waited two days more than a game and a half, finally, Canada's Gerry Gray put one in at 25.30 of last night's game to end the scoring drought.</span></p> <p><span>But Gray's goal was not enough, as the Iraqis rallied to tie the game, which ended deadlocked at 1-1.  In Sunday night's Olympic opener.  Norway and Chile played a cautious game for 90 minutes which ended scoreless.</span></p> <p><span>After last night's action, group.  A has four teams tied in the race for a trip to the second round in Los Angeles.  While Norway and Chile danced in Boston.  Qatar held a heavily favored French team to a 2-2 tie to deadlock the tournament in Annapolis.</span></p> <p><span>In group B. Canada and Iraq are tied for second place behind Yugoslavia, which beat Cameroon 2-1 last night in Annapolis.  After a round robin series, two teams from cash division the two groups splitting their time between Massachusetts and Maryland and two more playing all their games on the west coast will move on to the quarter finals Los Angeles next week.</span></p> <p><span>Olympic style soccer is a much more disciplined game than the kind played in North America:  spectators noticed the difference in the cautious play and low scoring of the last two nights.</span></p> <p><span>In the first half, the teams traded possession, with Iraq holding only a slight advantage, causing, for awhile, the most exciting action to come from the Iraqi cheering section.</span></p> <p><span>Hundreds of screaming Iraqi fans donated the crowd, waving flags and pictures of President Saddam Hussein Beating drums and tambourines and blowing horns, the Iraqi throngs greatly outnumbered the three Canadian flags on the opposite side of the stadium.</span></p> <p><span>The second half began faster with both teams exiting the locker room pumped up and ready to plan harder.  At the five minute mark, Canada had the nearest most of the night when Randy Reagan he also from 25 feet out hit the cross her and Gray smashed the rebound into the goalpost.</span></p> <p><span>\"We're really not very far away from becoming a very good team and in this case, we write about a goal post's width away,\" said Canadian Coach Tony Waters.</span></p> <p><span>The bill moved up and down the field with both teams running and tackling hard for the next 20 minutes but neither was able to establish a great advantage and the crowd was beginning to grumble about the lack of scoring.  Then forward Dale Mitchell beat an Iraqi defender, pushed the ball deep into the right corner and chipped a perfect pass to Mike Sweeny on the other side of the net.</span></p> <p><span>Sweeny, who has played with Gray for several years, blocked the ball back to his charging teammate, who booted it into the corner of the net from just outside the penalty box.</span></p> <p><span>The goal was set up by action at the opposite end of the field 30 seconds earlier, when, after beating his man and charging in alone from the left side, Iraq's K.H. Awali tripped and fell just in front of the Canadian goal.</span></p> <p><span>Iraq initially controlled the rebound but was unable to attack because Awali remained injured on the ground offsides in front of the net.  Bottled up in the middle of the field, Iraq lost the ball, with Canada capitalizing on their advantage.</span></p> <p><span>After the goal, Iraq quickly regained their composure and pushed the pace, struggling to regain the advantage.  Iraq had been pressing the middle of Canada's defense all night and with seven minutes left in the game, Hussain Saeed Mohamed slipped between the defense off a free kick, set play and beat Lettieri to tie the game.</span></p> <p><span>The goal was a special one for Mohammed.  Going into the game he and the Iraq coach, Ammoud Baba, shared the country's record for most goals scored in the Olympics but Mohammed's score last night pushed him ahead.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm proud that my player became better than me.  I hope he will get some more goals, that's what I want him to do,\" laughed Baba, who captained the Iraqi team in the 1960 Olympics.</span></p> <p><span>As the clock ran down, both sides played fiercely for the win and with only 1:40 remaining it looked like Canada had won the game, but Gray scooped up a Regan header and slipped the ball into the net.  Seconds earlier Mitchell had been flagged for knocking down Iraq's goalie, causing the score to be disallowed.</span></p> <p><span>After the foul the teams were content to run out the clock and escape with the tie, which gives them one point each in this first qualifying round.</span></p> <p><span>In Sunday night's game Norway clearly dominated the play, but was unable to capitalize on its advantage, settling for a 0-0 tie.</span></p> <p><span>The Norwegians, however, appeared to walk away with their morale boosted, as they were not even scheduled to play in the Olympic tournament after failing to qualify last fall.  But when Czechoslovakia and East Germany joined the Soviet boycott of the Games the Norwegians were invited to represent their division.</span></p> <p><span>The Chileans, on the other hand, are a respected challenger and were expected to dominate first round play, so the tie was somewhat of a disappointment to them.</span></p> <p><span>The young, aggressive Norwegians continually controlled the midfield, sending the ball into the opposing zone time after time.</span></p> <p><span>The Chileans countered, however with a patient, defensive game, holding off the Norwegians.  They were reluctant to be caught upfield and waited for the opportunity that would bring victory.</span></p> <p><span>Although Norway's Leif Seland headed the ball into the net at 36:32 of the first half the score was disallowed by an offensive penalty.  But Seland, the youngest player on the team at 20 years old, later challenged the referee's judgement, saying the call frustrated him.</span></p> <p><span>Eduardo Fourniel, the Chilean goalie, sparkled in the net, tallying 11 saves and warded off defeat numerous times.</span></p> <p><span>It was luck, however, that saved the Chilean team at 20:13 of the first half when Norway's Egil Juhansen's 35-footer from the left side deflected off the cross bar and bounded back into play.</span></p> <p><span>Despite Fourniel's outstanding effort, Norway's coach Roeste Fossen said the goalie was lucky.  \"The reasons we didn't score were our lack of accuracy and aggression.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Chilean coach, despite the tie score, conceded that the Norwegians had outplayed his team.  He said his players have \"a long way to go to gain more experience.\"</span></p> <p><span>Tonight's action will play heavily in determining who in group A goes to Los Angeles.  With all four teams deadlocked in the standings after Sunday's ties, tonight's matches between France and Norway at the stadium and Chile vs. Qatar in Annapolis are pivotal in the tournament.</span></p> <p><span>In Sunday's west coast soccer action, the U.S. team is tied for first place in group D after blanking Costa Rica 3-0 on Sunday.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The ABC's of Ted Koppel's 'Nightline' | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Delivering an address in person will be something of a new experience for today's Class Day Speaker.  Ted Koppel, anchor of ABC's \"Nightline.\"  Five nights a week, Koppel communicates with several million viewers through television.</span></p> <p><span>\"Ted talks to monitors, not people,\" says Tom Shales, the television critic for the Washington Post Koppel likes \"Nightline\"'s style, which places him in Washington or New York, while his far-flung guests appear on large video screens before him.  \"I'm insulated,\" Koppel says.  \"I'm a queen bee connected electronically to everyone else.\"</span></p> <p><span>Koppel says that the format and subjects discussed on \"Nightline\" are appropriate for television because.  \"Television is the bazaar in which we do our shopping.\"  \"It's the place that causes us to make up our mind on everything from jockey shorts to president,\" he adds.</span></p> <p><span>And while \"Nightline\" has yet to devote a half-hour to undergarments, it has addressed everything from the Iran-Iraq war to the beauty of Mt Everest, from the possibility of a nuclear apocalypse to Cabbage Patch dolls.  \"Can you name a subject 'Nightline' hasn't discussed?\"  Koppel asks.</span></p> <p><span>But Koppel denies that the program is meant to be educational.  \"I assume our viewers are intelligent.\"  Koppel says.  \"But like Mark Twain said.  All people are ignorant about some things.'  But to admit that 'Nightline' is an 'educational program' would be to sound its death knell.  Television generally does a pretty lousy job with information and--God forbid--education.\"</span></p> <p><span>But many journalists and occasional guests on \"Nightline\" believe that the show provides an exception to the familiar lament that television news too superficial.  They believe that \"Nightline\" at once both \"entertains <i>and</i> educates,\" says Donald say, the Chief Judge of the 8th Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals, who recently appeared with Koppel on \"Viewpoint,\" a semi-regular \"Nightline\" variation that examines the press.</span></p> <p><span>And these observers credit Koppel with the low's success.  As they discuss Koppel's influence on \"Nightline, they also address \"Nightline's\" influence on Koppel.  Shales perceives a lebrity-like ego.  But others point to Koppel's selflessness which, four years ago, led him to transfer his resignation to ABC News so that he could stay at home while his wife returned to school.  These observers praise the program, even as they question some of its techniques and weaknesses.  Mike Royko, a columnist for the <i>Chicago tribune</i> who has been a guest on \"Nightline,\" says that he felt \"a little uncomfortable\" with the electronic connections.</span></p> <p><span>And Shales says that when he first watched \"Nightline\" four years ago, he thought its em-basis on television monitors \"was ludicrous.\"  Koppel says that \"Nightline's\" style has produced new unwanted \"clones of hundreds of people longs live interviews with TV screens, whether son 'Live at Five' or 'More at Four'.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Bill Lord, the former executive producer of \"Nightline\" and now the executive producer of ABC's \"World News Tonight,\" thinks \"Nightline's\" style is central to its success.  \"Ted doesn't want to be taken in by the guest's personality.  He wants to approach it as the audience does,\" he says.  \"He wants all guests to establish their criminals with the public.\"</span></p> <p><span>Shales too, now thinks that \"Nightline\"'s style makes perfect television sense.  It's easier to fit in on little boxes.  All we need to see is their faces,\" he says.  The style, he continues, enhances the show's strength and its efforts \"to shed a lot of light on a variety of issues.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"It was a brilliant coup to create the show,\" says William Small, the former president of NBC News and former vice president of CBS News who now heads United Press International.</span></p> <p><span>Royko, who occasionally takes a swipe at television news in his column, says that \"Nightline\" is \"informative.\"  A frequent guest on the show.  Alan M. Dershowitz, professor of law, agrees that live television is the best medium for \"Nightline.\"  \"There's a dynamism about bringing controversy to TV,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Without exception, all questioned credit Koppel with the show's success.  \"Ted Koppel is 'Nightline,'\" says Don Hewitt, the executive producer of \"60 Minutes\" on CBS.  \"He's a very good interviewer.\"  Dershowitz adds that Koppel \"is like a good cross-examiner.  He's the best interviewer I've had.\"  Small says that Koppel always asks \"tough questions with the kind of alacrity that's not afraid to risk affecting the interview in a bad way.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm not sure if there'd be a show without Ted.\"  Shales says.  \"He's as important to 'Nightline' as Carroll O'Connor was to 'All in the Family,' and the similarities don't end there.\"  Shales refers not to Archie Bunker's bigotry but rather to O'Connor's ego, which, he says, became legendary in television circles.  \"Ted has an enormous ego It's impossible not to at that level.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"He has a Napoleon complex,\" Shales says \"Ted's short, and he's conscious of exerting a grandeur.  On 'Nightline,' he's the monarch of all he surveys But,\" Shales adds, \"I think he keeps it under control.\"</span></p> <p><span>Shales mentions as an example of this attitude an item which appeared in the Washington Post last month and that described Koppel's new indoor pool Complete with the \"Nightline\" logo in fiber-optic lights, the item said, the black pool was visible from most ground floor rooms.</span></p> <p><span>\"Koppel himself will tell you he takes himself very seriously.\"  Hewitt says.  \"But I would hope he did the pool as a joke.  If it's true.  I hope he's laughing at himself.\"</span></p> <p><span>While Koppel says \"you have to ignore stories like that,\" he nonetheless takes a moment to explain.  \"There is no 'Nightline' logo on my pool,\" he says.  \"There is a white tile outline of a city scope and some fiber optics that give it a starlight effect.  It was the contractor's idea and was meant as a whimsical touch for the family.\"</span></p> <p><span>When he talks about his family and the power of television in general, and \"Nightline\" in particular, Koppel sounds like a confident, contented man with an uninflated ego.  Small says Koppel has \"a marvelous self-deprecating sense of humor,\" and Koppel admits his mistakes:  \"of course I've said stupid things on the air.\"  Lord adds that Koppel \"cares about his staff.\"</span></p> <p><span>Koppel says that he also cares about his family and his privacy.  He will not speak in any detail about his four children, whom he hopes to keep out of the public eye.  And he notes with pride that his wife took and passed the bar exam on her first attempt and now practices law.</span></p> <p><span>In 1976, when Grace Anne Koppel wanted to return to school.  Koppel offered his resignation to ABC so that he could stay at home.  While he and ABC eventually arrived at an alternative plan--he remained on half-pay and broadcast radio commentaries from home--Koppel nonetheless accepted reduced exposure.  \"I don't know anyone who would have done that,\" Small says.</span></p> <p><span>Koppel explains his reasoning simply:  \"At one point in our lives, my wife, who was a Ph.D candidate at Stanford, gave up her career so that I could be a foreign correspondent.  So when she wanted to go to law school.  <i>I</i> took time off.\"  He worried little about his own career, he says.  \"I had time to lose.  I started early enough.\"</span></p> <p><span>In fact, the 44-year-old old Koppel started roughly 36 years ago.  \"I knew I wanted to be a broadcast journalist when I was eight or nine,\" he says.  \"In my most formative years.  I listened to the likes of Edward R. Murrow.\"  The British-born Koppel came to the U.S. in 1953, spent his undergraduate years at Syracuse University and received a Masters in journalism from Stanford.  In 1963, he joined ABC and reported from Vietnam--he learned Vietnamese before he left--and then headed the network's Hong Kong bureau.  In 1977, he became the anchor of the ABC \"Saturday Night Evening News.\"</span></p> <p><span>While someone like Walter Cronkite has said that his prominence often prevented him from leaving the anchor booth to report stories from the field.  Koppel says that he doesn't worry about the effects of his increased exposure and celebrated status.  U.S. News and World Report, for instance recently named him one of the nation's 30 most influential individuals.</span></p> <p><span>\"If you don't play that [celebrity] role the way you carry yourself people will bother you to a minimum,\" he says.  \"And God has given me all the attributes to go by unnoticed.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Koppel isn't afraid to be noticed during a debate on \"Nightline.\"  Dershowitz says.  \"I've seen Koppel say to two guests.  'You two agree,' when they're trying to create unnecessary controversy.  He's very fair.  He's been very tough on [the Rev. Jesse L] Jackson, for example, and very tough on those who oppose Jackson.  Koppel has created his own non political constituency,\" he adds.</span></p> <p><span>Koppel won't discuss his own political leanings, but does offer an analysis of President Reagan's success.  \"Reagan has a simple way of articulating simple thoughts,\" he says.  \"And TV is a simple medium, that lends itself to simple things.  Reagan hardly if ever gets too complicated.\"</span></p> <p><span>To collect fodder for his programs.  Koppel says that he reads five to six newspapers a day, employs two research assistants and helps his producers plan each show.  Even so, problems occur.  Lord, the former executive producer, recalls a show that examined the abortion issue.  \"I cued him that we had thirty seconds left and Ted said to his guest.  'Well, we're going to have to abort this interview.'\"</span></p> <p><span>Others say that on occasion \"Nightline\" has an additional problem as well.  \"Sometimes they touch too many bases,\" Royko says.  \"They shouldn't beat a dull story to death.\"  And Dershowitz adds, \"there's not a major event every day that warrants coverage on 'Nightline'.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"It's the nature of journalism to focus on the immediate, and the immediate isn't always important,\" Koppel says.  He also admits that a few shows have been less than intellectually stimulating.  \"We did one from the base of Mt. Everest Technologically, it was miraculous.  But there wasn't a whole lot to say, especially after we lost touch with the climbing team.\"  \"The program was kind of nothing,\" he continues.  \"Every once in a while the shows are, quite frankly, boring We did a totally sweet and forgettable show on the Cabbage Patch dolls.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Koppel also sounds proud of many \"Nightline\" segments.  he counts among his favorites one broadcast from Harvard on nuclear strategy--\"the interplay was very good\"--and a recent show that paired the Iranian and Iraqui ambassadors.  \"There's something ironically bizarre about that,\" Koppel says.  \"The last time they talked was on Nightline.  That's wonderful TV, even instructive.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"People want to be on the broadcast,\" Lord says.  And Lord describes the force \"Nightline\" can exert.  He recalls that during the Hostage crisis, the program invited the Iranian charged affaires and Dorthea Morefield, a hostage's wife, to appear together.  \"In a live interview, she pressed the charge about why mail wasn't delivered to the hostages.  We learned later that within one week after that show the mail was delivered through the process of confrontation.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Koppel says that he doesn't \"accept television diplomacy.  it implies that TV has the capacity to bring together people who might not otherwise communicate.  Television is of course powerful,\" he continues.  \"Access is power, and many people gain most of their information from television.\"  Koppel also believes that television news programs have their limits.</span></p> <p><span>\"When you're dealing with a TV program, you cannot hope to duplicate reality.  To suggest that television has even the capability of supplanting news magazines and books is ludicrous.  Television like 'Nightline' can get people interested in subjects they might not otherwise sample.\"</span></p> <p><span>And Koppel thinks that, along those lines, \"Nightline\" succeeds.  He notes that Harvard is \"taking the whole 20 hours of the crisis game [a portion of which aired as a special 'Nightline' that examined possible action during a nuclear crisis] for educational purposes.\"</span></p> <p><span>Koppel says he's content on \"Nightline,\" and in fact, that he discouraged talk of his replacing the late Frank Reynolds as anchor of \"World News Tonight.\"  \"I don't think Ted believes that 7 p.m. would be particularly advantageous to him.\"  Shales says, because it would not allow Koppel's interviewing skills to shine.</span></p> <p><span>\"Koppel gives ABC class and respect,\" Shales adds.  \"He's the fair-haired boy there--if an aging and soon-to-be-gray haired boy, too.\"</span></p> <p><span>Even though Koppel doesn't call \"Nightline\" an \"educational program,\" he says he's pleased that others disagree.  \"He and 'Nightline' make me think,\" Dershowitz concludes.  \"And that's not an easy thing to do at 11:30 at night.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Connect-the-Dot Politics | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>HY?  WHY DID Mario Cuomo offer up 400 exhaustive and, at times, exhausting pages chronicling his ascension to the governorship of New York State?  Political books are rarely written merely to enrich the intellectual content of bourgeois existence.  Sen. Gary W. Hart (D-Colo.) did not churn out <i>A New Democracy</i> because he fancied himself a renaissance man, nor did Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54 (D-Mass.) pen a how-to nuke freeze guide because he could only express his heartfelt convictions in mass market soft-cover.</span></p> <p><span>The answer, in this crucial election year, is self-evident.  Cuomo intends to play a major role in the Presidential race, if not as the vice-presidential nominee, then as a campaign Svengali.  And because the words in these pages are so loaded with a spirit of certitude, the diary is both fascinating and disappointing as a blueprint for action by one of the country's most promising liberal pols.  If one manages to wade through pages of irrelevant detail--lots of short, simple sentences, topped off by the gee-whiz exclamation point--one will find a clearer definition of the Democratic raison d'etre than any offered up by milquetoast Walter F. Mondale.</span></p> <p><span>The discovery should be no surprise, even to those inured to the pandering platitudes proffered by Hart. Mondale, and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson.  Cuomo's credo is defiantly traditional and defiantly conventional.  He states in the regal third-person:  \"...HE WILL [govern] ON THE BASIS OF TRADITIONAL DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, WHICH HE HAS CONVERTED INTO SPECIFIC IDEAS THAT ARE TRADITIONAL AND DEMOCRATIC.\"  Cuomo's vision shines brightly because it is so forthright--government can and should help those who can't help themselves--and so innocent, unsullied by the ravages wrought by deficit spending and the gimmicky neo-liberalism developed by egg-heads in response to President Reagan.  Cuomo recites a manifesto only a slight bit rhetorically different from that uttered by FDR, JFK, and LBJ.</span></p> <p><span>Yet this arguably courageous stand in favor of active government makes no impact, because Cuomo never works through the practical arguments of why we should accept liberalism or what exactly his version of liberalism means beyond welfare politics.  Ronald Reagan has emphatically shown that liberalism does not cut the mustard politically in the '80s, but Cuomo doesn't go beyond lofty rhetoric in refuting this limited vision.</span></p> <p><span>Liberalism is under attack from all sides--political, cultural, and philosophical--and as a political creed it sorely needs a defender, a knight in shining armor.  Yet Cuomo, a deeply religious man, approaches liberalism as he does Catholicism, reciting the party line as an article of faith rather than as the product of intellectual inquisition.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>IME AND time again, Cuomo touches on the key issues of latter-day liberalism--busing, quotas, the death penalty, race relations, labor relations--only to leave the reader grasping for straws.  Recounting a February 21, 1981 speech to a Glen Oaks Jewish group, Cuomo writes:</span></p> <p><span>A decade ago you would have expected a group like this one to be sensitive to the concerns of the minorities, open-minded, compassionate--in a very general sense, 'liberal.'  No such thing today.  There is a fear, an insecurity and an impatience with government that makes these embattled middle-class people lecry of any suggestion that they be called upon to make sacrifices for the people economically beneath them.  For the most part, this group would not even understand that the recent closing of a \"white\" school in Rosedale was required by the Constitution.  They oppose busing, period!</span></p> <p><span>Cuomo then proceeds to drop the topic leaving the reader wondering exactly why the issue should be so simple--they oppose busing, ergo they are selfish, period, exclamation mark.  But, in the aftermath of major deterioration in many school systems where students are bused, and the violence and \"white flight\" that greeted Black students in yellow buses in South Boston in 1974, the concept of busing is no longer blindly accepted, even by many self-described liberals.  Yet Cuomo blithely dismisses his audience, without actually telling us--or himself--why they are wrong.</span></p> <p><span>The book fails to present an adequate argument for good old-fashioned liberalism for several reasons, not the least of which is that Cuomo was too lazy to present a cogent narrative.  He relies instead on notes written at the dining room table at 5:30 a.m. or after a vigorous 15-hour day of campaigning.  Were Cuomo a more fluid and captivating writer, the diary form would have been acceptable, but Mario is no Hunter S. Thompson, and his prose is more akin to a connect-the-dots game than a straight narrative line.  Though the account is quite lively when describing Cuomo's and Koch's battle down to the wire for the Democratic nomination, the diary form is woefully inadequate when it comes to shedding light on events, motivations, and philosophies.</span></p> <p><span>Just as Cuomo complains in his diaries of the triumph of the superficial over the meaningful, so too does his account skirt any developed coherent discussion of the man's deepest beliefs and convictions.  \"People are susceptible to simplistic--and erroneous--answers.\"  Cuomo writes, before launching into:  \"The whole criminal system needs rehabilitation, unemployment must be relieved, a loss of spiritual values has created a vacuum--but many people believe the answer is the electric chair.  It's easier to believe that, I have to find a way to tell what I believe is the truth--and get it understood.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Cuomo never outlines what he would do to make the criminal system more efficient.  Nor does he articulate any striking policy proposals in any of the areas he touches upon.  While Cuomo rightly decries the simplistic, gut response to problems, he, in return, offers only sincere, well-meaning, but equally simplistic Democratic platitudes.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>NE EXPLANATION for Cuomo's lack of substance on these issues is, of course, that he is describing a hectic primary and general election campaign, a quest he describes as distasteful and degrading:  *</span></p> <p><span>It's a business that can make you forget--at least in the frenzy and heat of the campaign--who you are, what you are, and what you're supposed to be.  Because the goal is so complete--taking so much of one's energies and concentration--unless one is very careful, everything else is eclipsed.  That happens in life all the time:  a temporary delight can be so tempting that it makes us forget a greater good.  That happens in a concentrated way in a campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Why did Cuomo choose to write about his campaign, rather than about his first year in Albany?  Is it because the Rocky theme music that set the tone for his underdog effort in the campaign would seem out of place for a man who is trying to play kingmaker in the Democratic party?  Or because the Governor's handling of early budget troubles has led many to believe he's not quite as compassionate as he would have us believe?</span></p> <p><span>Compared to the usual lot in Albany and among Party brass.  Cuomo is better than most.  He has his heart in the right place.  But if he hopes to resuscitate the Democratic party and once again craft a liberalism that is a valid option in a post-technological society, he must do more than think nice thoughts.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Days of upheaval | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>F</b>rustrated by the inconveniences wrought by their House renovations, a group of Dunster House seniors recently spearheaded a joke campaign to \"put the mortar back in mortarboard.\"  They hung a sign-up sheet in their dining hall asking how many classmates would be willing to go through Commencemment exercises sporting hardhats.  About 40 volunteered.  If you had to pick one symbol for the Class of 1984's four-year stay in Cambridge, it would have to be a hard hat.</span></p> <p><span>During their last week at Harvard, an assortment of seniors and officials summoned up the most memorable images and moments of the past four years, and construction crews were prominent among them.</span></p> <p><span>Kirkland and Eliot had also been overhauled this spring, as have three other River Houses in the past two years.  And for those undergraduates who have managed to escape the House renovations, the construction in the Square has provided sufficient disruption.</span></p> <p><span>Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III has observed Harvard College for 25 years, and he notes that over the past four \"there hasn't been a sense of the Square as a front yard for Harvard.  That cafe life is a very important part of the College experience.  It really hasn't been a important part recently.\"</span></p> <p><span>To be more specific, the House renovations have meant scaffolding in idyllic courtyards and hammering early in the morning.  In Lowell House two years ago they triggered a spate of false fire alarms.  In Adams House this year they left rooms without phone service several weeks into the first semester.  Ari W. Epstein '84 says in Dunster \"people have had glass broken into their rooms.\"  Leonard I. Ganz '84 of Lowell House recalls of his sophomore year:  \"you would hear a bang on you door at 8 o'clock in the morning, five construction workers would come in, smoking cigars, sit down on your couch and watch TV.  Eventually one would pull out a razor and start scraping paint.\"</span></p> <p><span>Work in the Square has created similar unpleasant memories.  Some students have approached the ruins with intellectual curiosty, such as Ryan C. Reetz '84, wo crawled into the Mass. Ave. ditch one night freshman year to look around.</span></p> <p><span>Others express irritation at the extension of the subway red line and a concurrent development boom, which have generated constant noise, levelled century-old buildings literally overnight, and closed sidestreets.  Traffic patterns--as well as the location of Out of Town News--have changed almost daily.</span></p> <p><span>Another disadvantage of the march towards progress has been the loss of favorite hangouts.  One Potato, Two Potato fell victim to the wrecking ball in March and was mourned by one senior as the only \"decent, somewhat respectable restaurant\" in the area.</span></p> <p><span>Other changes seniors remember have not stemmed directly from the construction projects, but fit in with the drive for increasing respectability.  Brigham's trimmed its daily hours from 24 to 12.  Harvard Pizza--the only pizza place open past 1 a.m.--was replaced by a used bookstore.</span></p> <p><span>To Kevin J. Avery '84, \"what hurt the most was what they did to Harvard Square Theater.\"  It used to be a run-down, one-screen auditorium which featured only second-hand double features and occasional live productions--such as the stage version of Rocky Horror Picture Show, which came in October of freshman year.</span></p> <p><span>\"We used to go every weekend,\" Avery says.  \"The place had a lot of character--holes in the seats, paint falling off the ceiling, drunken bums.\"  After sophomore year the cinema was renovated, and split into three screens, two for first runs.  \"Suburbia,\" he scoffs.</span></p> <p><span>Since freshman year, seniors have seen the number of ice cream establishments increase from six to 10--and Belgian Fudge was transformed into Emack and Bolio's.  The most profound change came when Somerville-based Steve's opened up branch on Church St.  It made the much-heralded ice cream more accessible, yet to some the move took away its romantic appeal.  \"It used to be an expedition, like after finals were all over,\" says Ann L. Shalof '84, \"now it's like 'where do you want to go for ice cream?'  'Well I went to Herrell's yesterday, let's go to Steve's.'\"</span></p> <p><span>Within the Yard, the Class of '84 saw a Henry Moore statue placed in front of Lamont, land a designer guardhouse by Johnston Gate.  Sever Hall got a facelift, and lost the blackboard with \"Do Problem 2A Only\" mysteriously painted on it.</span></p> <p><span>Nothing, however, provoked a reaction comparable to the announcement spring semester of sophomore year that the ivy would be stripped from the walls.  University botanists contended that the plant's tendrils hastened building decay and recommended permanent removal.  David T. Stern '84 helped organize \"Save Harvard's Ivy,\" a grassroots movement which sponsored a rally, circulated petitions, met with alumni and administrators, and generated a lot of national publicity.</span></p> <p><span>\"It started out on a humorous level, but it got very serious once we started thinking about it,\" Stern says.  \"One of the resons people feel comfortable about Harvard is the seenery.  It's nice once you step inside the gates to see ivy on them.  Ivy has turned into a symbol for the school itself.\"  The next fall administrators reversed their decision.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he forces that have shaped the Harvard Class of '84 go deeper than the structural level.  Epps calls the graduating class the \"Reagan generation,\" not because of the ideological solidarity--far from it--but because the style and substance of campus politics has been powerfully shaped by President Reagan.</span></p> <p><span>Just six weeks after they arrived at Harvard.  Reagan won the presidency and the Republicans captured the Senate.  The coincidence of a sharp break in their personal lives and a sharp change in the country's leadership has indelibly marked November 4, 1980 in their minds.  Like the assassination of John F. Kennedy for an earlier generation, almost every senior knows where he was and what he was thinking the night of that election.  For the largely liberal student body, the reaction was shock.  James Orenstein '84 was in the middle of a play rehersal when \"someone broke in and said that Carter had conceded and Reagan had won.  Everyone was stunned, they just stood there.\"</span></p> <p><span>Rhonda L. Karol '84 was walking back from the library when we saw a group of students sarcastically singing \"God Bless America.\"  Laura A. Haight '84 remembers \"getting drunk with a friend of mine who had never gotten drunk before.  A bunch of us went around wearing black.\"</span></p> <p><span>Eliot T. Kieval '84 joined 200 other students the next day in a hastily organized \"Unite Against the New Right\" rally by Memorial Church.  \"We chanted and sang songs, but I left early because I realized it wasn't going to do anything.\"</span></p> <p><span>The long-term effects of that election are difficult to assess.  The Reagan Administration has sparked a lot of criticism, and in the spring of freshman year 2000 people marched through the Yard and the streets to protest the United States policy toward El Salvador.  Two years later, several hundred students showed up at a demonstration against draft registration.</span></p> <p><span>Yet some have suggested that the last four years saw a relative calm descend on campus.  Haight says the Reagan years \"have just made people more cynical and disillusioned.  It almost seems silly to spend time on one issue when everything's going wrong.\"</span></p> <p><span>Ford Professor of Social Science Emeritus David Riesman '31 concurs that the long shadow of the Reagan presidency has fostered a sense of \"futility,\" especially on the issue of nuclear weapons.  He notes that while the issue has sparked intense interest around the country, it has attracted little political action here--a sharp contrast with the late 50s and early 60s when Riesman and some colleagues drew hundreds of students to fight for the test ban.</span></p> <p><span>When Dr. Helen Caldicott, one of the leaders of the anti-nuclear movement, appeared at the Quincy House Dining Hall earlier this spring, \"she got a polite round of applause from some of the people there--half the people didn't even turn around to stop eating,\" says Steven R. Swartz '84.</span></p> <p><span>Epps finds the change encouraging.  He says the Class of '84 represents a new generation that is \"less idealistic and more wise,\" a group which \"strikes a balance between passionate commitment and practical use.\"  The seniors are \"less a part of the national and international struggle than their predecessors, college is a time to be apart from the world.\"</span></p> <p><span>While that may be true, interest in campus issues has remained strong and perhaps even intensified.  One movement which practically every student or administrator cites as dominating the past four years has been the women's movement.  Two highly publicized cases of prominent male professors sexually harassing women students and faculty, as well as a survey showing that a very high proportion of women at Harvard have been threatened is some form, brought unprecedented attention to the question.</span></p> <p><span>John R. Marquand, assistant dean of the College, says that a \"change in consciousness has permeated social relations between men and women.  People are more self-conscious about being alert to these issues.\"  Swartz says that when he first came to Harvard.  \"I wasn't sensitive to or as knowledgeable about harassment.\"  He says he first thought the specific cases were isolated incidents, and that he was surprised by the studies.  In the fall, as news director of WHRB, he talked to the staff and told them \"to be extra careful of how they treated the compers, that they were in a special relationship,\" Swartz adds.  \"I wouldn't have ever broached that subject with people if it hadn't been for the news over the last year.\"</span></p> <p><span>Campus political procedure has also changed during the class of '84's tenure.  The disjointed, ineffectual student government centered around the Student Assembly died at the end of sophomore year, and was replaced by the centrally funded Undergraduate Council the next fall.  With student-faculty committees and the power to fund student activities, the Council earned the respect of many administrators and undergraduates.  Kieval remembers March of his sophomore year, when plans for the nascent organization were placed under students' doors.  \"I always thought that student government was a joke,\" he says, adding that when he read the Undergraduate Council charter, \"something in my mind clicked.  I said this is it, this is good.  I must get involved.  This was a way for students to start expressing their opinion and maybe be taken seriously.\"  Kieval won a Winthrop House seat the next fall, and went on to become Council historian and treasurer.</span></p> <p><span>The past four years have seen the evolution and establishment of the Core Curriculum.  Dean of the Faculty Henry Rosovsky's pet project.  Many seniors have praise for the new course offerings, but some of the more memorable aspects of the program have been the problems affiliated with its growing pains.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the horror stories resulted from over-subscribed courses.  One of the most infamous was Moral Reasoning 21 taught in spring 1982, which Visiting Philosophy Professor Ronald Dworkin taught as a discussion course before 800 people in Sanders Theater.  Another was Literature and Arts B-16, which in the spring of 1983 drew 600 students to a 400 maximum course.  Flip-flops in the admissions policy, with lotteries cancelled as fast as they were created, caused mass confusion up until the study card deadline.</span></p> <p><span>And for the first time in many years, varsity athletics set the campus on fire.  In the past four years, several men's and women's teams snagged championships, converting hundreds of undergraduates known for the relative lack of enthusiasm into wildly cheering fans.  Many seniors cite athletic events as their most vivid Harvard memories--including the victory over Yale in the hundredth edition of The Game to snag a part of the Ivy Title, and the heartbreaking loss to the Penn football team on a last second field goal.</span></p> <p><span>The hockey team's hot streak, culminating in a second place NCAA finish in 1983, generated the most electricity.  Andrew A. Bernstein recalls the first sign of success the Beanpot victory of 1981.  \"The Harvard band played on the subway on the way back.  People did not want to let people on who were not from Harvard because they wanted to sing Harvard songs.\"</span></p> <p><span>In Bright Arena during the following two years, there were probably more seniors assembled as a single place than there had been since freshman week, and more than there would be until this morning.  \"You could feel as if you were a part of it,\" says Berstein.  \"The crowd got the team going as much as the team got the crowd going.\"</span></p>"}

Instead, the grant was from the Environmental Protection Agency for a Congressional pollution control project.</span></p> <p><span>The faculty member declined to accept the grant because its contract included a \"technical direction\" clause, which would have allowed the federal government the power to direct the investigator's research.</span></p> <p><span>Federal research grants in the past few years have been accompanied by increasingly restrictive terms, recent contracts with traditionally liberal agencies like the EPA and Department of Health and Human Services have included provisions for stricter publication review, technical direction by the sponsor, and funding rules.</span></p> <p><span>And despite the fact that only one grant has actually been turned down, the University has begun to feel threatened in other, less tangible ways.</span></p> <p><span>\"We haven't felt the practical effects [of more restrictive government grants] like Caltech [the California Institute of Technology] and others,\" says John H.F. Shattuck, newly appointed vice president for government, community and public affairs, \"but there are principles worth fighting for here.\"</span></p> <p><span>Shattuck adds that there will be long-term damage to the academic community as a whole resulting from regulations restricting publication, prohibiting the exchange of information to foreign nationals, and labeling certain types of research classified.\"</span></p> <p><span>Part of broader inroads into First Amendment rights, including the curtailment of the Freedom of Information Act, the more severe restrictions on sponsored research became prominent in 1981.  Three regulations in particular since then have affected research at major universities.</span></p> <p><span>In April 1982, President Reagan issued Executive Order 12356, widening the executive branch's discretion to classify certain research as \"sensitive\" in the national security context.  Although some similarly restrictive attempts have been blocked by Congress, many inter-agency regulations bypass congressional review.  In April of this year, for instance, the Department of Defense said it would place pre-publication clauses in some of its grants and contracts, though it has since relaxed some of the restrictions.</span></p> <p><span>Currently, congressional debate over the parameters of the Export Control Act threatens to erode academic freedom further--\"export\" has come to include the exchange of papers at international conferences and presence of foreign nationals at American universities.  A 1983 National Academy of Sciences staff report concluded that \"the proposed rules [potential amendments to the Act] seem to have the potential to have a significant effect on the U.S. scientific enterprise.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although Harvard has withstood the financial tightening of the past two years, it may not be able to do so in the future.</span></p> <p><span>\"For the first time, we can actually foresee turning down awards,\" says A. Simone Reagor, associate director for research administration, whose office negotiates all faculty proposals and sponsored research offers.  While most of the 2000 contracts per year flow through the office smoothly--particularly those coming from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institute of Health (NIH)--about 25 a year must be renegotiated to meet the Faculty of Arts and Science's relatively stiff policy on acceptances of</span></p> <p><span>Harvard's policy, established by a Faculty committee in 1970 and last revised in October of 1983, consists of seven principles.  The two relevant to recent federal proposals prohibit the acceptance of grants that \"carry security classification\" and restrict the investigator's right to publish findings.</span></p> <p><span>These guidelines, which officials say are fairly rigid compared to other major research faculties, may mean a reduction in sponsored research grants for Harvard.  At about $4 million annually, the University's Department of Defense-sponsored research projects may be lost if that branch's pre-publication proposal holds, says Richard B. Leahy, associate dean of the Faculty for research and allied institutions.</span></p> <p><span>But Defense Department-sponsored research makes up less than 25 percent of Harvard's (including the Medical School) $106 million total budget from externally funded research grants and contracts.  The majority comes from NIH ($67 million) and NSF ($14 million) awards.  Even in the rare case of a loss of all Department of Defense monies, Harvard research funding as a whole would not decrease significantly.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to direct funding losses, however, Faculty members seeking financial support would face other worries, says Shattuck.</span></p> <p><span>\"Not only would people turn down grants, but now they are thinking twice about applying for any grants with strings attached,\" he remarks.</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>aculty members doing basic research--which is not intended to lead to a specific product to technology--used to be free from restrictions such as pre-publication review and technical direction clauses.  But the line between basic and applied, or mission-oriented, work has become blurred, leaving all research work vulnerable to checks in the name of national security.</span></p> <p><span>\"What is basic research in one area may be applied in another or to a person with another objective,\" says Dean of the Division of Applied Sciences Paul C. Martin '51.  For instance, some Harvard work in high-energy physics, funded by the Department of Energy, or NASA-funded projects could be considered to have practical applications in the long-term future, making them important for national security.</span></p> <p><span>Proponents of the new Defense Department regulations and executive orders on research have cited the potential threat of \"sensitive\" information getting into the wrong hands as just cause for limitations on academic freedom.</span></p> <p><span>At the 1982 gathering of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, then high-ranking CIA official Admiral Bobby Inman juxtaposed national security and academic freedom:</span></p> <p><span>There is an overlap between technical information and national security which inevitably produces tension.  This tension results from the scientist's desire for unconstrained research and publication, on the one hand, and the federal government's need to protect certain information from potential foreign adversaries who might use that information against this nation.</span></p> <p><span>By Inman's yardstick, just about any scientific field--including research in agriculture, computers, and manufacturing procedures--has the potential for damaging U.S. national security.</span></p> <p><span>Even a report authored by physicist Dale Corson, a former president of Cornell University, pointed out \"gray areas\" of research which might necessitate publication and other security checks.</span></p> <p><span>But Shattuck insists that there need not be a trade-off between national security and academic freedom.  \"I think we get in a very dangerous bind when we face academic freedom off against national security,\" he says.  In fact, he continues, the \"great openness\" of the \"American scientific community is one of the country's national strengths.</span></p> <p><span>Although many on the national level have attributed the stepped-up limitations on government-funded research to heightened concern with defense and national security issues, some at Harvard cite other causes for the tightening.</span></p> <p><span>\"My feeling is that it's trend that's been building gradually in the federal government, not specific to [the] Reagan [Administration],\" Martin says, adding.  \"It just reflects a growing bureaucracy.\"</span></p> <p><span>The \"national security\" debate, Reagor says, seems to confuse military with other issues of importance to the country's future.  \"Agencies seem to be moving more towards separating the government's interests from the public interest,\" she adds.  This climate, she says, supports such research restrictions as the pre-publication and technical direction regulations.</span></p> <p><span>But a top official in the Office for Sponsored Research, Patricia R. Benfari, disagrees.  Benfari says the problem has been greater under the current Administration.  Harvard negotiators have been successful in working out clauses which, if grants were accepted, would violate the Faculty's guidelines, but \"It's harder to deal with Washington agencies now.  It takes longer, and they're more rigid,\" she says.  Last year, Benfari's negotiating team had to modify between 25 and 30 sponsorships to bring them up to Faculty standards of academic freedom.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>he Office of Sponsored Research tackles the problem on a case-by-case basis, but other elements of the University go straight to the source--in groups.</span></p> <p><span>Several organizations of colleges and universities plan to lobby heavily this year to prevent further encroachments on researchers' autonomy.  These include the Council on Government Relations, \"Little Eleven\"--an informal group of the nation's top 11 research universities--and the Association of American Universities (AAU), to all three of which Harvard belongs.</span></p> <p><span>University officials say Harvard has been slow to take the lead in responding to the Defense and other departments new regulations, primarily because Harvard has escaped concrete harm.  But with President Bok chairing the AAU next year and Shattuck's interest in the issue, this is expected to change.</span></p> <p><span>\"We need to be in the lead, fighting for the integrity of research,\" Shattuck says, adding.  \"We haven't yet made this the priority that I plan to make it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Still, Harvard will be far behind the early leads of universities like Caltech, MIT and Stanford, which will be hardest hit by the actual and proposed limitations on publication and exchange of research.  In April, the presidents of the three universities formally protested the Department of Defense's announcement that it would be more liberal in classifying scientific research as \"sensitive,\" making it subject to greater restrictions in publication.  The presidents have met with officials, including Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger '38, says Allan J. Lindstrom, Caltech's sponsored research director.</span></p> <p><span>A sizable chunk of Caltech's $50 million sponsored research budget comes from the Defense Department, but almost all of that amount goes for basic rather than applied research.  Few new restrictions effect this money, according to Lindstrom, though researchers are required to submit their findings to the sponsor and publisher simultaneously.  Because the publishing process takes between six months and two years before the findings appear, however, \"the sponsor already has plenty of time to take a look at it, and talking to the professor is necessary,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Lindstrom says he anticipates Caltech will turn down increasing numbers of federal grants and contract in the future, with the imposition of stiffer pre-publication review requirements.</span></p> <p><span>But Harvard and other universities plan to make responses that go beyond simply rejecting contracts.  \"It's now become increasingly clear that the [federal government's] prevailing idea is that information has to be restricted to keep it from falling into the hands of countries who might be enemies of the U.S.,\" says Shattuck, \"and we've got to respond accordingly.\"</span></p> <p><span>Shattuck's office will conduct a study this summer to quantify the effects, if any, of the past two year's stiffer regulations on sponsored research funding.</span></p> <p><span>After those results come in, Shattuck says, Harvard will form \"coalitions and working groups with other institutions concerned about First Amendment issues.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Professors sit on political sidelines | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>H</b>arvard faculty members have traditionally lent their support to political candidates in a variety of ways.  some have put their reputations behind a particular candidate through public endorsements, while others have used their expertise to help politicians by serving as advisors on specific issues.  Still others have become active participants in a candidate's campaign organization.  Ultimately a faculty member may find his support of a candidate leading him through the \"revolving door\" between government and academia.</span></p> <p><span>This year, however, few Harvard professors have opted for a major commitment to any of the presidential candidates.  The reaction of Assistant Professor of Economics James L. Medoff is typical \"I've been a resource to any of the candidates who have had questions about labor issues,\" he says, adding that he has not endorse any of the presidential aspirants.</span></p> <p><span>While many professors have given their advice to candidates, few seem to have taken major roles in any of the campaigns.  \"I'm not aware of anyone who's taken a leave of absence to work on a campaign.\" notes Joseph S. Nye, professor of Government and a former high-ranking official in the Carter Administration State Department.  Nye adds that his own commitment to former Vice-President Walter F. Mondale's campaign is limited to regular trips to Washington to advise the campaign on foreign policy issues.  As Nye explains his current role.  \"I'm an occasional participant [in the political process].  They ask for advice and I give advice.\"</span></p> <p><span>One way professors this year have shown their support for candidates without taking an active role in their campaigns is through endorsements.  Twenty-one Harvard professors signed a political advertisement endorsing Colorado Senator Gary Hart for president just before the Massachusetts primary in March.  A number of the faculty members who signed the advertisement say they have done no active work on Hart's behalf--either before or after the ad appeared.  Robert Brustein, a drama professor who signed the advertisement, admits for example, \"I was never really actively engaged in the Hart campaign.\"</span></p> <p><span>Hale Champion, executive dean of the Kennedy School of Government, thinks that this may be indicative of a trend towards less faculty involvement in the 1984 elections, a change he attributes to the issues raised in the campaign.  \"There isn't the same level of interest in new ideas:  there are fewer areas of debate,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Sociology Professor Nathan Glazer echoes this point.  \"This seems to be a very quiet political year for the Harvard faculty,\" he contends.  As to why professors have become less involved, Glazer speculates.  \"The issues are not covering the major points of interest of the faculty.  Jackson is clearly a race candidate, so there's a problem there.  Mondale is close to the liberal tradition but lacking in glamor.\"</span></p> <p><span><b><i>\"Compared with previous years, I'd say they are pathetic to apathetic.\"</i></b> <b><i>--Elaine M. Kistiakowsky</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Many faculty members feel that the current crop of presidential candidates is rather uninspiring.  \"Hart is still a bit of an unknown, but a good alternative,\" says Elaine M. Kistiakowsky, assistant to the dean for national security at the School of Public Health.  \"He seems not to have satisfied everyone, yet Mondale is not a terrible person,\" she adds.  \"Mondale fails to excite people.  I worked for Mo Udall a few years ago and there was a lot more enthusiasm then.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kistiakowsky worked actively for Hart when he was in Boston; she even lent furniture to the Hart for President headquarters.  She plans to continue to be active.  \"I'm going as a delegate to the state convention in June, and I've toyed with the idea of becoming a Hart delegate [to the Democratic National Convention].  I will do everything I can to elect as many good Hart supporters to go to the national convention as I can,\" she promises.</span></p> <p><span>She sees another problem with faculty commitment to a single candidate.  \"I frankly think that the faculty is perhaps more cautious than before,\" she says, explaining, \"a lot of the faculty are trying to keep their lines open to more than one candidate.  They want to back a winner.  So they've chosen to act more as experts and advisors without taking a stand.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Compared with previous years, I'd say they are pathetic to apathetic,\" Kistiakowsky concludes.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the most active faculty members in the campaign have significantly centered their involvement around an issue rather than a political candidate.  A group of physicians at the Medical School has been actively working against nuclear weapons.  Because they feel Hart has a strong position on this issue, they have thrown him their support.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. James E. Muller, assistant professor of Medicine, is a co-founder of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.  He and other doctors met with Hart \"several times\" when he was in Boston earlier this year.  \"His response was quite good, and I think he could stop the arms race if he were to be elected,\" Muller says.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>\"I think it is a very legitimate role of an academic faculty to use medical and scientific expertise when they see a problem to bring the debate into the public spotlight.\"</i></b> \u00a0\u00a0<b><i>--James E. Muller, Assistant professor of medicine</i></b></span></p> <p><span>\"I would say the medical faculty has been extremely active on this particular issue,\" Muller contends.  The Hart backer emphasizes that he is not tied to any particular candidate, but would support Mondale as well on this issue if he were the Democratic nominee, \"or anyone except Reagan.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"This is the number one issue in the campaign--and it could lead to human extinction.  Hart is electable--he can beat Reagan, whereas I don't think Mondale can.\"  Muller says.</span></p> <p><span>Muller stresses that his position is important.  \"I think it is a very legitimate role of an academic faculty to use medical and scientific expertise when they see a problem to bring the debate into the public spotlight,\" Muller says, adding, \"And I'm concerned that President Reagan's policies are likely to lead us into a nuclear war.  That's why I entered the political arena.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"The issue is more important than the candidate,\" agrees Lester Grinspoon, associate professor of psychiatry.  \"Three or four of us met with Hart when he was in Boston and chatted with him about the nuclear issue, along with Carl Sagan and others.\"</span></p> <p><span>The physicians' involvement, says Grinspoon, has been limited due to Hart campaign office problems.  \"We had hoped to do some work with Hart,\" Grinspoon says, \"but the campaign was very disorganized.  We had also hoped to send a letter to 200 people in support of Hart, but no one there was able to take responsibility for giving us permission to send it,\" he claims.</span></p> <p><span>Grinspoon switched his affiliation from earlier support for former Sen. George S. McGovern.  \"I thought that Hart was the most effective and could win,\" says Grinspoon, who began his writings on, the nuclear issue with a 1961 article in <i>The New Republic.</i>  \"I think that Mondale could beat Reagan,\" he adds, \"but if Reagan is re-elected I think many more people will be deeply concerned about the possibility of nuclear war.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm interested in a candidate who can offer us some sanity,\" Grinspoon says, \"and that is my interest in Gary Hart.  People who are more politically active are going to be galvanized by their anxiety connected with this issue.\"</span></p> <p><span>But many caution against over-involvement. K. School Dean Graham T. Allison Jr. '62 said earlier this year.  \"It's important that [campaign advisors] are not perceived as representatives of the school.\"  Allison reminds Harvard staff each year that there are strict guidelines in this area, including a rule that professors who take a leave of absence must return within two years or lose their tenure.</span></p> <p><span>As for himself, Allison explains, \"I bend over backwards to be non-partisan, even when it makes me feel personally constrained.\"</span></p> <p><span>Faculty are careful to point out that the nature of their academic work necessarily limits their outside political involvement.  \"There's a problem about being <i>too</i> active with one's political commitments in a university,\" claims Nye.</span></p> <p><span>Nye also cites the fact that a professor must offer his ideas to the larger academic community.  He said that, in addition to advising Mondale, he has also talked to people in the Reagan Administration on substantive issues.  \"One has to maintain a certain openness with one's ideas,\" he says, adding.  \"The Reagan people are aware that I am doing work for Mondale.  But I offer my ideas openly.\"</span></p> <p><span>Medoff feels that a professor's responsibility to his students should also limit his political activities.  \"Given that the faculty is in the business of teaching students, one had to ask if students are gaining or losing by outside political involvement,\" he says.  On the negative side.  Medoff says that if in a 20-hour work week a faculty member spends 19 of those hours or doing research or outside work, then that's too much.</span></p> <p><span>But Medoff adds that he thinks students often benefit from a bit of outside participation.  \"I think outside involvements have enhanced my ability to teach and be more informed.\"  Medoff explains, adding that he often changes his lectures because of knowledge he gains from participating in campaigns.  \"It's a balance, though and it's hard to define the right amount.  Some involvement can be beneficial; too much can be harmful.\"  Medoff declares.</span></p> <p><span>\"My hallmark is that I'm an empiricist, and as such I need to leave my office from time to time to talk with labor leaders,\" Medoff says, adding.  \"Someone who's a theorist may gain less.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>D.

{"title": "Free speech under fire | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>n recent years, colleges around the country have seen a steady increase in loud, disruptive heckling at public speeches on campus.  Harvard has been no exception; in the last two years talks here by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, a Palestinian Liberation Organization spokesman and, most recently, Secretary of Defense Capser W. Weinberger '38 have all been interrupted by aggressive hecklers.</span></p> <p><span>Concerned about the trend, President Bok and the Faculty Council, the Faculty's elected steering committee, are discussing ways to educate students about the need to protect all speakers' rights to free speech.  The Council spent an hour discussing the issue at a meeting this spring, but reached no conclusion save a resolution to determine the best way to define, enforce and enlighten students about a clear University policy.  Casting about for guidance, the group asked Bok to write an open letter on the subject and he has said he hopes to compose such a statement this summer or next fall.</span></p> <p><span>\"People basically agree--with a few exceptions--that we have to do something to remind the students, and the Faculty too, of the importance of the issue,\" says Council member Stephen Owen, professor of Chinese literature.  The key issues before the Faculty are those of when one person's expression of free speech infringes on another's, and how to discipline offenders.  The issue is particularly difficult because \"you get into the line between registering disapproval and abridging someone's right to speak freely,\" says Bok.  It is exactly that line which Council members hope Bok will help draw in an open letter.</span></p> <p><span>During his 13-year tenure as president, Bok has written only seven open letters.  The most recent, distributed last spring, was largely a reiteration of a 1979 statement explaining the University's position on the issue of divesting from companies doing business in South Africa.  The widely circulated letters are reserved for Bok's opinions on issues he considers vital to the health of the University.</span></p> <p><span>Although he has never dealt directly with freedom of speech in a public statement, Bok has written extensively on the related issue of academic freedom, strongly opposing restrictions on scholars based on their professional or political opinions.  The issue first surfaced in 1971-72, Bok's first full academic year as president.  At that time, a number of students--mostly members of the now-defunct Students for a Democratic Society--interrupted several of Pierce Professor of Psychology Richard J. Herrnstein's lectures.  They were protesting what they called his racist views because of an article he had written which concluded that a significant measure of intelligence is inherited.  When the issue came to a head that spring.  Bok defended Herrnstein's right to his opinion, saying, \"I consider such personal attacks to be deplorable regardless of their status under the rules of the University.\"</span></p> <p><span>As difficult as defining a University policy on free speech will be establishing procedures for disciplining students who do infringe on speakers rights.  In 1972, Herrnstein filed a complaint against the students under existing University guidelines--which are still in force--but the cases were eventually dropped when the panel investigating the incidents remained deadlocked.</span></p> <p><span>At Weinberger's speech November 18 in Memorial Hall, he was repeatedly interupted by hecklers protesting the Reagan Administration's military policy in Central America.  Although Weinberger was able to finish his speech, he was forced to repeat himself several times and some members of the audience said the were unable to hear him because of the heckling.</span></p> <p><span>After the Weinberger incident, Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III warned two undergraduates that he had seen them heckling and that future similar actions might lead to disciplinary action.</span></p> <p><span>The operative Faculty legislation on the issue, the 1970 Resolution on Rights and Responsibilities, states \"that intense personal harassment of such a character as to amount to grave disrespect for the dignity of others be regarded as an unacceptable violation of the personal rights on which the University is based.\"</span></p> <p><span>However, the resolution is vague on the issue of discipline, stating only that all grievances will be given a full and fair hearing to be conducted promptly and in good faith.  The issue is further complicated by the fact that the body established to enforce the resolution, the Committee on Rights and Responsibilities, has lain dormant for almost a decade and is a political red flag to some students because of conflicts surrounding its formation.</span></p> <p><span>Exactly what the University should do is unclear and most seem to be waiting for clear direction from Bok.  Some, like Herrnstein, call for strict written guidelines which will make it easy for the University to swiftly punish offenders.  But others, like Vice President of Government, Community and Public Affairs John H. Shattuck, warn against overly specific regulations which might force the University into an awkward position.  People like Shattuck and Owens favor broader statements, in the vein of the Constitution, which would give the University more flexibility in handling future incidents.</span></p> <p><span>Bok seems to agree, saying that the purpose of his proposed open letter would be to examine the issue carefully, but in general terms.  Matters of discipline are traditionally left up to the Faculty and Bok says he would take up only possible ways to think about and discuss the issue, leaving specific recommendations about discipline to the Council.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Lead the Way | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE ONE PIECE of news about the alma mater that reached old-time Harvard alums this year was, in all likelihood, the treatment students accorded Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger '38 at his Sanders Theatre appearance in the fall.  It certainly wasn't good news from their perspective, reports of the heckling and efforts to shout down Weinberger touched the rawest fears of campus disorder inspired by the experience of the 1960s.</span></p> <p><span>The actual news was not as bad as the reports suggested.  It almost never is where Harvard is concerned, given the propensity of the media to turn events here into mega trends.  It is true that a small band of determined speech-wreckers succeeded in drowning Weinberger out at times, clearly abridging his right to free speech.  But the vast majority of students in attendance restricted the cheering or booing to within legitimate bounds of self-expression.</span></p> <p><span>Still, to say the Weinberger incident was an isolated act would be disingenuous.  Writing in 1972 of the effect of student radicals here, Shattuck Professor of Government James Q. Wilson asserted that Harvard was no longer high on the list of institutions in which \"free and uninhibited discussion was possible.\"  The spectre of speech disruptions which troubled Wilson is not as relevant today as the worriers would have us believe.</span></p> <p><span>But the fact of the matter is that this year's confluence of a number of events and movements has brought the issue of academic freedom--which has characterized so much of the political debate in Harvard's history--once again to the fore.  The Weinberger incident was only one of several which helped to dramatize the fragility of a university's atmosphere of \"free and uninhibited discussion\" of issues.  While the issues are distinct--ranging from expression in public forums on the one hand to restrictions on the publication of academic work on the other--they all highlight the frailty of free expression on campus.</span></p> <p><span>Shortly before the Weinberger incident.  Cambridge voters voted on a proposal that would ban nuclear weapons research within city limits.  Luckily, city citizens had the good sense to reject the \"Nuclear-Free Cambridge\" referendum, which would have sent at best an ambiguous message about the nuclear arms race while clamping down on traditional university norms of free and open inquiry.  And several months later, members of the Right showed, not surprisingly, that the Left had no monopoly on improper attempts to subvert free and open inquiry.  Harvard and other universities that get money from the Pentagon for research have been chafing under the Reagan Administration's efforts to censor the publication of unclassified research sponsored by the Defense Department.</span></p> <p><span>Nor has the attack on open debate come only from outside the ivory tower.  In the past year-and-a-half, bands of hecklers have threatened the free speech not only of Weinberger, but also of the Rev. Jerry Falwell and a representative of the Palestinian Liberation Organization.  Muhammed Kenyatta, a Black student leader at the Law School, conversely abridged the rights of participants at a talk by a P.L.O. member when he refused to recognize Jewish members of the audience during the question-and-answer period.</span></p> <p><span>The fundamental principle of any policy towards issues of free speech and academic freedom must be constancy.  If a university--and Harvard in particular--stands for something, it must be, as officials have for so long pontificated, for a commitment to utter openness and freedom of thought and inquiry.  Thus far, however, Harvard's response to these varied attacks on free inquiry and expression have been mixed.</span></p> <p><span>Academia has adequately recognized the threat from outside.  President Bok presented a cogent rejoinder to Nuclear Free Cambridge, while other officials have resolutely assured us that Harvard will not accept any federal funds governed by rules allowing bureaucrats veto power over research results deemed to be \"sensitive\" to national security.  Similarly, official expressions of concern over free speech have been slow in coming but encouraging, as there is news that President Bok will soon draft a statement outlining his defense of the issue.</span></p> <p><span>But these statements seem somewhat disingenuous, for instance, in light of Harvard's failure to act decisively to condemn the law students who refused to allow members of the audience to question a representative of the P.L.O. recently.  Bok did not condemn Kenyatta, even though the Law School incident came shortly after he had heaped abuse on the members of the Pi Eta Club for their sexist newsletter.  The Pi Eta's actions were no doubt despicable--if not a little foolish--but were Kenyatta's any less?</span></p> <p><span>Nor was the University's concern for free expression apparent in its efforts this year--through Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III--to censor the halftime performances of the Harvard Band.  Complaining that the performances did not \"communicate across generations,\" Epps began screening the scripts.  Phrases deleted under this supervision included a line from <i>Macbeth.</i></span></p> <p><span>There must be a strict and consistent approach governing Harvard's attitude on free speech and academic freedom--one in favor of unrestrained openness of idea, and that delicately counterposes freedom of speech with freedom of self-expression, where the two conflict.</span></p> <p><span>These principles, both at Harvard and elsewhere, have been increasingly under seige from self-appointed movements of moral righteousness.  Whether it be against right-wingers who see open research as an invitation to communist subversion, or left-wingers who would shout down the wretched opinions of their opponents, civil libertarians have found the going tough recently.  Harvard has perennially had a difficult time figuring out its proper position on ethical issues, but on the issues of academic freedom and free speech, the moral high road is too obvious to ignore.  It is up to Bok and other members of the administration to clearly and unequivocally show students this way.</span></p> <p><span><b>DISSENTING OPINION</b></span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T IS PATENTLY ABSURD to portray the disruption of Caspar W. Weinberger '38's speech as a violation of freedom.  It was a defense of liberty and a statement of outrage at its usurpation.  The behavior exhibited by the students who shouted him down would indeed be unacceptable if Weinberger were not who he is.  But as spokesman for the Reagan Administration's war policies.  Weinberger has no problem getting his views across, ludicrous as they are.  He has all major media at his beck and call unlike the students who stood up to his propaganda.  This fact alone would not be ample justification for drowning out his comments.  However, Weinberger is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in Central America.  There is no excuse for these murders, and there is no reason why Weinberger's rhetoric should have been tolerated.  The issue is not one of free speech, but one of moral right.</span></p>"}

Since Carter had lifted the restrictions concerning Cuba on March 28, Hubbard's suit contended that Reagan's reinstatement of the restrictions was invalid and to impose them, he would have had to fontually declare a new state of emergency.</span></p> <p><span>The court, however, disagreed, and said that the grandfather clause actually referred to \"authorities\" being exercised on July 1--in this case the authority to restrict travel--not specific prohibitions.</span></p> <p><span>Boudin called the decision irrational and wholly without foundation.  \"There is no case that has so disregarded legislative intent,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>The lawyer is a veteran of right-to-travel laws, having argued several cases concerning the matter before the Supreme Court since 1958.</span></p> <p><span>If the Court grants a rehearing he will stant his argument towards Justice John Paul Stephens, Boudin said.

And he was quoted as saying, \"the potential danger is that people, our foes and some of our friends, will get a wrong and incorrect impression of both our capabilities and our resolve.\"  This, he added, \"in this kind of world, where [impressions are] an essential part of deterrance, is.  I think, a dangerous disservice to the United States.\"</span></p> <p><span>What a tragedy if open inquiry is to become the next casualty of the Reagan-fueled nuclear arms race.  Weinberger's evident dislike of military accountability, so offensive in Grenada, is nothing short of absurd when applied to evaluations like the House subcommittee's.  What appears to concern Weinberger most is not the report itself, but rather the public airing of soiled Pentagon linen.  This, despite the claim of Appropriations Committee Chair Rep. Joseph P. Addabbo (D-N.Y.) that the report had been \"sanitized\" by Defense officials prior to its release.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>EEDLESS TO SAY, it is Congress business to assess the state of U.S. military preparedness, particularly when faced with blockbuster Defense appropriation requests.  And it is everyone's business to keep a watchful and critical eye on government performance, no matter what our \"foes\" may think.  This is what characterizes our society as \"open\" from those the Reagan Administration has pledged to undermine as distastefully \"closed,\" or totalitarian.  Weinberger is certainly not the first to recognize the drawbacks of such openness on military security, but he is among the first to push for its subversion.  Under this administration, the dictates of national security now require the dilution of the very political principles it was meant to defend.</span></p> <p><span>Which is why Addabbo far more closely articulated the spirit of democracy as it is commonly understood, when he responded to Weinberger with the following remark, quoted in the Washington Post.  \"I think we do a great service to our national security,\" he said.  \"By publicizing the report and spotlighting it, maybe we'll get some attention to the waste and fraud.\"</span></p> <p><span>At least some Pentagon officials apparently felt the same way when they issued a subsequent report suggesting that Army and Air Force preparedness had indeed decreased during the Reagan term.  But Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. John W. Vessey, who joined the Weinberger attack on the Congressional document, publicly disputed those internal reports, and the official military line is to second Weinberger's outrage.</span></p> <p><span>Undoubtedly, what has administration officials so up in arms is not the philosophical, but the practical import of the studies.  Despite record defense expenditures, military officials ranging from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to officers in the field have recently testified that the U.S.  Armed Forces are I sufficiently equipped to conduct sustained conventional warfare.  These criticims are a large political embarassment to the \"get tough\" Reagan team, already facing Congressional opposition to proposed defense funding increases.  The relative preparedenss famine in times of Pentagon plenty must be attributed in large part to inordinate expenditures on nuclear over conventional forces and to wide-spread waste.</span></p> <p><span>Assuming the critical reports do not have the calamitous effect of generating sentiment for still greater defense funds--to bolster conventional, along with nuclear forces--concern over military readiness could help stem the growth of the nuclear aresenal.  The danger is that greater \"preparedness\" could mushroom into a dangerous build-up in conventional forces, but in general, any break on the nuclear effort would be a welcome change.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps more immediately significant, however, is the potential impact of the studies on military waste, for it is here that the Administration blind spot is most disconcerting.  Granted Pentagon waste did not start in with the Reaganites, but clearly a fresh perspective is needed when President Reagan calls current U.S. aid to El Salvador--an amount which, according to published estimates allots more than $20,000 per Salvadoran guerilla--\"niggardly,\" and likens the funding to \"letting El Salvador slowly bleed to death.\"  Clearly it is needed when, in the age of $50 screwdrivers and massive cost overruns.  Weinberger says of inefficiency and corruption in Defense contracting:  \"there isn't any to start with, and it has no effect [on preparedness].\"</span></p> <p><span>But perhaps Weinberger should be excused for what one hopes is oversight, his economic textbook says massive inefficiencies and corruption only occur in closed systems--never in Western-style democracy.</span></p>"}

Attorney General of the United States, Secretary of Commerce and Ambassador to Great Britain; the other has never held public office.  One is the quintessential insider; the other the quintessential outsider.</span></p> <p><span>The two men are Elliot L. Richardson '41 and Raymond Shamie, and they both want the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span>Though most of the attention in the Union's most liberal state has focused on the tight primary battle between Democrats Lt. Gov. John F. Kerry and U.S. Rep. James M. Shannon (D-Lawrence), the Republicans, with the not-insignificant help of President Reagan, may retake the seat held by Sen. Paul E. Tsongas (D-Mass.), who is retiring because of cancer.</span></p> <p><span>But before the Republicans can turn their attention toward the Democrats, they must settle an internecine struggle for the soul of the state's beleaguered Republican party.  By any estimation, the state's Republicans are in sorry shape; only 12.8 percent of the state's 3,053,143 voters are registered Republicans; only one of the state's 11 congressmen is Republican; and Republicans hold seven of 40 seats in the state Senate and 29 of 160 in the House.</span></p> <p><span>Earlier this year the Republican state committee placed want ads in local newspapers to find men and women to run for the legislature.</span></p> <p><span>The one bright spot is Ronald Reagan, who narrowly carried this liberal state in 1980 and is expected by many to do so again in November.</span></p> <p><span>Consequently, both Richardson and Shamie have gone to great lengths to point up their similarities to the Great Communicator.  The problem is that the two have widely divergent views on many foreign policy matters, and have strikingly different approaches to government and their prospective roles as senator.</span></p> <p><span>Shamie says that like Reagan, he is philosophically oppposed to increasing taxes, even though the President last year signed into law a nearly $100 billion \"revenue enhancement\" bill and appears likely to support some tax increases in the future.</span></p> <p><span>Richardson claims that top-level Administration officials personally asked him to run for Senate after Tsongas' withdrawal even as he criticizes Reagan nuclear policy and involvement in Central America.  The Law of the Sea Treaty, described by one-time delegation head Richardson as his greatest achievement, was scuttled by the newly-elected Reagan, who said its terms were unfavorable to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>On paper, Richardson appears to be in better shape.  Polls show him leading <i>all</i> candidates in the race, and his 35-year political career easily makes him the best known of the top four contenders.  Like many Republican Senators and Congressmen in the Northeast, he is a moderate, favoring a reduction in nuclear armaments, opposing the B-1 bomber and MX missile, and supporting the Contadora call for negotiations in Central America.</span></p> <p><span>In April, Richardson was quoted as saying he \"might well have joined the rebellion against\" the right-wing Salvadoran government before the rebels received Cuban and Soviet backing.  Shamie called Richardson \"naive\" and said in a statement released by his office, \"I would not have joined the Marxist rebels in Salvador, even if they had never been supplied by Cuba and Russia.  They have killed innocent people, and terrorized thousands of ordinary El Salvadoreans for trying to vote.\"</span></p> <p><span>Richardson's most idiosyncratic, some say weirdest, idea is a new Monroe Doctrine that would exclude both the U.S. and Soviet Union from any military involvement in Central America.</span></p> <p><span>Though Richardson, in a recent interview, rejected the label \"liberal Republican,\" he has made it clear that he feels the party must move leftward if it is to gain a Senate seat.</span></p> <p><span>Richardson's friends say he is not proud of his most famous role as Attorney General in the \"Saturday Night Massacre,\" when, during the Watergate scandal, he chose to resign rather than follow then-President Nixon's orders to fire Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox '34.  But campaign advertisements currently running on local TV stations hail his resignation--which made him a hero among liberals--as one of his greatest accomplishments.</span></p> <p><span>\"If anyone were looking at the question of what the positions of a Republican candidate would have to be to have a chance of winning, they would have to come up with a candidate pretty much like me,\" said Richardson.</span></p> <p><span>Richardson said his popularity among independents--who make up 39 percent of the electorate--and moderate Democrats make him the best bet to win in November, and that the Reagan Administration has made maintaining a Senate majority a high priority.  \"They view with some seriousness the objective of maintaining Senate control,\" he added.  \"They [the Administration] think I'm the only Republican candidate who has a strong chance of winning.\"</span></p> <p><span>Shamie, of course, thinks otherwise.  At a Young Republicans convention in Worcester last week, Shamie whipped out a letter from Reagan pledging neutrality in the primary race, and then went on to accuse Richardson of being too tied to the Georgetown cocktail circuit to adequately represent the state.</span></p> <p><span>Shamie, a charismatic businessman and inventor who is making his second run for the Senate, has strived to differentiate himself from Richardson by identifying with working class interests and the solidly conservative ideology espoused by Reagan.</span></p> <p><span>The latest Shamie charge is that Richardson is avoiding debates because he is scared of facing the garrulous businessman.  A lot of these accusations and charges are not worthy of a response.\"  Richardson press secretary David Gilroy said last week.</span></p> <p><span>The two are scheduled to face off on WCVBTV Channel Five's \"Chronicle\" program July 11, and the League of Women Votes has announced televised debates for September.</span></p> <p><span>\"Ray has nothing else to run on,\" charged Gilroy.</span></p> <p><span>Shamie, for his part, insists that he is not being overzealous in his attacks on the more subdued Richardson.  \"The nature of my attacks deals with specific positions, issues, it's not personal, and I don't think anyone should resent the fact that I point out that he flip-flops from one position to another, that he opposes President Reagan on major issues.\"  Shamie said in an interview last week.  \"That's not an attack, that's simply a description of our differences on the issues.\"</span></p> <p><span>State Republicans say that while Richardson is still a strong favorite.  Shamie will have more pull among working class voters who find Richardson to be too cold, too distant and too much of an egg-head.  \"The man in the street understands Shamie's politics more than they understand the Law of the Sea Treaty.\"  State Rep. John R. Driscoll (R-Northbridge) said last week.</span></p> <p><span>\"Shamie's a salesman he'll tell you that him-self.\" Said State Rep. Forrester A. Clark, Jr. '58 (R-Hamilton).  \"He has a very open style he's an easy-to-communicate-with person.  Richardson tends to be a little more distant than the average politician; he never tries to be the hail-fellow-well-met.\"</span></p> <p><span>Most state politicans agree that Richardson's toughest hurdle may be Shamie.  The September 18 primary will be contested among hardcore Republicans, and Richardson will not have the benefit of registered Democrats and many Independents, who can vote in either party primary.  But Richardson may have another problem--himself.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike Shamie, Richardson speaks slowly and quietly, sometimes with a cracking voice, and he often lacks Shamie's energy.  Nonetheless, campaign aides say he is running a grueling 16-hour-a-day campaign schedule and is trying to loosen up his campaign style.</span></p> <p><span>But, said one Democratic political strategist, \"He's still a stiff.\"</span></p>"}

Watergate, very few people can claim to have even been a first-hand witness to any single one of these events.  But Clifton Daniel, former foreign correspondent and managing editor of the <i>New York Times</i> has not only witnessed but played a role in all of them, not to mention several international summit conferences and a multitude of other major events Daniel, though, has no intention of burdening his readers with anything remotely serious.</span></p> <p><span>Instead in his new <i>Lords Ladies and Gentlemen.</i>  Daniel reveals some of the lighter moments of his extensive, eventful career from his meetings with kings to his hobnobbing with presidents.  The book can justly be criticized for an excess of fluttery, for dwelling on the transient rather than the substantial Daniel doesn't care.  He says there has been a \"surfeit\" of overly serious books. \"The world is not waiting for my opinions,\" he adds.  \"But, I've met a lot of interesting people and in the process have acquired humorous stories--some revealing and some devastating.  I just didn't want to get involved with the controversy.\"</span></p> <p><span>Which is not to say there has been no controversy.  Daniel has been in the journalism business since the age of 14, when he began writing for a small paper in his hometown of Zebulon.  North Carolina.  He moved up to write for the Associated Press and then to the <i>New York Times.</i>  His career has also included television and radio appearances, but he says his heart has always been in newspaper journalism.</span></p> <p><span>Looking back on his career, he points to Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill as two men who deserve the most respect.  \"Roosevelt led us out of the depression and saved the country and Winston Churchill stood alone with a tiny Island behind him,\" he says.  \"I have great admiration for President Truman, but I'll skip over him because people assume I'm biased,\" he adds, in a reference to his father-in-law.  Daniel is almost as well known as the husband of Margaret Truman as he is for his journalistic exploits.</span></p> <p><span>Describing some of the other presidents he has known, he says Gerald R. Ford was \"extremely agreeable,\" and President Reagan is a \"miracle man.  He is the only President in my time able to separate personality from policy.\"  On the negative side, he points to Lyndon B. Johnson as the \"greatest disappointment\" of the many dignitaries he has met.  \"He was a superb majority leader and was able to get more progressive legislation adopted than [Franklin D.] Roosevelt, but in the end he didn't have what it took to resolve the greatest issue of his time, the Vietnam War,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Daniel likes to talk about presidents because he's known a lot--10 to be exact, 'a figure he shrinks from in almost false modesty, given his predilection for name-dropping.  \"Anyone my age who has hung around Washington long enough could do the same.  It's nothing special to have known ten presidents.\"  But Daniel lets us all know all the same:  indeed, the name dropping would be boorish if he didn't take such unabashed delight in the practice.  If anything Daniel is out for a little <i>fun.</i></span></p> <p><span>Daniel tells a hilarious anecdote about one time he, his wife and four sons visited Johnson in the White House.  Johnson kept bounding out of his chair to fetch souvenirs for the boys--pens and pads with the inscription \"The President's House.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"All the while the President was chatting away as if he had nothing else in the world to do.  We were taking a ten o'clock train and finally I was obliged to say, 'This has been wonderful Mr. President, but I'm afraid we have a train to catch.'</span></p> <p><span>'\"Aw Clif,' Mr. Johnson said, 'Don't rush off.  The train will wait.'</span></p> <p><span>'\"The train will wait for you Mr. President, 'I told him, 'but it won't wait for me.'\"</span></p> <p><span>They then quickly headed off to the station and when they arrived and were scurrying aboard, the conductor approached and without change of expression said, \"Take your time.  The White House called.\"</span></p> <p><span>Daniel has no regret about the way his book turned out; it is exactly what he intended to write.  \"In the newspaper business it's your duty--your job--to meet interesting people and write about them,\" he says.  \"But people think that anyone who has been managing editor of the <i>New York Times</i> must have something portentous and pompous to say.  I may be portentous and pompous, but I don't want to write that way.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"If you're interested in the big time, you must be interested in the big people--the movers and the shakers.  They make the news.\"</span></p>"}

The immediate impulse is to scurry out and tell your friends all about it.  One gets much the same feeling from reading <i>Lords Ladies and Gentlemen,</i> the memoirs of Clifton Daniel.  Daniel acts the adult equivalent of the kid in the candy shop as a name dropper of the first order.</span></p> <p><span>As the one time foreign correspondent and then managing editor of the <i>New York Times</i> not to mention the husband of Margaret Truman Daniel.  Harry S. Truman's daughter Daniel appears to have known, or at least met, multitudes of VIP's from around the world.  And he spends nearly 250 pages relaying anecdotes and recollections of almost all of them.  What Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands wore or what King Farouk said is about as serious as this book becomes.  It would be downright irritating if it weren't so enjoyable.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the anecdotes are quite interesting even fascinating and there is hardly a person more qualified than Daniel to write such a book.  Through both his personal life (especially as Truman's son-in-law) and his professional he covered events ranging from World War II to Watergate he has met more dignitaries than most people care even to hear about.  He capitalizes on this background, going out to his way to avoid writing the type of book you would expect from the former managing editor of the <i>Times.</i>  He writes not of the inner-workings of the great crises he covered, nor of the interior powerplays of the <i>Times</i> wich he evidently feels have been overcovered.</span></p> <p><span>Instead he concentrates on the frilly, social side of a serious business.  He starts with his recollections of kings, queens and other royals.  Much of it reads like a gossip column, but some of the tidbits, which would never make it into a newspaper column, are often quite revealing of cultures and attitudes of the rich.  He described, for instance, a feast given for the King of Saudi Arabia.</span></p> <p><span>There was the usual display of roast sheep that the guests are with their fingers.  I make my dinner of canned peaches.</span></p> <p><span>All around the tent was a through of villagers men, women and children, hungrily watching the notables cat.  When the party was over they scurried into the tent and ravenously consumed the leftover.  An easy wasy to clear the table.</span></p> <p><span>Daniel goes on, in the most entertaining portion of the book to describe all the American presidents he has known.  He helpfully points out that he has known a fourth of all the American presidents, humbly adding that \"that doesn't necessarily mean that they knew me.\"</span></p> <p><span>From Roosevelt to Reagan, he touches on some personal experience with each president pausing only to drop a few more names along the way Johnson, he writes, was once invited to lunch at the <i>Times.</i></span></p> <p><span>When it was time for the President to leave he seemed reluctant to go.  Twice he asked if there were any more questions and stayed past three o'clock.  Instead of heading for the front door, the President turned into the pantry and shook hands with everybody including his own secret service man who was standing with the dining room stall.</span></p> <p><span>Daniel has equally humorous stories to tell about Winston Churchill, British lords and ladies, Khrushchev, Castro, the CIA, and even some movie stars.  The last few pages are devoted to Margaret Truman, for whom Daniel appears to have great respect.  Daniel even manages to take a shot at Harvard in the midst; on Aga Khan IV '59--who is revered as a god by his subjects--he writes:  \"You might say he is the only divinity with a degree from Harvard, at though some other Harvard graduates have intimations of immortality.</span></p> <p><span>Daniel's unmistakable prediction for aristocracy gets nauseating at times, and his adamant refusal to probe beneath the surface of the personalities he meets can get frustrating.  At certain points--for instance when describing the <i>Times'</i> coverage of the Bay of Pigs--he hints at greater depth, only to pull back to describe an encounter with yet another celebrity.  Still, only perhaps a Talmudic scholar could fail to enjoy the breezy gossip about the rich and famous that Daniel serves up throughout <i>Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen.</i>  As he has forthrightly stated, \"I'm not trying to prove anything, but just trying to give people a bit of pleasure.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "High Court Takes Low Ground | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N HER acceptance speech to the Democratic Convention last week.  Rep. Geraldine A. Ferraro (D-N.Y.) warned of \"a Supreme Court that turns the clock back to the 19th century.  \"She was referring to an array of recent High Court decisions which have made in roads into the most basic personal freedoms protected by the Constitution Perhaps the most clear-cut example of this has been the court's assault on the so-called exclusionary rule.</span></p> <p><span>By handing down a 6-3 decision which allows prosecutors to use illegally obtained evidence in certain cases, the Court has severely curtailed an individual's protection against unwarranted police intrusions.  The exclusionary rule is, in effect, the bite of the Fourth Amendment which grants \"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\"  A logical extension of that right would be the exclusion of the fruits of such illegaly obtained evidence from courts of law.  Hence the application of the exclusionary rule, first introduced in 1914.</span></p> <p><span>When Ferraro speaks, then, of a pre-20th century rollback, she is on the mark--literally.  The decision by the nation's highest court effectively gives judges--who make the decision to give out warrants--and police officers--who carry them out--free reign to search you or your person at the slightest provocation.  As one dissenting justice stated, this move threatens to undermine the entire warrant process because it does not force police or magistrates to prove there is just cause for a search.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT THERE is something even more troubling about this, the latest in a series of decisions which have supported the Reagan Administration's rightist conception of law.  This is the method by which the six justices in the majority decided their position--cost benefit analysis.  In effect, the justices subjected indivisible individual rights to a social calculus, whereby they measured whether the gain from convicting more criminals outweighed the relative loss of an individual's right to privacy.  Justice Byron White was quite explicit on this point:  \"Because we find that the [exclusionary] rule can have no substantial deterrent effect in the sorts of situations under consideration in this case, we conclude that it cannot pay its way in those situations.\"</span></p> <p><span>The justices' frustration over watching criminals get off or get reduced sentences because of legal technicalities is quite understandable.  But this is the price of a criminal justice system which must, above all, protect the rights of individuals.  Instead, we have arrived at a situation where only those rights who can \"pay\" for themselves are unquestioningly protected--and one shudders to think of what would happen to other Constitutional rights were they subjected to a similar cost-benefit analysis.</span></p> <p><span>The implications of the decision for the criminal justice system loom large indeed.  Not only is there no proof that a more narrow application of the exclusionary rule will yield more valid prosecutions, but such cost-benefits, analysis focuses excessively on the short-term pros and cons of laws--rather than the long-range impact of such a major change in this country's governing document.</span></p> <p><span>The majority's rationale--a feeble attempt to appease the stalwart defendants of the Fourth Amendment--justifies this slashing of the amendment by introducing the \"good faith\" concept, which stresses police officers' intentions rather than actions.  \"Particularly when law enforcement officers have acted in objective good faith or their transgressions have been minor,\" reads the majority opinion, \"the magnitude of the benefit conferred on such guilty defendants offends basic concepts of the criminal justice system.\"</span></p> <p><span>The decision gives police officers more leeway in determing whether the evidence constitutes just cause for search and seizure and frees him or her from responsibility for bad decisions.  The Supreme Court, moreover, has given great latitude to magistrates; judges will no longer be held responsible for their decision to grant a warrant and they will have the authority to interpret \"good faith.\"  Those justices who support the narrowing of the exclusionary rule did not understand its two-pronged purpose:  it puts a check on both police <i>and</i> judge, making them both responsible for proving there is just cause for search and seizure.</span></p> <p><span>Dissenting Justice Brennan articulated the newly granted immunity of judges when he said.  \"If their decision to issue a warrant was correct, the evidence will be admitted; if their decision was incorrect but the police relied in good faith on the warrant, the evidence will also be admitted.\"  Such a scenario illustrates the pointlessness of a warrant process without a strict application of the exclusionary rule--it becomes defunct, a meaningless bureaucratic procedure, neither facilitating detailed police work or protecting individuals rights.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T IS LIKELY that the Constitution's framers would be turning in their graves at the majority's application of simple cost-benefit analysis on a question involving one of that document's most sacred amendments.  Their decision \"ignores the fundamental constitutional importance of what is at stake here,\" said Justice Brennan, echoing fellow dissenters Stevens and Marshall.</span></p> <p><span>Coupled with a similarly conservative move last month to allow admission of <i>illegally</i> obtained evidence if it would have inevitably been discovered, this decision sends a dangerous message to law enforcers--telling them that they will not always be held accountable for their actions and probably increasing their inclinations to act without sufficient provocation.  As the rollback on civil liberties continues, Ferraro might have been more on the money to call the Court's decisions regressions to the 18th century, as the exclusionary rule touches the heart of the Bill of Rights.  As Stevens stated, this more narrow application turns \"the Bill of Rights into an unenforced Honor Code that the police may follow in their discretion.\"</span></p>"}

Travers compares fighting for social change to the struggle of a folk song's hero or heroine.  The message is \"you can push for change now, but look for evidence later, often much later.  There's this concept of 'paying your dues,' which everyone must go through.  The same is true for social change; there's no painless solution and you've got to pay your dues.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>NDEED, if there is an identifiable malaise plaguing our generation, it should be this kind of realistic <i>and</i> idealistic conception of change.  Maybe we've been disillusioned or maybe we're just too used to getting everything we desire, but we've been drained of what's supposed to be youthful idealism and creative approaches to problems.  Traver's evolution as an artist and activist provides a rare role model.</span></p> <p><span>Any Peter Paul and Mary album will present an effective mix of sad and allegorical folk songs, angry political songs, and just plain fun songs (like \"Puff the Magic Dragon\").  The songs, together, inspire the highest human virtues--compassion, justice, tolerance, and, something sorely needed in today's music, hope.</span></p> <p><span>Yes, but these are different times and different musical approaches are needed.  Perhaps, but a survey of contemporary pop music hardly inspires the kind of change and activist<i>necessary</i> for a world warring in every hemisphere.  Travers says today's popular music commercially defined by the 13-25 age group, \"articulates for that segment of society, a social angst--a haunting anxiety about the future.\"  Whereas the popular music of the 1960s took on heavy topics with an eye towards change and hope, today's music is fraught with frustration, alienation and egoism.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>LMOST every current top 40 song fits part of all of Travers' description.  A few, however, are worth particular mention, partly because their accompanying MTV videos have further confirmed today's angst.  Both the literal and visual interpretations of, for instance.  Laura Brannigan's \"You Take My Self Control,\" radiate a preoccupation with instant and continuous self-satisfaction.  The haunting flip-side of that egoism is a disturbing loneliness, even more evident in the video.  A similar anxiety--coupled with alienation--from lovers, parents, friends, and self--characterizes Cindy Lauper's \"Time After Time.\"</span></p> <p><span>These and so many more hot-selling pop songs reflect our generation's disillusionment and pessimism.  That pop artists have turned their themes inward only mirrors the larger societal decision to turn their backs on problems, which only seem to get worse and grow in number.  And, even as we turn inward, it is not to celebrate the individual, but to confirm the complementary social and personal alienation.  Such pessimism is a natural reaction to a pretty gloomy future says Travers, pointing to the economic situation and nuclear arms race.  Although no panacea exists, there are small changes to be won.  For this folk singer, such a victory could be won in November with Reagan's defeat.  No, she says everything will not change.  And, no, Mondale does not have all the answers.  There is, however, a choice here.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm not looking for someone who's charismatic--we've got someone like that in the White House now,\" says Travers.  A bit more parent-like, she warns, 'I realize that young people are not turned on [by Mondale], but this is no time to play apathetic.\"</span></p> <p><span>Every artist has a favorite tune, and for Travers it is \"Blowing in the Wind\"--because the song \"applies to so many different situations.\"</span></p> <p><span>Yes it does, and we would be good to heed its warning before November.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Race for The Ultimate Supercomputer | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N JUST OVER thirty-two hours the future of computer development may have moved from strategic blueprints on the desks of high-tech executives to a nationwide trend mapped in stone.  A sixty-nine digit number--the last in a century-old list of seemingly unfactorable numbers composed by a famous French mathematician--was broken down by a Cray supercomputer.  The implications of this are revolutionary.  While the breakdown of the number, more simply known as 2251-1, utilized only a sleek algorithm and no revolutionary advances, it signaled the ever-growing importance of ultra-sophisticated computers.</span></p> <p><span>No longer is it sufficient that we have computers which can replace a horde of mathematicians in both speed and accuracy, or robots which render human laborers \"impediments\" to progress.  The \"new generation of supercomputers,\" as they have been dubbed, will make even the supercomputer which solved the sixty-nine digit puzzle look like a pocket calculator.</span></p> <p><span>A handful of nations around the world have entered a high stakes race to develop faster and more efficient supercomputers.  Ten billion dollars have been committed to such research by industries around the world.  The investment, however, is only a fraction of the envisioned spoils; the winner will corner a five-hundred billion dollar-a-year market of information-age business.  The ultimate Prize is even greater-the development of artificial intelligence.</span></p> <p><span>The future of computers will be determined by the degree of success scientists enjoy with the concept of \"parallel processing.\"  Instead of directing all the computer's labor through a central unit, the work will be divided among many data processing units.  The departure from the \"von Neumann architecture,\" named for its founder, will enable programmers to avoid a \"bottleneck.\"  The rewards could be substantial since the \"von Neumann bottleneck\" has served as a traffic jam which severely restricts the flow of information through the one processor.</span></p> <p><span>Parallel processing, however, is not without drawbacks.  Without proper programming, the separate units could slow to a \"deadly embrace\" if they must await information still passing through another unit.  Experts in parallelism have nevertheless claimed to be approaching a processing speed that exceeds the fastest theoretical rate possible with a \"von Neumann\" processor by a factor of ten.</span></p> <p><span>Critics fear the new trend will culminate in the development of an all encompassing brain, and such worries may not be pure speculation.  Nobel lauireate Herbert Simon, professor of computer science and psychology at Carnegie-Mellon, sees no restrictions on the science and believes that human intelligence will one day be recreated.  Yet if an understanding is what onlookers seek, they had best concentrate on the reeasoning that spawned such efforts rather than on the possible realization of science fiction folklore.</span></p> <p><span>Before an electronic brain could be perfected, it would need a capacity to distinguish between the most minute nuances of languages and psychology.  A common example:  to translate the phrase, \"Mary had a little lamb,\" a computer must distinguish between twenty-eight meanings such as \"Mary owned the lamb,\" \"Mary ate the lamb,\" \"Mary gave birth to a lamb,\" or \"Mary engaged in sexual activity with a little lamb.\"  Because no researcher has yet solved this problem society-at least for a time-is till bafe from an electronic \"Big Brother.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE CURRENT THREAT, though, is not that our government will develop such technology, but that it will not.  The Japanese \"National Superspeed Computer Project\" and \"Fifth Generation Computer Project\" threaten to erase the supremacy of the United States in almost all areas of research.  Already the Japanese boast a computer that is a thousand times faster than the speediest American model.</span></p> <p><span>Super computers today are responsibloe for the derivation of drugs from quantum theory rather than trial-and-error, the simulation of auto and aircraft performance in replacement of test tracks and wind tunnels, and the exploraiton of oil deposits as an alternative to extensive surveys.  And the issue is no longer one of monetary profit alone; the risk is national security.</span></p> <p><span>American hopes are directed at a vast array of government and private projects investigating parallelism and the supercomputers of the future, but nowhere is the effort more visible than where it is most crucial.  The Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has been designe to stimulate research that will insure national security and perhaps the \"Star Wars\" defense advocated by President Reagan.</span></p> <p><span>Consider the problem of the sixty-nine digit number.  The Defense Department long ago created a coding system founded on eighty digit numbers.  By breaking these numbers into their respective factors, the code will be broken.  A new generation of superfast computers could break down such a code in a matter of hours.</span></p> <p><span>The race to build the most rapid and efficient microprocessor is on, and the winner will soon pull far ahead of the pack of nations scrambling for the outdated pieces of technology left behind.</span></p>"}

{"title": "In Defense Of Jackson | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>To the Editors of The Crimson:</b></span></p> <p><span>In recent weeks we have noted with varying degrees of bemusement, disgust and indignation the continued attacks against the Reverend Jesse Jackson and his presidential campaign.  However, the inane babbling of self-styled political and moral analyst Michael W. Hirschorn has reached levels of racism and hypocrisy that we can no longer tolerate.</span></p> <p><span>Since Reverend Jackson apologized for the \"hymie\" remarks long ago, the incident should, at this point, be a dead issue.  That Hirschorn and others seem determined to beat to death the relatively insignificant \"hymie controversy\" is ample evidence of their own \"hypocrisy\" and \"racial demagoguery.\"  We are amazed that Ronald Reagan's terrorism against Third World peoples and Walter Mondale's high position in a corporation that invests in the oppressive South African regime have failed to disturb Hirschorn as much as Reverend Jackson's remarks have.  At worst, Reverend Jackson's words lead to hurt feelings, while the actions of Reagan and Mondale lead to genocide.</span></p> <p><span>The claim that an allegedly \"abysmal record\" on \"Black-Jewish relations\" nullifies the many laudable aspects of the Jackson campaign is both ludicrous and arrogant.  First, the existence of genuine \"Black-Jewish relations\" which Reverend Jackson could have damaged is simply an illusion from which we urge Hirschorn to free himself.  Furthermore, there can be no basis for any such relations as long as American Jews either defend, or silently condone.  Israel's role in buttressing the racist South African regime (See Noam Chomsky's <i>The Fateful Triangle</i>) Secondly, the recent tensions between Reverend Jackson and American Jews are of little importance to his campaign.  We challenge Hirschorn to deny that Reverend Jackson's attempts to talk to the PLO and his advocation of a Palestinian homeland had made a target for the animosity of most American Jews long before the 1984 presidential campaign.  Moreover, despite Hirschorn's presumptuous opinions, the American Jewish community is not, and never will be, so all-important that bad relations with it can nullify the positive aspects of a political campaign or any other endeavor.</span></p> <p><span>Like many white Americans, Hirschorn seems highly disturbed by the remarks of Minister Louis Farrakhan, and accuses him, ironically, of \"racial demagoguery.\"  Given the history of Blacks in this country, we find it mind-boggling that this term is used to describe a man who merely gave white Americans a long overdue warning that Blacks will no longer stand by and allow them to kill our leaders.  Indeed, Hirschorn and others who take exception to such a justified position are the true demagogues.</span></p> <p><span>The continued uproar over Minister Farrakhan's response to Milton Coleman's action has consistently remained afactual; Hirschorn's tirade, unfortunately, is no exception.  First, Milton Coleman admits to violating a confidence with Reverend Jackson--a confidence of the type that is common between reporters and political figures.  His only defense--which shows that he knew he did something wrong--was that Jackson had allegedly made this remark among other Black reporters.  However, on ABC's <i>Nightline,</i> one Black reporter, Kenneth Walker of ABC News, said that this \"simply is not true.\"</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the most deplorable aspect of Coleman's action was his utter insensitivity to the fact that breaking this confidence helped to accentuate the climate of danger that already surrounded Reverend Jackson.  Somehow Hirschorn and others consistently overlook this, while condemning the one alleged threat against Coleman's life, they remain silent about the more than one hundred death threats against Reverend Jackson (far greater than the number received by any other candidate), or the bombing of his headquarters in Anaheim, California by two whites.  We, like Minister Farrakhan, feel that Coleman or anyone who would so carelessly enhance such a climate of danger for a Black leader should be ostracized from the Black community.  Furthermore, we condemn as racist any whites who would dare judge the decisions of Blacks regarding the inclusion or ostracism of anyone from our community.</span></p> <p><span>We are also compelled to address Hirschorn's assertion that Reverend Jackson has created an \"almost absolute schism\" between Black and white voters.  Rather, we must address the simple, yet virulent racism that is the impetus behind this and other such grotesque examples of non-analysis.</span></p> <p><span>Only an arrogance stemming from the most vulgar strain of racism could allow Hirschorn to suggest that Reverend Jackson's candidacy has split Blacks and whites in this country.  In reality, there has been such a schism, created, nurtured and refined by whites since the first slave ship reached these shores in 1619.  What Reverend Jackson's candidacy has done is recognize this schism and provide an opportunity for Black voters to participate in, and, by so doing, transform, a political system which has this schism as a fundamental part of its foundation, and which, therefore, is itself morally bankrupt.</span></p> <p><span>As the product of a racist self-styled analyst, Hirschorn's tirade can be classified as an attempt to refine that schism.  By tying worthless praise of Reverend Jackson's to the contingency that he support the Democratic nominee, and by suggesting that the destruction of the two-primary system in the South will hurt Black voters by leading to the election of Southern Republicans, he glosses over the fact that historically, Southern Democrats have been the most overtly racist members of the U.S power elite.  Ultimately, it makes no real difference to the plight of Blacks in Mississippi if democrat John Stennis remains their senator of if some right-wing Republican oust him.  Indeed, they might well be better off with the Republican.  But by simplistically linking Blacks to a Democratic Party that has never adequately addressed their concerns, Hirschorn makes evident a political naivete and an utter ignorance of U.S. history that stems from an ugly and fundamental racism which debilitates his analytical skills.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, Hirschorn argues that Reverend Jackson's indictment of the racism of liberal whites smacks of opportunism and hypocrisy.  We note, however, that his nearly atrophied method of analysis is unable to address the fact that many liberal white voters, for some dark and secret reason, are indeed unable to support the presidential candidate who is most in tune with their own philosophy.  We would simply ask Hirschorn this:  Can Reverend Jackson be called an opportunist and a hypocrite for merely diagnosing yet another dynamic in white Americans that refines and widens the very schism Hirschorn supposedly deplores?</span></p> <p><span>In conclusion, we would assert that the issues of racial unity in general, and Black-Jewish relations in particular, pale in importance next to the opening of this nation's political structure to a segment of the population to which it has traditionally been closed.  We further contend that any analysis that attempts to reverse this order is hopelessly skewed and hopelessly racist. <b>Frederick C. Meten '85</b> \u00a0\u00a0<b>Stephen M.

It is filled with half truths and untruths, which could and should have been checked before publication.  The United States did not, as the articles suggest, use \"Micronesia\" as a test site \"for advanced nuclear weaponry.\"  A portion of the northern Marshall Islands, which itself is only a small portion of Micronesia, was indeed used for some years, ending in 1954, for nuclear tests.  By today's standards the tests were primitive, not advanced.  The article next implies that such tests are going on today, further raising body radiation counts among the effected people.  This is a total untruth, since none of the tests involved has anything to do with nuclear explosions.  Missiles fired into Kwajalein lagoon are unarmed and are retreived--one of the principal reasons for firing into the lagoon in the first place.  Extensive and repeated tests show conclusively that these tests do not raise radiation levels to any measurable degree--and indeed, they show that Kwajalein lagoon has a <i>lower</i> level of radiation than does the lagoon in Majaro, the Marshall's captial, when no such tests have ever taken place.</span></p> <p><span>I do not seek to justify nuclear testing, which can have serious adverse consequences I do suggest thast repeating wild and irresponsible charges about those consequences is bad journalism--and many of the charges which Darlene Keju Johnson and her husband have \tbeen peddling for years now to anyone gullible enough to believe them are indeed wild and irresponsible.  This includes, specifically, her standard \"jelly babies\" claim, for which she has yet to produce evidence despite repeated requests from US authorities that she do so.  Likewise, the incidence of physical disorders among the children and grandchildren of those effected by radiation is statistically virtually the same as that among similar unaffected Marshallese.</span></p> <p><span>The falsehoods abound.  At no time were foreign exchange and investment by non-Americans arbitrarily foreclosed.  Where is the footnote which cites the relevant Interior Department secretarial order?  Another totally unsupported assertion.</span></p> <p><span>Most important, however, the two articles ignore the remarkable program made by the Marshallese toward self-government, progress which notably fulfills the US obligation under the trusteeship.  The Marshallese have written a constitution and last fall carried out their secound national election.  They are almost entirely self-governing.  Their government negotiated and signed a compact of free association with the United States, which was opposed by 57 percent of the Marshallese voters in a UN-observed plebiscite last summer.  This compact makes extensive provisions for nuclear damages, reserving $150 million for this purpose.  The compact has been sent by President Reagan to Congress for enactment into law--and I would note that it is being supported vigorously by the Marshallese government.  The Chief Secretary of the Marshallese Cabinet, Oscar Debrum, is now in Washington for this purpose, as is the former Attorney General, Carl Ingram, who is a forum peace corps member now married to a Marshallese.  You can reach them at (202) 343-9143 if you care to take the trouble to get your facts straight.</span></p> <p><span>In sum, <i>The Crimson</i> printed an article based on a single, highly biased source, without bothering to check its contacts for accuracy.

Friends say Richardson never took pride in his role in the \"Saturday Night Massacre,\" and he disappointed many who wanted to make a hero of him by refusing to condemn Nixon.</span></p> <p><span>The Boston Observer, in a recent piece on Richardson, contends that he was a Nixon apologist until the bitter end.  The article quotes Nixon Administration staffer Charles Colson as saying of Richardson, \"When we needed somebody to say George McGovern was a scatterbrain, Elliot went right our and swatted him.\"</span></p> <p><span>Yet, friends--and aides say that Richardson's \"Saturday Night Massacre\" legacy is the one most firmly implanted in voters' minds, and the one that gives him credibility with Bay State independents and moderates.</span></p> <p><span>But Richardson himself notes that the Cox incident may hurt him in the nomination fight, especially with ultra-conservative party regulars.</span></p> <p><span>The candidate's relaxed confidence may have good cause.

{"title": "Space Cadet | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>F RONALD REAGAN gets his way the U.S. will soon embark on a costly and insane attempt to protect itself from nuclear attack with a vast array of space and earth-based lasers, particle beams, and missiles.</span></p> <p><span>This system, known as an ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) system, has been a favorite of the Administration ever since Reagan made his March 1983 \"star wars\" speech.  In his address the President held out the prospect of an America living secure in the knowledge that it \"could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies.</span></p> <p><span>The Administration hopes to spend almost two billion dollars researching an ABM system next year.  It envisions a five year program that will spend twenty four billion dollars by 1989 determining whether the concept is feasible.  Recent studies indicate that the cost of constructing and adequate shield within twenty years would be $250-$500 billion.</span></p> <p><span>The rationale for spending this enormous amount of money is alluring.  If the U.S. could successfully defend itself against nuclear attack the nuclear dilemma would be radically altered.  The need to threaten mass destruction to deter attackers would disappear Peace would cease to depend on the sanity and stability of our enemies Americans would no longer have to live with the knowledge that they, their families and their civilization could be blotted out in an instant.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately a feasible ABM system remains a dream.  It is the modern-day version of the French Maginot line--a large and expensive shield that will give us the illusion of safety, but will fail us should the final crisis ever come.  Even the attempt to erect a ballistic missile defense will prove disastrous to national security.  If we press ahead with Reagan's \"star wars\" concept, we will alienate our allies, spark a new arms race, and waste billions of dollars that could be better spent on conventional defense or social programs.</span></p> <p><span>If the Administration pushes ahead on an ABM system, not only will it waste a huge slice of the nation's wealth, but it will also break one of the most successful arms control agreements in history:  the ABM section of the 1972 SALT I treaty.  Recent evidence indicating that the Soviets have violated certain provisions of the treaty still gives no justification for a complete US abrogation.  Arms control agreements are few and far between in our conflict-ridden world.  They provide a major source of stability at a time when U.S. U.S.S.R. relations are at a new low.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>FCOURSE, it makes little sense to support arms control agreements merely for their own sake.  Breaking the ABM treaty, however, will have an immediate and adverse impact on the unity of the Western alliance.  The deployment of Euromissiles last fall was enough to bring out hundreds of thousands of demonstrators.  How will Europeans respond to a unilateral American abrogation of one of the most successful arms accords ever negotiated?</span></p> <p><span>Even Europeans who dislike pacifists, fear Reagan's \"star wars\" push.  Hardliners such as Franz Josef Strauss, the leader of Germany's conservative wing, have protested America's plans.  These Europeans worry that strategic defensive systems would \"de-couple\" the U.S. from Europe.  If the superpowers were to develop a workable ABM system--a big if--then the American nuclear guarantee would no longer be credible.  The Russians could invade Europe without having to worry about an American intercontinental nuclear response.</span></p> <p><span>But the \"star wars\" approach to nuclear weapons shouldn't scare only the Europeans.  It would deeply exacerbate the arms race, and make everyone more insecure.  Proponents of an ABM system argue that it would actually enhance arms control--first, by giving each side enough security to negotiate deep force reductions, and second, by reducing each side's fear of a preemptive strike.  Developing ABM capabilities would supposedly change the arms race into a \"defense race.\"</span></p> <p><span>This reasoning couldn't be more specious.  When two men are pointing guns at each other, they are hardly likely to consider it defensive when one of them starts edging behind a pillar.  The benefits that a \"star wars\" defense could bring exist only if the system is already in place and works.</span></p> <p><span>Yet getting behind the pillar will take us at least twenty years.  In the meantime, a full-fledged space race will develop, in which each side seeks supremacy in technological areas that would be vital to any ballistic missile defense.  And while the U.S. may hold a temporary lead in space technology, it is also vastly more dependent than Russia on satellites for communications and reconnaissance because of its wide-flung network of submarines, bomber bases, and other defense installations.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>N EVEN MORE practical and immediate objection to the porposed system lies in the complex technology required.  Even if only ten warheads breached our shield, they would wreak destruction on a scale never before witnessed by man.  Yet in a full-scale attack, ten thousand warheads would be launched.  They would come from all directions at the same time and at high speed.  To stop every one would require, as a recent <i>Foreign Affairs</i> article by William E. Burrows points out, \"a defensive system able to react with almost unbelievable speed and flawless lethality...\"</span></p> <p><span>To build such a system even in the absence of a Soviet response would be a daunting task.  However, as many years as we take to develop an ABM system, the Soviets will use to think up a means of circumventing it.  Every proposed version of the \"star wars\" shield has an easily exploited weakness.  The Russians could preemptively attack laser satellites.  They could confuse tracking systems with thousands of decoy rockets.  They could fire submarine-based missiles on low trajectories which couldn't be spotted.  Of course, we might be able to solve some of these problems.  But the Russians would have a continuous incentive to think up new ones, and we could never be sure that our system actually worked.</span></p> <p><span>Ronald Reagan's ballistic missile merry-go-round simply isn't worth the cost.  The President wants us to pursue the mirage of absolute security in an age when weapons of mass destruction make such security impossible.  Only myopic could lead us to break a successful arms accord, destroy our European alliance, and spark an arms race for the sake of a new Maginot line which would never work.  Spending tens of billions of dollars researching a fatally flawed idea, and perhaps hundreds of billions implementing it would indeed require blindness on a national scale.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Flip Flop | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>T IS BECOMING something of a <i>sino qua non</i> for a commie-baiting President seeking reelection to stage a carefully timed pre-election love-in with the Chinese.  Ronald Reagan is trying to recapture the effect Richard M. Nixon made when he became the first U.S. premier to pay his respects to our One Billion Red brothers, and this week's trip should be replete with pathetic scenes of inter-ideological friendship, numerous pictures of Nancy and Ronald deftly maneuvering their chopsticks over bowls of rice and chop suey, and enough symbolism to make even TV executives retch.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan will forget he has made a blood oath to wipe communism from the face of the earth, and both he and Chinese Premier Deng Xiaoping will carefully ignore Taiwan--the most sticky issue in Sino-American relations.  Reagan, who for three years showed a decided preference for China's small capitalist would-be namesake, now gingerly talks of relations with the \"people of Taiwan,\" but not Taiwan itself.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan does have the chance to make some real progress, especially in pushing to step up economic and strategic cooperation with the Chinese.  If only out of enlighened self-interest, Reagan should stress creating at least a limited common front against the Soviets.  The question is whether Reagan will remember anything he said this week after he returns across the Pacific.  We of course welcome friendly relations with the world's most populous country, but, coming after a period of chilly rhetoric by the Americans, the sudden friendship does not ring true.  Why the flip-flop?</span></p> <p><span>Answer:  The China trip is almost exclusively for home consumption, and the Administration is hoping Reagan can use the publicity to divert attention from his latest foreign policy disasters in Lebanon and Central America, Congress complete repudiation of the Reagan FY85 budget, and growing public awareness of Administration sleaziness.</span></p> <p><span>Many in Washington have drawn the obvious parallel to the 1972 election.  Superficially, the analogy holds.  Reagan, like Nixon, is a popular incumbent playing footsie with Third World crises, playing hardball with the Soviets, and playing around with ethics behind closed doors.  The Democrats, as in 1972, are tearing themselves to shreds in the nomination fight.  The incumbent will play off Democratic discord and win handily through some deft international diplomacy and a thinly disguised call for a return to a pre-polymorphic America.</span></p> <p><span>This scenario will hold unless voters and the media do not fall in line with Reagans double talk with the same equanimity with which they accepted the Grenada invasion.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan's China trip is but another chapter in his how-to book on leadership by image manipulation.  The President survives a bomb attack in Lebanon by invading Grenada, tempers anti-interventionist sentiment in El Salvador by staging marginally democratic election there, and turns the tables on criticism of his terrorist policies in Nicaragua by announcing a stepped-up anti-terrorist policy himself.  Now China, but if you close your eyes, you can make it go away.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Backing Alfonsin | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b>FTER a half century of virtually uninterrupted military rule, a hint of democracy has finally penetrated Argentina's totalitarian armor President Raul Alfonsin's government, succeeding a brutal military regime, offers many Argentines what it ought to offer the Reagan Administration a chance to make a Latin American nation survive and prosper And, perhaps more importantly for the U.S. Alfonsin has given the Administration a plum chance to put its money where its mouth to really work for liberty and justice.</span></p> <p><span>Whether or not Argentina again turns its back on democracy may in large part be determined by what the United States does to help Alfonsin.  Only if Alfonsin is able to solve his country's problems can he prove that democracy can succeed where dictatorship has failed.  The new president has to overcome some serious obstacles first.  Inflation runs at annual rate of 1000 percent, the foreign debt stands at $40 billion, unemployment is over 20 percent, while underemployment (the number of people who work no more than one hour each day) has reached 30 percent.  But the situation is not hopeless.  Argentina has enough oil alone to power all of its industry and can feed a population 28 times its size.  Its detoriorating economy is largely a result of a decade without economic growth, caused by 50 years of inept military rule (Since the '30s all but eight of 24 Argentine presidents have been military leaders).  Before the military took over running the economy, Argentina had a GNP twice the size of Italy's and a mere $30 less than that of France.  Now it is considered a Third World country.</span></p> <p><span>Alfonsin has already proven himself more than worthy of unfailing United States aid.  He has placed the army under civilian authority and is reducing the size of the armed forces.  He has also abandoned the American tactic of supporting secret wars to overthrow existing Latin American governments, and has promised to peacefully resolve a potentially fractious conflict with Chile over the Beagle Channel.</span></p> <p><span>Alfonsin claims that United States aid is crucial to the success of his policies and his administration.  It is vital that American markets be opened to Argentine goods if the country is to grow at all.  Realizing that only if the debtor is allowed to do business will the creditor collect, Alfonsin is willing to implement an austerity program, but not a recessionary one.</span></p> <p><span><b>U</b>NFORTUNATELY, the Reagan Administration has not taken the bait.  Recently, Argentina's IMF loans fell due and the country was incapable of paying them.  The United States finally showed a modicum of support and gave Argentina money, but only after Mexico had taken the lead.</span></p> <p><span>What little attention the U.S. has paid, has been to use the country as a military pawn.  To avoid Congressional disapproval over covert military actions in Nicaragua, Reagan requested that the then-Argentina military junta and train anti-Sandinista guerilla to attack from bases in Honderas.  The Argentines agreed.  But when the country tried to claim the Falkland Islands, America not only dropped its pawn like a hot potato, but supported Britain in the war.  Mislead by Reagan, and by their own political naivete, Argentine leaders believed themselves wholeheartedly supported by the United States, an assumption which proved wholeheartedly wrong.</span></p> <p><span>After the war, when the military, showing signs of postwar exhaustion, announced that it would return power to the civilians, the United States tried to resume arms sales in the summer of 1982 to win back Argentine good will (Arms sales had been prohibited in 1978 because of human rights violations).  It was supposedly a measure of good faith, but it seemed to indicate that the United States had no faith in democracy and that the military was expected to play an important political role in the years to come.  Congress thankfully blocked the arms sales, but the blunders continued.  Embassy officials criticized human rights workers, explaining that a Peronist victory would best serve American interests.  In November, just one month after Alfonsin's election, Robert Schweitzer, an official with the Inter-American Defense Board, slipped into Argentina to meet with top military officials, without telling the new leaders.  This enraged Alfonsin--and rightly so--enough that the United States lifted the arms ban, for lack of anything better to do.  But the move was too late.</span></p> <p><span>If the Reagan Administration wishes to beef up Argentina's military prowess by strengthening its arsenal, there should be no strenuous objections.  But what the United States must first, and more importantly, do is to show explicit and active support for Alfonsin's attempts to democratize the country.  Open commitment to human rights and economic growth in Argentina must replace the \"quiet diplomacy\" which has thus far served only to alienate and distance the Reagan Administration from Alfonsin if the United States considers a Latin American ally a priority at all.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Road to Pantasma | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The Reagan Administration has convinced the Republican-controlled Senate of the legitimacy of its request for $21 million for anti-Sandinista rebels based in Honduras.  The President might also succeed in winning House approval--in defiance of Speaker O'Neill's political will--unless opponents, including private citizens, can show a more complete picture of violence by recipients of this aid.  Very few details have been revealed about the CIA supported forces, known in Nicaragua as \"Contras.\"  Many are former Nicaraguan national Guardsmen, whom President Reagan extolls as \"freedom fighters.\"  This respectful characterization, however, has no basis in fact.</span></p> <p><span>The true character of the Contras was made painfully clear to members of my fact-finding group during a visit to the Nicaraguan village of Pantasma.  Our journey began early Sunday morning January '15.  The trek from Maltagalpu to the northeast province of Jinotega, took over three hours.  As a driven rain fell.  Oscar, our driver, skillfully maneuvered the bus along winding mountain roads.  Armed peasants waved as we passed, and we questioned the kind of existence where people are forced to shoulder rifles while tending their fields and cattles.  The booming voice of our escort--a campesino--explained that the bridge we were crossing had been blown-up five times by counter-revolutionaries.</span></p> <p><span>During a security check at Mancotal--a strategic dam on the road to Pantasma--a boy-FSLN militiaman poked his head in to the doorway of the bus and smiled.  In peacetime, he and thousands of other Nicaraguan youths might be playing soccer or baseball, but our government's backing of the Contras, makes this vision of childhood, especially for those who live close to the Honduran border, virtually impossible.</span></p> <p><span>By late morning we emerged from low lying clouds that hung tenaciously to the lush mountain.  We began a slow descent into the valley, surrounded by rows of corn, tobacco and coffee fields.  Moments later we entered Pantasma.  Thick forests stretched boundlessly.  Through the lens of a MimiyaZE, it was a breathtaking experience, but for the inhabitants of Pantasma, the fertile forests and mountains of the region are the sites of kidnappings, ambushes and other wartime cruelties.</span></p> <p><span>The worst act of terror occurred on October 18, 1983 when 250 to 300 Contras poured from the woods and launched an early morning attack on the sleeping village.  Forty-seven people were massacred.  The raiders set fire to the local agricultural cooperatives, the coffee storage office, the territorial and police militia posts, and cars and trucks used to build roads.  After sacking a branch of the National Development Bank, they destroyed it, reportedly using American RP7 grenade launchers.</span></p> <p><span>We stepped from the bus to examine the hull of the bank's burnt-out structure, which peasant and student volunteers were reconstructing.  An International Harvester tractor rusted beside several new Russian counterparts.  An elder bystander complained to me that he preferred the U.S. machine, but that Ronald Reagan blocks their import.  I could not help but wonder how laid-off International Harvester workers in Rock Island.  Illinois or Fort Wayne, Indiana would react if they were aware of this wasted opportunity.</span></p> <p><span>Further down the road we surveyed the remains of a modern, privately owned lumber mill.  Two small children played among the metallic ruins, as our escort explained how their fathers, and dozens of others, were left without jobs as a result of the Contra attack.</span></p> <p><span>The full impact of the October 18th massacre was clear when we reached a school that was converted into a refugee center.  Schools symbolize a key objective of the Nicaraguan Revolution.  One of the first acts of the new Sandinista government following its victory over Somoza in 1979, was to launch a campaign to educate the country's illiterate, who then comprised 51 percent of the nation.  A handful of the 185,000 young teaching volunteers from Managus and other cities went to Pantasma.  Many of their students became teachers themselves.  They were the first to die at the hands of the Contras.  Some of them were beheaded, to serve as examples to others.  \"Their crime?  The crime of these teachers is that they were trying to get people out of their illiteracy situation, which was inherited from the Somocista dictatorship,\" said Almado Felipe Guittieretz, one of three out of a total of 10 militiamen who survived the day long attack.</span></p> <p><span>In the one room school house, he addressed a group of strangers, and dozens of noisy children and weeping widows.  After some urging, several of the women solemnly stepped forward to relate their personal tragedies.  Others turned their backs to us and cried uncontrollably, even though the object of their grief occurred four months prior to our arrival.  All of the women testified to having been \"humiliated\" or raped by the Contras.  Trinidad Garcia de Castro, standing with her children by her side, said that her 14 year old sister, a teacher, was kidnapped by the invaders from Honduras, 40 kilometers to the north.  She did not expect to see her again.  Her biggest loss, she said, was the murder of her father.</span></p> <p><span>\"My father was 57 years old,\" she said.  \"They killed my father because he grabbed his gun to defend us.  We had taken refuge--myself, the women who's standing near me, my two children and a small child.  My father had been injured in one leg, so he came and sought refuge with us, but the Contras came and took him away...He could not defend himself.  He could not even walk.  They hit the children...with their guns.  They didn't even let the old man kiss his children.  In front of the children they stood him up and shot him...They shot him in the mouth and the bullets came out from his brain.\"</span></p> <p><span><i>Phillip W.D.

Like a modern-day Carry Nation, she intends to shut down America's dens of depravity MacKinnon's targets, however, are not the Piccadilly Filly or the Boathouse, but Nini's Corner and Out of Town News Katherine MacKinnon wants to make the world safe for America's women by closing down shops that sell smut.</span></p> <p><span>MacKinnon, a University of Minnesota law professor and a recent speaker at the Law School, co-sponsored a Minneapolis municipal ordinance with feminist writer Andrea Dworkin that defines pornography as a violation of a woman's civil rights.  This bill, which was vetoed by the Mayor, would have allowed anyone to sue the creators and distributors of pornography for damages, effectively putting them out of business.</span></p> <p><span>The Dworkin-MacKinnon ordinance is part of a recent trend among feminists, who are critical of pornography and its effects on society's perception of women.  Feminists like Dworkin contend that the portrayal of women as submissive sexual objects promotes a degrading attitude toward women that in turn leads to sexual discrimination, harassment, abuse, and rape.  They have written articles, staged marches, and given speeches advocating the banning of obscene material because of its damaging effects on women.</span></p> <p><span>And on May 1 the city of Indianapolis, with the aid of anti-obscenity activists from Minneapolis, drafted and passed an ordinance similar to MacKinnon and Dworkin's.  It was immediately stayed by a Federal District Court judge, and further arguments on the ordinance's constitutionality are pending.</span></p> <p><span>But the contentions of these activists rest upon two shaky assumptions.  The first is that pornography directly fosters a sexist or aggressive attitude towards women.  Studies have attempted to demonstrate this, but the most they have been able to show is a correlation between these attitudes and pornography.  Some have pointed out that the increasing availability of pornography has coincided, with a large increase in sexual assaults.  But most experts believe that rapes were grossly under-reported in the past, so the real increase in the number of assaults can only be guessed at.  Furthermore, the role of pornography is not well understood; it' may act as a safety valve as well as a model for sexual aggression.  Blaming rape on the prevalence of pornography is simplistic, and it may not be borne out by the facts.</span></p> <p><span>The second assumption is that some workable definition of pornography can be found.  The courts have had enormous difficulty trying to define what is and is not pornographic.  In order to meet the criterion of specificity that the Supreme Court demands of a statute, the MacKinnon-Dworkin bill committed the sin of ridiculousness.  Under the proposed ordinance, any work that portrays women \"who are tied up or cut up or mutilated or bruised or physically hurt\" or that shows women as \"filthy or inferior\" qualifies as pornography.  Out goes <i>A Clockwork Orange, Gone with the Wind,</i> and almost every action film ever made.  When MacKinnon was asked whether the bill was overly broad, she replied.  \"Tell us how to make it better.\"  This statement effectively sums up the problem of subjectivity.  Smut is in the eye of the beholder; it is difficult, if not impossible, to set an objective standard.</span></p> <p><span><b>E</b>VEN SETTING ASIDE these objections, however, MacKinnon's proposal still founders on several key points.  Pornography may contribute to an attitude conducive to sexual harassment and rape, but the same has been about suggestive advertising.  And why limit a campaign against violence to that committed against women?

{"title": "The Joy of Capitalism | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>D</b>EVELOPMNET ECONOMICS is a faddish field.  While other practitioners of the dismal science study the herd mentality, development economists practice it.  But despite many voices, consensus is hard to come by.  The field's single universally accepted truth may well be the assertion that despite 35 years of attention, the problems of the Third World seem as intractable as ever.  But in this mercurial field.  P. T. Bauer has remained an academic constant.</span></p> <p><span>Bauer is the field's iconoclast.  For more than two decades he has provided a counterpoint to whatever tune others in his discipline happen to be playing.  In his latest work, Reality and Rhetoric he goes back to grinding his familiar over the belief that the Third World's problems can be solved by a return to the free market.</span></p> <p><span>This trip down the memory lane of neo-classical economics has several elements.  First Bauer writes, the rote of government in economic hie must be reduced.  Prosperity will be created by the free enterprise system, \"in which firms and individuals largely determine what is produced and consumed.\"  Bauer also promotes the ideal of comparative advantage, the concept that nations should produce what they can make most cheaply.  For most poor nations this means exporting raw materials and agricultural products.  Bauer deems the idea of Third World industrialization inefficient and declares that it is \"more likely to retard economic development than to promote it.\"</span></p> <p><span>The solution to Third World problems suggested by Bauer represents a unique vision of less developed nations.  While most development thinkers regard the effects of economic relations between rich and poor nations as a mixed bag, Bauer views the role of trade through rose-colored glasses.  For him, the Third World ought to be thankful for the role the West has played in pulling it out of the stone age.  He dismisses foreign aid by rich nations as guilt offerings for a crime they did not commit, and characterizes Third World groups generally as parasites organized to such dry their former colonial masters.  This and is used Bauer writes, to lengthen the time poor nations can spend in economic fantasyland, unaware of the ruinous consequences of their socialistic policies.</span></p> <p><span>The 10 essays in <b>Reality and Rhetoric</b> are full of promises of doom should the Third World continue on its present course.  But Bauer's failure is that he never displays a full under standing of why these countries act the way that they do now, and whey an economic logic stronger than Bauer's prevents them from changing course as radically as he proposes.</span></p> <p><span>For example, in an essay on Niggrlan development, Bauer denies the need for poorer nations to industrialize.  This is in agreement with the classical economic view that a nation should do what it is best at.  But Bauer's recommendation suggests that Third World nations join a system rigged against them.  Much like American farmers.  Third World nations find the prices they receive for their products seldom keep pace with the prices of the things they must buy to satisfy their populations.  They export items whose prices are largely dictated to them by richer industrial powers.  The only group of exporters who were for a time, able to escape from this trap was the OPPC nations, who used monopolistic practices that a free-market Tan like Bauer would surely not encourage.  Bauer's idea is Hawed in another way as well it assumes that nations which are most efficient in producing a given good today till continue to be most efficient.  If Japan, for example, had adopted this idea after World War II, the names Toyota, Sony and Nikon might be a bit less meaningful today.</span></p> <p><span>Bauer also refuses to acknowledge, that his economic policies could have unfortunate social consequences.  Nations which have followed the agricultural product or raw-material based path that he advocates have often found themselves with repressive political systems needed to maintain societies in which there are few rich and many poor.  Overly careful adherence to Adam Smith often Produces Anastasia Somoza.</span></p> <p><span>But the most pernicious aspect of <b>Reality and Rhetoric is Bauer's view of culture.</b>  The process of development he indicates requires that poorer nations surrender their culture and accept that of the West.  This treatment of one of the major non-economic issues of development is cavalier at best.  Whereas for Bauer culture may mean nothing more than the ability to accept capitalism others have a richer conception of it.</span></p> <p><span>His chauvinism is particularly evident in his discussion of the importance of ethnic discussion of the importance of ethnic minorities in African development While it would be difficult to understate the role prayed by groups such as the Lebanese in the poor nations of West Africa, the praise that Bauer heaps on these successful businessmen reveals that his view of culture extends to little more than the ability to turn a profit.</span></p> <p><span>What Bauer offers is Reaganomics for the Third World, with all the simplistic faith in market solutions of its American relative.  But no one is quite so arrogant as to suggest that there is nobody starring in Africa or Latin America in nations where so many people live at the brink of subsistence, there is little patience with policies which endorse present suffering for a rosier future.  In the short run, many may die.</span></p> <p><span>While Bauer points out many.  Third problems he tails to convince the reader that his solutions are better than anyone else's.  Along the way his faulty analysis underscores the weaknesses of narrow.  Purely economic approach to the problems of the Third World.  Bauer's analysis ultimately does not use above the level of verbiage in a field long on words but short on solutions.  P. T. Bauer is happy to be a voice in the wilderness.  Now if only he would top howling.</span></p>"}

Julia Riechert and James Klein unearthed questions about the Communist Party in America that they felt compelled to answer.  Reichert and Klein began to chip away at the wall built during the McCarthy era which segregated, or some would say protected, American society from communists.  They did not find what they expected--malicious communist spies in long trench coats, or \"Rats,\" as they were described by Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon.  But they did find Americans they could emulate.  With archival films and the clippings of more than 400 interviews, Riechert and Klein creatively reconstructed their discoveries in the Academy-Award nominated documentary <i>Seeing Red,</i> an intellectually stimulating and compassionate portrayal of American communists.</span></p> <p><span><i>Seeing Red</i> reveals a history of the Communist party in America long obscured by the Red Scare.  In the 1930s Communists stood at the front of the picket lines for unions, unemployment insurance, Social Security and civil rights.  Although responsible for much social and political change, communists never revealed their alliance to the Party.  They could lose their jobs and all of their gains as organizers and union leaders if people knew their politics.  Nevertheless, they worked on, steadily recruiting and organizing strikes.  They believed in a methodology that would make the American Dream a reality.</span></p> <p><span>The Communists of the 1930s as portrayed in <i>Seeing Red</i> were not spies.  In their youth they became overwhelmed by discrimination and the disgraceful living and working conditions in the fields and slums all over the country; the disparity between the rich and the poor moved these Americans to action.  Told that in Russia there was no discrimination, no poverty, and total equality, they adopted the communist country as their living model, accepting it book, line and sinker.</span></p> <p><span>\"They had a blind spot,\" says Reichert.  \"Unfortunately they bought into a model without questioning it.  It became their first principle to defend that country.\"  So much so that they didn't believe reports of the Stalin purges.  When the Stalin revelations became news in 1956 many of the communists became so disillusioned that they dropped out of the party.  They grew more concerned with democracy.  It was an ideal that many would have never dreamed of giving up.</span></p> <p><span>The communists who appear in <i>Seeing Red</i> present a message to Americans that they never explicitly recognized or addressed.  According to Riechert, \"They were fighting for an American democracy.  They were very democratic and militant.  They can be seen as models for members of a type of active democracy that we need today.  We've learned from them the need to keep a questioning mind, not an uncommitted mind.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>EEING RED makes it obvious that its main characters could be our neighbors or even our relatives.  But in removing the stereotypical connotations of the word \"communist,\" the movie refrains from exposing many flaws of the communist movement.  Klein explains, \"We felt it was more important to convey to the audience on a broad, conceptual level, what we felt were the most basic flaws of the communist movement, rather than each and every specific historic moment when it may have gone wrong.\"</span></p> <p><span>Pete Seeger, one of the most memorable people in the documentary, reflects on his experience as a communist with this remark:  \"If you're going to mourn don't mourn for a fighter who made a mistake and lost.\"  <i>Seeing Red</i> all but praises.  Like <i>The Good Fight,</i> which tells the story of the Lincoln Brigade, it presents a history of America on film unavailable in any other medium.  <i>Seeing Red</i> is a comprehensive study of American Communists that allows one to meet the ideology of communism through the once youthful eyes of those who saw an America below their standards and strove to do something about it.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Lost in the Fog | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>E</b>VER SINCE he took office, President Reagan has been criticized for the overly relaxed manner in which he approaches his job.  Opposing politicians and common taxpayers alike have grumbled about his frequent long vacations and his 9-5 Presidency.</span></p> <p><span>But make no mistake about it.  Reagan is devoted to the job.  He loves being President--which is just fine.  But the sad truth is that his view of what exactly the man in the oval office should be doing is different from most people's.  He sees himself as an elder statesman, a philosophical grandfather-figure too elevated to bother himself with details like facts and programs.</span></p> <p><span>To foster this image.  Reagan has learned to defuse media criticism.  He is better at manipulating the press than any of his predecessors, including Kennedy.  He learns his lines well for press conferences and folksily calls the reporters by their first names.  His anecdote-filled speeches are lulling political Muzak But when forced to think on his feet and answer questions off the cuff, he fails miserably.</span></p> <p><span>Three weeks after Reagan took office a <i>Crimson</i> reporter had the first exclusive interview with the new President.  Paul M. Barrett '82 observed afterwards that Reagan \"is anything but the man with all the facts in his head and a them.\"  An interview printed last week in <i>The New York Times</i> shows that in three years nothing has changed.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan's words are almost incomprehensible.  He rambles and backtracks and says little that means anything.  When asked about the huge federal deficit, Reagan said:</span></p> <p><span>I think the basic part of the deficit is due to government itself and the excessive share of the people's earnings, the gross national product, the government is taking.  And so we're going to continue.  We made a proposal for the down payment in the next three years, so it's pretty evenly divided between some revenues, not by raising rates but by eliminating some tax practices that we think aren't fairly distributed.</span></p> <p><span>The response--preceded by a diatribe against deficits--is nothing but gobbledygook.  It seems he is saying the budget deficit is due to the government taking in too much money and the way to fix it is eliminating even more taxes.</span></p> <p><span>True, the <i>Times'</i> transcript is cruel; it left out nothing save the pauses and stumbles.  But it is important for the public to see just how foggy the President really is.</span></p> <p><span>In the next question the reporters asked Reagan to elaborate on a passing remark he had made about the need to restructure.  Social Security.  He couldn't.  It will take months or years of study for the government to figure out what to do about the entitlement programs, and the President hasn't a clue what to expect.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan is so inept at responding to questions without knowing the issues or the facts that his aides have tried desperately to prevent reporters from catching him unprepared; they have virtually banned questions during informal sessions.</span></p> <p><span>The second half of the <i>Times</i> interview dealt with more philosophical questions about the Middle, East and Reagan did a lot better.  His train of thought is still hard to follow but he could wax lyrical about the good guys and the bad guys and avoid getting tripped up by the facts.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T MAY SEEM petty to harp on how Reagan looks in a verbatim transcript.  Most people's everyday speech would look atrocious transcribed word for word.  But the content made no more sense than the phrasing; Reagan, was being asked to explain his views on specific issues and he should be able to communicate ideas, if not a fact or two as well.</span></p> <p><span>Politicians and journalists alike have complained for three years that he consistently avoids specific issues and talks in misty parables or tells old Hollywood stories.  Done with style and humor, this is an acceptable method of diverting a tough or unfair question from a reporter.  Among colleagues, however, it is simply inappropriate.</span></p> <p><span>The inescapable conclusion is that Reagan simply isn't all that bright and doesn't do his homework.  The number of complex issues the President is faced with is staggering, but simply to farm out the needed thinking to staff members, as Reagan does, is wrong.  The President is ultimately responsible and the realization that he is so foggy on the issues, no matter how competent his advisers are, is frightening.  How can we have coherent and decisive government when the man in charge is caught in the mist?</span></p>"}
{"title": "Compelling Facts | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>B</b>EE DUNG</span></p> <p><span>The idea sounds prima facie absurd, which is exactly what the government would have us believe about the latest theory advanced for explaining the phenomenon of yellow rain.  The government says the stuff is caused by Soviet chemical warfare in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan which, if true, is an egregious violation of international norms and several existing treaties.</span></p> <p><span>But Harvard Professor Matthew S. Meselson is persisting in his claim that yellow rain is instead the feces of wild honeybees.  Bee feces, Meselson and a Yale colleague have found, bear strong resemblances--in size, appearance, and characteristics--to alleged samples of yellow rain, many of which in fact contained pollen.  Now back from a trip to Thailand, the scientists say they observed honey bees on defecation flights spraying the yellow spots that the government says are the residue of Soviet chemical weapons.</span></p> <p><span>With no airtight scientific evidence available to prove the issue on either side, scientists and bureaucrats rush to back what seems most plausible or, some claim, what seems most politically comfortable.  But the available evidence, Meselson's claims notwithstanding, appears to favor the government's contentions.</span></p> <p><span>Meselson, a principled opponent of chemical warfare of longstanding, ought to be congratulated for his courageous pursuit of his bee hypothesis in face of ridicule and intransigency by the government.  Still, his explanation for the yellow rain phenomenon answers only one part of the broad array of evidence collected by the government to back its claims.</span></p> <p><span>Classified technical data indicates that the Soviets are involved with the development of chemical weapons.  Hundreds of firsthand reports exist from refugees claiming to be the victims of yellow rain.  Samples taken from alleged attack sites have been studied under laboratories and shown to contain toxins far in excels of what is normally found in Asia; these include samples of rocks, leaves, and blood and urine from alleged victims that <i>do not</i> contain the famous yellow spots Meselson says now are bee feces.</span></p> <p><span>Meselson has doubts about each of these points, and offers possible alternative explanations.  The scientific survey of samples of yellow rain and toxins weren't good enough, he says.  He suggests that refugee reports are unreliable.</span></p> <p><span>The burden of proof must always lie with the government when it makes such charges of international gravity.  But Meselson's position only appears convincing if he is given the benefit of the doubt on each separate point--a dubious proposition at best.</span></p> <p><span>Refugees' reports, for instance, are often dismissed as unreliable.  But, as even Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.), an authority on Asia and trenchant critic of the Administration, has pointed out, this contempt is ill founded.  Refugees ranging from the Jews fleeing Nazi Germany to Cambodians fleeing Pol Pot carried the truth about the regimes they were fleeing, though it was initially dismissed.  Solarz writes, \"It strains credulity to believe that the refugees escaping \"yellow rain\" in Asia, alone among the victims of repression, are engaged in a monumental hoax.\"</span></p> <p><span>When the United States first charged the Soviets with breaking treaties banning chemical weapons, many might have believed it to be just another example of the Reagan Administration's excessive communist paranoia.  But numerous other governments, scientists, and liberal officials like Solarz, have joined the chorus of denunciation, and the available evidence--at least to the layman--seems compelling that the Soviets are up to no good.</span></p> <p><span>Meselson says he will contine to press his investigation of the alleged chemical warfare and expresses confidence that the government story will eventually unravel.  If indeed the State Department acted too hastily, it should move quickly to retract its charges and withstand the opprobrium it is sure to receive.</span></p> <p><span>At the same time however, with reports filtering in that Iraq is using mustard gas in its battle with Iran, the world has not a moment to lose in redoubling its fight against chemical warfare, one of the most truly despicable forms of war there is.  The most potent threat to this effort is complacency, an attitude that is heightened by current doubts and uncertainties about the government position.</span></p> <p><span>This is why the government must further experiment and investigate the issue in order to convince skeptics like Meselson.  The evidence may be compelling.  But pragmatically speaking, only with a united front one the United States and other countries bring enough pressure to bear on the Soviets to stop flouting international law and morality.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Big Picture | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>HILE WE AGREE with the majority opinion against chemical warfare, we find their lack of perspective disturbing.  Most certainly Meselson's findings are insufficient but determining Soviet guilt should not be the focus of debate.  Rather, as concerned Americans citizens, our attention ought to be focused on the issue of chemical warfare as a worldwide concern rather than an East-West moral rivalry.  Too often, it seems, the Soviets are made to seem the scapegoat--especially when abuses are prevalent at home.</span></p> <p><span>The majority cites the Iraqi use of chemical warfare as a example of Soviet law-breaking and calls for a united front, presumably made up of Western nations, to oppose Soviet activity.  But such a united front would have to exclude West Germany, the country that sold the weapons to Iraq.  It would also have to exclude the United States; especially when President Reagan dares to speak of a worldwide ban on chemical warfare testing production and possession while mentioning the need for \"limited retaliatory capability\" for the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>Although Congress last year voted down a Reagan appeal to begin reexamining the potential of chemical weapons, it is unlikely that Reagan will stop his push for chemical weaponry.</span></p> <p><span>Such cries for East-West confrontationalism are unsettling; before calling for a \"united front\" including the United States and other countries to bring \"pressure to bear on the Soviets,\" we feel that policing should start at home.

Turner that seemed to he a direct challenge to Shannon's reputation as an \"insider\" who doesn't arouse the publicity someone like Markey does, said he would bring \"tough policy making to the Senate.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I think defeating Reagan is God's work,\" said Shannon \"but there's a chance he'll be re-elected President.  If he is, you're going to need people in the Senato who aren't satisfied to just sit there and point the finger of blame.  They'll have to work nine-of-five to change the policies of this country.\"</span></p> <p><span>This was the first debate since the already-infamous WBZ-TV interviews last week in which some of the candidates could not answer questions such as \"Who is Israel's prime minister?\"  and \"Whom does the U.S. support in Nicaragua and El Salvador?\"  Turner asked Bartley, who was embarrassed when he could not answer any of the four questions on last Monday's broadcast, what he thought of the questions' \"fairness.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I suppose it was a fair test,\" responded Bartley.  \"Voters expect a certain amount of knowledge on these issues.

He further goes on to claim that removing American military forces from Central American will jeopardize stability in that region.</span></p> <p><span>Jebsen recognizes that the problem in El Salvador is one of \"economic and political fairness.\"  Yet somehow he feels that these problems can best be addressed through military solutions.  Propping up the current authoritarian regime in El Salvador will only create bloodshed, not fairness.</span></p> <p><span>The fact that elections were held on March 25 does not mean that El Salvador has become a democracy.  Jebsen cites high turnout as proof that these were \"true\" elections.  I wonder if Mr. Jebsen thinks that the Soviet Union with its 99% voter turnout is a democracy?  His response would probably be no, because opposition parties are excluded from the electoral process.  Yet in El Salvador, Jebsen admits that the Social Democrats were, if not legally, certainly practically excluded from the elections by fear of assassination.</span></p> <p><span>Jebsen claims that an American military presence is needed to provide stability in Central America.  But what kind of stability is this?  As Jebsen says, right-wine death squads are murdering hundreds of innocent civilians each month.  He goes on to point out that the leftist gugerillas control one-fourth of El Salvador and are growing stronger.  According to Jebsen, these are reasons to leave American troops in El Salvador.  He says that without American support the government that is providing all this stability would collapse.  He suggests that this would result in \"Marxist domination\" of El Salvador.  In the first place, this is an example of falling prey to the standard right wing flaw of seeing all Socialist groups as monolithic supporters of the Kremlin.  Governments usually do not turn to the Soviets out of choice, but out of necessity.  While America provided some support to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, its indifference (and now active opposition) has pushed Nicaragua toward the Soviet camp.</span></p> <p><span>Even if Jebsen's scenario is correct, and U.S. military withdrawal does lead to an El Salvador controlled by a Soviet-backed regime, the question is how bad would that be?  Jebsen suggests that El Salvador is different from Vietnam because it is closer to home.  But Cuba is only 90 miles from the American shore, and although it has been a Communist state for twenty-five years.  American children still aren't taught in Russian.  Jebsen says El Salvador is of strategic importance, but this simply isn't the case.  El Salvador itself is of no military importance; it is only important because of its proximity to the Panama Canal.  Thus Jebsen argues the domino theory.  But El Salvador only borders Guatemala and Honduras, two countries that already have unstable dictatorships.</span></p> <p><span>Jebsen seems to argue that since insurgents on the left and right have guns, we should provide weapons to the \"legitimate\" government.  This sounds dangerously like the arguments of those who oppose gun control.  They claim that criminals will always get weapons, and therefore, gun control will only keep guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens.  Unfortunately the facts don't support his theory.  Just as the guns that are owned by our upright citizens are often used against them, the rebels in El Salvador capture much of their artillery from supplies that the U.S. sends to the Salvadoran government.</span></p> <p><span>A further point that Jebsen obscures is that most of us who argue against an American military presence in Central America and against giving military aid to countries in that region, would not have the U.S. abandon that region entirely.  The U.S. would still provide economic aid and use its influence through diplomatic channels.</span></p> <p><span>The real danger in American foreign policy has never been an unwillingness to use force, but rather a feeling that all problems have military solutions.  Jebsen tries to cloud his arguments in a tone of reasonableness, but we should be wary of a man who faults someone for opposing the deployment of American troops in Lebanon.  Jebsen suggests that El Salvador is different from Vietnam because it has only 5 million people, not 40 million, implying that we could \"win\" in El Salvador.  This kind of thinking led the Reagan administration to invade the tiny island of Grenada.  It is unfortunate that public opinion polls about the Grenada invasion indicate that America loves a war that it can win.</span></p> <p><span>Ever since the days of Theodore Roosevelt our response to any unrest in Central America and the Caribbean has been to \"send in the marines\".  Isn't about time to reassess this policy?  There is only one true democracy in Central America--Costa Rica.  Costa Rica is also the only nation in the region without a standing army.  There is a lesson to be learned here.  The way to achieve democracy is not through military might, but by improving economic conditions to create a climate for peaceful political reform. <b>Andrew L.

In Nagasaki, three days later, another bomb is dropped, killing nearly seventy thousand people Shortly afterwards.  American military and political leaders begin planning Operation Crossroads, designed to demonstrate the effects of atomic explosions on naval vessels.</span></p> <p><span>Two atomic blasts known as Able and Baker, one an air drop and the other underwater, signalled the beginning of Crossroads.  The experiment occurred in the Bikini Atoll, then under American control and identified by the U.S. Navy as a prime testing site because of its distance from the U.S. and small population.</span></p> <p><span>A year later, a group of islands previously under a League of Nations mandate to the Japanese-the Marshall Islands along with the Caroline and Mariana Islands [previously under a League of Nations Mandate to the Japanese] became a United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific, administered by the U.S.  Two obligations of the Charter required that the U.S.:</span></p> <p><span>* promote the economic advancement and self-sufficiency of the inhabitants, and to this end shall regulate the use of the natural resources; encourage the development of fisheries, agriculture, and industries; protect the inhabitants against the loss of their lands and resources; and improve the means of transportation and communication.</span></p> <p><span>* promote the social advancement of the inhabitants, and to this end shall protect the rights and fundamental freedoms of all elements of the population without discrimination; protect the health of the inhabitants.\"</span></p> <p><span>Instead, the U.S. government and military have used the islands--which make up an area known as Micronesia that is nearly as large as the U.S. itself--as a test site for advanced nuclear weaponry, frequently relocating island inhabitants to do so.  The Marshall Islanders have become guinea pigs for the detonation of at least 66 atomic and hydrogen bombs in the 1940s and '50s.</span></p> <p><span>While much debate about U.S. military safety in nuclear testing has occurred since the publication of the Warren papers, top secret documents detailing government incompetence in insuring the safety of its officers, the inhabitants of Micronesia have been noticeably ignored.</span></p> <p><span>This oversight is all the more inexcusable because the effects of nuclear weapons testing are still being felt by residents of Micronesia.  Children carried to full term by Micronesians often go through life plagued with cancerous growths and serious thyroid problems.  A common phenomenon on many of the islands is the birth of unhealthy children known as \"jellyfish babies,\" which appear as blobs of flesh whose only indication of life is a spasmodic hopping motion that accompanies breathing.</span></p> <p><span>Despite noted increases in body radiation content among the Micronese from nuclear testing, the United States government continues testing nuclear weaponry and delivery systems in the area.  Virtually all of the U.S. inter-continental ballistic missiles, including the Polaris, Minutemen and Trident, have been tested at the Kwajalein Missiles Range in Micronesia.</span></p> <p><span>Most disturbing, such experimentation seems to be an attempt to use the Micronese as subjects to find out the effects of nuclear exposure to humans.  As one government report noted in 1957 following the Bravo test of the 15 megaton hydrogen bomb:</span></p> <p><span>\"In spite of slight lingering radio-activity\" the Atoll Rongelap is safe for habitation.  The exposed people from 1954 returned home with more than 200 Rongelap who were taken away from the atoll during the Bravo test.  Brook haven National Laboratory doctors called this exposed group \"an ideal comparison population for the studies.\"</span></p> <p><span>Residents of the affected islands in Micronesia have called for compensation for the damages caused for testing and have asked President Reagan to declare a moratorium on testing missiles at Kwajalein Atoll.  To date, nothing has come of the discussions.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE IRONY is that the U.S. was given a trust to improve and care for the islands by the United Nations.  But because this region also has strategic priority for the U.S., it is denied the protection usually granted a \"protectorate.\"  The U.S. government serves as a benevolent dictator, willing to give aid and food supplies to the Micronesians in exchange for the opportunity to test nuclear weapons on their homelands.</span></p> <p><span>Most recently, the U.S. Pentagon had expressed an interest in using Micronesia for a jungle warfare training bases.  Already a site for nuclear waste dumping by the U.S. and other world powers, the islanders have appealed to the United Nations for a voice in their own destiny.</span></p> <p><span>Although the U.S. government ostensibly represents their views, the Micronesians have no representatives in Congress.  In March of 1979, the Marshall use established a constitutional government which was approved by popular referendum.  A year later the U.S. and Marshall Islands agreed to a pact of free association, giving the Marshall Islands control over their internal and foreign affairs, so long as it does not conflict with U.S. authority for security and defense.  Such an agreement is the equivalent of telling an elephant it has the right to fly, knowing that it possess no such capability.  As one Micronesia representative remarked:</span></p> <p><span>We have only been promised and provided that we give America our lands for military purposes as listed in the so-called.  Free Association Compact.  We have been promised and only if we forbid other nations from doing what the United States wants to do with our islands--that is dominate us militarily...\"</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE UNITED STATES government, in the instance of Micronesia has perverted the meaning of the word trust, leaving unfulfilled most of the tenets of the U. N. Charter.  The quality of life, the excessive exposure to radiation, the threat to future generations of Micronese demands the attention of the international community.  The horrors of nuclear fallout should not have to be suffered.</span></p> <p><span>A Nuclear-Free Pacific movement has begun to challenge the escalating military presence in the region.  The New England Pacific Coalition, a local network of peace and nuclear disarmament organizations, has kept close attention on the developments in Micronesia.  Given the atrocities imposed upon Micronesia for the benefits of U.S. security, the need for greater American concern for the issue cannot be overstated.</span></p> <p><span><i>(This is a first article in a two-part series.

{"title": "Returning to the Schools | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Christopher A. Bogden is a PhD candidate at Harvard's Graduate School of Education.  Like most students at the school--where the average student age is 31-Bogden came from the work world, after directing a school for functionally illiterate drop-outs in Baltimore, Md.</span></p> <p><span>Bogden says he came to the Ed School in 1981 as a respite from the pressures of his job, and to explore the more theoretical aspects of education.  \"I wanted to acquaint myself with some more cerebral ideas, to get an exposure to the broad spectrum of issues that the Ed School focused on, like labor relations, computers in education, historical perspectives on education and politics and education.\"</span></p> <p><span>But in three years since Bogden left the real world of school teaching, the Ed School has moved in exactly the opposite direction from Bogden--closer to schools, in order to relate its scholarly expertise more directly to the pragmatic issues of teaching.</span></p> <p><span>Criticized by some over the last decade for being divorced from the realities of running schools, the Ed School is now embarking on several new projects.  These include the development of a center to train scientists in industry as school-teachers, a program where principals learn how to manage their institutions better and a host of other efforts aimed at improving school leadership.</span></p> <p><span>\"I see some very healthy signs that concern for schools and school improvement is becoming part of the fabric around here,\" says Senior Lecturer Roland S. Barth.  Barth directed a 1979 study of the Ed School which criticized the school for cutting its teacher certification program in 1973 as well as its programs for certifying principals and superintendents.</span></p> <p><span>But the school's long-standing image as primarily a scholarly research institution--concerned with everything from the psychological and political perspectives on education--has begun to change with the introduction of the nuts-and-bolts programs.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's no question about the fact that we want to pay more attention to teaching people how to teach,\" says Ed School Dean Patricia A. Graham.</span></p> <p><span><b>Retraining Scientists as Teachers</b></span></p> <p><span>In its first year, the Ed School's fledgling Mid-Career Math-Science Program has attracted five students and much national attention.  One student is a retired Army colonel with an advanced nuclear engineering degree who made $50,000 a year in business.  Another is a woman who came from the booming high-tech industry of optical photography.  Two others were engineers in industrial research.</span></p> <p><span>After one year of course work and internships in local schools, the students will earn masters' degrees certifying them s high school math and science teachers.  Next year they will be in teaching positions paying them no more than $18,000.</span></p> <p><span>\"The idea behind the program is to take people who are already good at math or science and help them become teachers,\" says the program's director, Katherine M. Merseth.</span></p> <p><span>A 1983 Department of Education report charged that the United States suffers a \"severe shortage of qualified mathematics, science and technology teachers.\"</span></p> <p><span>But \"Harvard is not going to solve the shortage of qualified teachers.  The program is kept small for a purpose.  People in the middle of a career change need quality instruction and individual counselling,\" Merseth adds.</span></p> <p><span>The program will triple in size next year, and more than 25 other universities have expressed interest in starting up similar programs.  According to Merseth, George Washington University, Rutgers, and the University of California at Berkeley have all limited planning for mid-career masters programs.</span></p> <p><span>\"If other institutions start doing this--turning out very small, high-quality classes of certified teachers--it could make a big difference,\" Merseth says.  \"The goal of the program is to establish a model for other institutions to copy.\"</span></p> <p><span>Anthony L. Copas worked as a senior research engineer in a Boston chemical plant, making more than $30,000 a year, but he decided to join the Ed School program because \"I spent seven years in industry and found myself moving farther and farther from science.  I wanted to get back to it, and do something meaningful with my life,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Tuition at the Ed School now runs $8320 a year for masters students and Copas says that forfeiting his salary and playing tuition \"have been a shock to my financial structure.  I have loans to pay as a result.\"</span></p> <p><span>But in his decision to change careers, Copas says money \"wasn't the all-powerful, all-driving force.  I think I can be a good teacher, and the nation needs good math and science teachers.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>A Place for Principals</b></span></p> <p><span>\"For a guy who's been in education for 30 years, I was starting to run out of gas.  The Principals' Center was the juice I needed,\" says John E. Oser, principal of a Falmouth, Mass.  elementary school.</span></p> <p><span>More than 550 principals from across the country have joined the center at the $120 membership price, and anywhere from 10 to 100 participate in the center's weekly events, which include workshops, discussions and lectures geared toward improving school supervision.</span></p> <p><span>\"We hope to further the profession growth of the practicing principal, because principals who are learning and growing will be more effective school leaders,\" says Kenneth S. Haskins, one of the center's co-directors.</span></p> <p><span>Oser, who made the two-and-a-half-hour drive from Falmouth every week last year to attend the center's events, calls the center an \"educational marketplace.  When I come back to Falmouth I try to generate the same kind of excitement about the ideas to the other administrators and principals in my district.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Principals' Center came about as a key recommendation of Barth's report, but members emphasize that although the Ed School founded and houses the program, it is run for the most part by the principals themselves.</span></p> <p><span>\"Harvard set up the opportunity for us to get together,\" says Alvin V. Fortune, principal of Brookline's Pierce School.  \"Initially we might have been apprehensive about Harvard's role in the program, but we aren't anymore\"</span></p> <p><span><b>School Leadership</b></span></p> <p><span>In addition to these two ventures, the Ed School has initiated a variety of smaller programs, including:</span></p> <p><span>* A Master's concentration in Schooling and School Leadership.  The one-year program--which does not lead to teacher certification--is designed for students interested in school administration and more effective teaching methods.  The Ed School added a cluster of new courses this fall for the new degree.</span></p> <p><span>* Summer workshops for writing and social studies instructors to improve their teaching skills.</span></p> <p><span>* A program known as the Ed-Tech Center, funded by a $7.7 million Department of Education grant.  The center studies how computers and other technology can be used to improve teaching of math and science.</span></p> <p><span>* A Committee on Schooling, which since its founding last summer has sponsored a forum on the recent flood of literature calling for school improvements, and which plans a similar colloquium next year on large-scale innovations in public education.</span></p> <p><span>* Possibly reinstating some sort of teacher and principal certification programs for students at the Ed School.</span></p> <p><span>* Possibly creating a program for Harvard undergraduates to earn teacher certification while pursuing their undergraduate degrees.  \"We're discussing this plan with (Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education) Sidney Verba ('53) and other members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences,\" says Ursula E. Wagener, Ed School assistant dean for academic and student services.  \"It's only in the idea stage now, but we're committed to the concept behind it--to get bright people into teaching.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>A Background of Change</b></span></p> <p><span>Five years ago, the Barth report found that in the '50s, the Ed School succeeded in the dual mission of \"training teachers, guidance counselors, principals and superintendents and, at the same time, in promoting distinguished research.\"</span></p> <p><span>But while theoretical research in education was blossoming in the '60s, the report criticized the Ed School for \"shifting dramatically\" away from being directly concerned with schooling.</span></p> <p><span>Barth says he attributed the decline during the '70s in concern with schooling to \"pessimism about how much schools could accomplish.  Studies were coming out that emphasized other factors as being crucial to a child's intellectual growth--particularly his background--race, class, homelife, and parents.\"</span></p> <p><span>In 1979, the Ed School faculty voted to accept the Barth report's recommendation that the school get back to close involvement with \"educational practice and practitioners.\"</span></p> <p><span>Other factors also contributed to the faculty turnaround.  When Graham became the school's new dean in 1982, she said, \"We must increase our efforts to understand and to improve those institutions whose primary activity ought to be education--namely, the schools.\"</span></p> <p><span>President Bok echoed those sentiments in his 1983 Commencement address, when he called on the Ed School to increase its role in the \"growing national concern for higher standards of education.\"  Bok spoke on the heels of a widely publicized report by the National Commission on Excellence in Education--appointed by President Reagan--which roundly assailed public education in the United States and called for a smorgasbord of reforms.</span></p> <p><span>However, Graham says the increased national concern over education fostered--but did not cause--the Ed School's new sense of mission.  \"Our renewed commitment to schooling preceded the appointment of the commission and the papers and reports.  It began even before the Department of Education was created\" in 1979.</span></p> <p><span>But for Ed School students solely interested in teaching, the school, which produces far more administrators than teachers, may still not be the ideal place to study.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think this new emphasis has been more toward administration than classroom teaching,\" says Rebecca Beardshaw, a masters student who wants to be an elementary school teacher.</span></p> <p><span>Lawrence F. Dieringer, a masters student who plans a career in teaching, says there is still \"little emphasis on teaching, learning, and curriculum.\"  He hopes the school will \"make a greater effort in the direction of pedagoguery.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I think it is very difficult to change any organization overnight, even it school of Ed.,\" says Laura A. Cooper, a third-year doctoral student who plans to enter the public schools as an administrator.  \"But it's important to recognize that the programs and activities that have been put into effect are very important first steps toward bringing the Ed School closer to the real world.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>\"We must increase our efforts to understand and to improve those Institutions whose primary activity ought to be education--namely, the schools...There's no question about the fact that we want to pay more attention to teaching.\"</b></span></p> <p><span><b>--Ed School Dean Patricia A.

{"title": "Mining the Store | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE REAGAN Administration is like the school yard bully who thinks the rules apply to everyone but himself.  Late last week the Marxist Sandinista government of Nicaragua announced plans to file suit in the International Court of Justice charging the United States \"with training, supplying and directing military and paramilitary actions against the people and government of Nicaragua, resulting in extensive loss of lives and property.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Sandinistas' case is compelling, if not moot, since the press has reported on American involvement in this \"secret war\" for more than a year, and Congress has been openly debating the extent of \"covert\" aid for some time.  The latest alleged \"action\" against our Central American adversaries is CIA control of mining operations in Nicaraguan harbors, an act of terrorism that quite likely constitutes an act of war.</span></p> <p><span>So what does the bully, backed into a corner, decide to do?  He picks up his ball and bat and he walks away.  Yesterday, the state department announced the United States would not accept International Court rulings on Central America for two years, essentially conceding the U.S. has not a chance against international opinion--critics of the harbor mining include Britain and France.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, the World Court, the judicial branch of the United Nations, has no real power.  No enforcement branch follows up its rulings.  No country is bound to abide by its pronouncements.  Like the rest of the United Nations, the World Court is a good idea that has run up against an insurmountable obstacle:  a nationalistic parochialism that makes true global community impossible.</span></p> <p><span>So why is the bully running from the wimp?</span></p> <p><span>We liberals, who claim to support the underdogs, the oppressed, the wimps of the world, like to argue that the bully is running because in the final analysis he has no moral defense.  The United States' actions in Nicaragua are immoral, as well as wrongheaded and antithetical to our interests in the region, and the World Court affair shows us President Reagan's brazen disregard for democratic ideals.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond the fact that this move is a several of 40 years of American adherence to the World Court; beyond the fact that the Reagan administration is symbolically choosing military might over judicial settlement--we are learning that Reagan lives in a skewed amoral world.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE ADMINISTRATION defense rocks of double-talk.  First, according to State Department spokesman John Hughes, an international legal battle would draw energy away from the \"regional negotiations\" which are \"the best way to resolve the conflicts in Central America.\" That makes some sense, but Hughes neglected to mention that the Administration has turned a deaf ear to the Contadora group, which has been pushing for negotiations all along.  Nor did Hughes address the discrepancy between the alleged heartfelt desire for negotiation and the real Administration emphasis of late:  squeezing a bloated military assistance budget out of Congress and clandestinely mining Nicaraguan harbors without informing key members of Congress.</span></p> <p><span>Second, and more significant, Hughes announced that the administration wants to head off a Nicaraguan attempt to use the World Court as a forum for \"anti-American propaganda.\" Hughes didn't mention what that propaganda might be, but you can assume it would include the charge that we are trying to subvert their government and mine their harbors.  This second argument exposes the cynical, anti-democratic side of the administration.  No argument was made defending the administration position on legal or moral grounds.  And President Reagan's silence on the issue has sent this message:  I am the bully, thus I am right.  I don't have to justify myself.</span></p> <p><span>Democracy used to work something like this:  one person stated a position, another person stated a position, they argued in public, everybody voted.  President Reagan doesn't work that way.  The President essentially said to Congress.  \"Even if you disagree with one it's your duty to vote with me on foreign policy.\" Afterwards National Security Advisor Robert McFarlane  suggested that members of Congress should relieve their tingling of dissent by writing letters to the President, not voting against him.  Democracy is just too money for these people.</span></p> <p><span>Some of the most trenchant criticism levelled at President Reagan appeared in a New York Times book review two months ago.  Assessing a collection of modern humor Roy Blount's review strayed into musings on the political circus:</span></p> <p><span>President Johnson, Nixon and Carter were reflective enough to be anxious about how they were going over with thinking persons; and therefore thinking persons earnestly scorned them.  President Reagan is different.</span></p> <p><span>In 1982 a member of the Administration did declare that 'we are being savaged on the fairness issue' and that the President should mount a campaign to convince the public of how unjust it was to call his government unfair.  But this President is too smart and not profound enough for that.  He never appears to feel savaged.  When he seems to savage himself, it is by saying something to blithely beside the point that thinking persons are nonplussed.</span></p> <p><span>We liberals are so befuddled by President Reagan because our dislike for him doesn't bother him a bit.  But that's not what's dangerous about the events of the last week.  What's dangerous is Reagan's lack of any foreign policy standards.  One former CIA official complained to me last year.  \"The real decisions are made in the basement of the White House by people who are not confirmed and do not testify.  These folks use the CIA as their representatives and executors abroad.  Congress has little control over it.  I wish foreign policy could move back to the State Department, but it's a dream, only a dream.\"</span></p> <p><span>Democrats, take note in this election year--you are facing a bully who doesn't want to come out of the basement and play democracy.</span></p>"}

Or is it that we can think what we like, so long as we don't write it'</span></p> <p><span>2) The comments by Pi Eta members watching the protest were crude.  They were not without a point, however, i.e., is it not concern able that organizations such as GLSA are equally morally reprehensible to some students' (No!  No!  Never at such a broad-minded University!) Or is it the case that morality is judged by popular ballot--more people despise Pi Eta's sexual ethic (as allegedly represented in its newsletter) than despise other groups' sexual choices?  If this is the case then prepare for the worst--and don't scream when some majority legislates your morality</span></p> <p><span>3) Pi Eta members have essentially, in the minds of many, been convicted of rape for what they've said This, though no reports of sexual abuse have issued from women attending the club's functions, this though women seem to have entered the club's party even during the protest Saturday night.  I guess we are left to conclude that these women were incapable of caring for themselves.  Big Sister to the rescue again</span></p> <p><span>4) It thought crime is to be a legitimate charge (and so far, nothing else has been charged) then, for God's sake.  let's lock up everyone who ever advocated the violent overthrow of the United States government-- and everyone out there who ever mumbled about wishing Reagan had been killed had better turn yourselves in to the Though Police This goes as well for women who advocate burning down the Pi Eta building</span></p> <p><span>5) Bad taste and stupidity are not crimes and these are the only real complaints against Pi Eta--other than that the letter was \"inflammatory\" and \"incited men to commit rape.\" I haven't yet found anyone who committed or considered committing rape after reading the newsletter, and everyone is either squeaking and beeping with outrage or laughing at those who take it seriously.  I do find offensive the charge that men become rapists after reading such drivel--that we cannot think without our testicles getting in the way.

First, foreign policy should not be \"run\"; rather, it must be formulated with consideration to various perspectives, national and global, and to long term implications.

{"title": "Playing Games | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>C</b>ONGRESSIONAL, statute requires the CIA \"to keep the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives fully and currently informed of all intelligence activities...\"  But CIA chief William Casey and ranking Senator on the Intelligence Committee Barry Goldwater (D-Ariz) seem recently to have taken this to mean a game of twenty questions, in which the listener.  If he prefers not to know the answer, doesn't ask the right questions.</span></p> <p><span>The CIA was required to keep both the Senate and the House committees informed of its Nicaraguan activities, which are now well-known to the public.  These operations began as far back as Sept. 8 of last year with the CIA-backed bombing of Corinto, and continued until early this year with the CIA-run mining of major Nicaraguan ports.  Although both the Senate and the House committees were not directly informed of activities by the CIA at any time, the House Committee began \"asking the right questions\" sometimes in early January, while the Senate delayed their enquiry until March 8 for reason that remain a mystery.  CIA requests for money in early January should have signalled the committee of the need for a meeting, but ranking majority member Senator Goldwater agreed to postpone the meeting first until late February and then until March 8, when the issue of the minings was somehow passed over.  When Goldwater recently discovered what it seems the House knew ever since January that CIA agents were mining the harbors, not American-backed Contras--he wrote a letter to CIA chief William Casey saying that he, Goldwater, was \"pissed off\" that he hadn't been informed.</span></p> <p><span>Now, there's certainly more that's strange here than meets the eye.  First of all, Goldwater:  why did he allow the CIA to postpone meetings on two different occasions and then not focus debate in the March 8 meeting on the mining issue, which must have been in his newspaper by then?  Why, further, has Senator Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) resigned in protest at <i>not having been told</i> about the mining?  Such a resignation hardly seems an apt way to protest failure on the part of a <i>subsidiary</i> body to conform to rules set for it.  But strangest of all, don't the House and Senate intelligence committees share information?  It seems patently ludicrous that Senator Goldwater should not have known something about the mining if the House knew about it already.  And above it all the horrible sphinx, William J. Casey, sits grinning:  \"I don't have to answer questions I'm not asked.\"</span></p> <p><span>Clearly there's something strange about Goldwater's conduct, just as there is something strange about the CIA, whose actions throughout the year seem to have been in direct contradiction of the laws that supposedly bind it.  The CIA is carrying on what amounts to a war with Nicaragua, without regulation, without government input other than the interests of the executive, and with what seems to be a tacit understanding between the bureau head and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.</span></p> <p><span>Conspiracy theories are a thing of the past--the new game governments play is incompetence--and the Senate Committee chairman probably didn't know about the CIA's activities.  The CIA also probably assumed that they must not have been interested in hearing what they had not asked for.  But whatever the case, it is awfully disconcerting to discover that such inept monitors stand between the CIA and Nicaragua.  The president says we are fighting a war to protect democracy, but even our own checks and balances are being flaunted by the executive and scattered by the Congress.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the most important message to take away from this whole mess is a sense of warning.  In Nicaragua, it is reported, citizens wait on our election year with baited breath.  Professors who spend Sundays at war and the rest of the week with their work preface their books with notes about who will win, while television stars plan their careers around whether or not their show's political content will survive a Reagan election.  In the tiny town of San Juan Del Norte, one of the few the Reagan CIA contras hold, a guard now stops journalists from entering.  AP reported last week that the guard, who is a member of the \"Democratic Revolutionary Alliance,\" said he had orders from his commander not to allow any journalists to pass through to the Nicaraguan port, because it is being bombed by the Sandinista's air force and he could not guarantee their safety.  That is a tale we've heard before, not so long ago.</span></p>"}

That April, the Administration issued an executive order which allowed the government to clamp down on any information that \"by itself or in the context of other information could be expected to cause damage to the national security.\"</span></p> <p><span>Critics immediately noted that the order's vagueness gave the government virtually a free hand in restricting information and argued that it reversed 30 years of policy aimed at casing such limitations.</span></p> <p><span>On the legislative side, several bills have been introduced which would increase the authority of the Defense Department to limit what sort of information gets sent abroad.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, the government has been more zealously limiting travel by foreign scholars, mostly from the Soviet Union and China, and the Commerce Department recently initiated \"Operation Exodus,\" which is aimed at checking the export of high technology information.</span></p> <p><span>In an attempt to alleviate the growing tensions the Defense.

The department's review would be purely advisory, and the researcher would make the final decision whether to publish.</span></p> <p><span>*The third area has caused the greatest controversy.  The Department wants to see all results from research in sensitive areas of exploratory development before submission for publication, and it wants the right to change or withhold publication.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard scientists are concerned primarily about being forced to yield the decision on whether to publish to the Pentagon and about the vagueness of what the government means by \"sensitive,\" says Dean of the Division of Applied Sciences Paul C.

{"title": "China and No First Use | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>How many people realize that China, which started the world on the path to the nuclear arms race by inventing gunpowder, has also come up with a possible antidote--the doctrine of \"no first use\"?  As President Reagan commences his state visit to the People's Republic of China (PRC), it can be instructive to look at how China has viewed the bomb and reacted to the growing strength of the two nuclear superpowers and, in particular, the Soviet military buildup along its borders.</span></p> <p><span>Although Mao Zedong (Mao Tsetung) publicly disdained atomic weapons as paper tigers.  China was determined to develop a nuclear capability whatever the cost and sacrifice--if necessary, \"going without trousers,\" in the words of a former foreign minister.</span></p> <p><span>To its everlasting regret, the USSR initially provided assistance to its fledgling ally in this endeavor.  However, Khrushchev reneged on a promise to provide China a \"sample\" A-bomb, according to Beijing which made this charge when presenting its account of the Sino-Soviet schism.  Nevertheless, in April 1964, within 15 years of its establishment, the PRC successfully detonated an atomic device.</span></p> <p><span>Beijing was more conscious of the political fall-out than the radioactive one--a situation which to a considerable degree pertains today.  In announcing the test, the PRC proclaimed that it was developing atomic weapons for defensive purposes only and that it would never be the first to use such weapons nor would it ever use, or even threaten to use, them against nations which did not possess them.</span></p> <p><span>In the two decades since, China has persistently reiterated this theme, which forms the centerpiece of its sweeping arms control proposals and peace plans.  With equal persistence, it has quietly pursued the development of nuclear weapons, despite the political turmoil of the Cultural revolution, under Mao and under his successors.</span></p> <p><span>China has not played a constructive role in arms control.  It has opposed agreements on test bans and non-proliferation, has placed strict conditions on its participation in arms control parleys and agreements, and has sought to avoid any controls on its own nuclear weapons program or its transactions with other countries involving nuclear technology or materials.</span></p> <p><span>Beijing has shaped its nuclear weapons program and its broader deterrence strategy in the context of the \"strategic triangle\" of the USSR, US, and PRC.  Although publicly Beijing has decried the hegemonistic behavior and unbridled arms race of the two nuclear superpowers and has emphasized its independent foreign policy stance, strategically and tactically, of course, it tilts toward the US.</span></p> <p><span>But the Soviet Union is unquestionably regarded as the principal external threat to Chinese security.  The Sino-Soviet border clashes of 1969 and an abortive Soviet plan to take out China's nuclear facilities in a swift preemptive strike undoubtedly contributed to China's interest in repairing relations with the US and creating Sino-US ties that would give the Soviets pause in contemplating any military action against the PRC.</span></p> <p><span>China has developed a comprehensive policy framework for its strategic weapons program, one that includes a broad-gauged, nuanced deterrence strategy and a declaratory policy on nuclear weapons use, both of which conform to China's perceived national interests, circumstances and resources.</span></p> <p><span>Part of this deterrence strategy is periodically to demonstrate the Washington-Beijing entente by high-level visits between the two countries.  The reported existence of a joint intelligence facility in Northwest China to monitor.  Soviet advanced weapons tests also sends a message to Moscow.</span></p> <p><span>Equally a part of this strategy has been a cooling of tensions between the PRC and USSR over the past three years.  Beijing has lowered its rhetoric if not its guard.  It has engaged in a series of vice-ministerial talks with Moscow that have led to increases in trade and some improvements in government-to-government relations and contacts.</span></p> <p><span>The bottom line for top Chinese leaders has been to enhance China's security and well-being at minimum risk and cost.  For them, the modernization of a Socialist China is the top priority.  This places constraints on the resources available for strategic weapons and other military requirements.  Under a strict austerity program adopted five years ago, China reduced its military spending in 1980 and again in 1981.  More recently, in order \"to cope with international developments\" (in the words of Premier Zhao in June 1983).  Beijing has indicated that defense modernization would be given higher priority with special attention paid to strategic weapons programs.  However, it has declined to give budget data and has implied that increased spending on modern and advanced weapons will be made possible by economizing elsewhere within the military establishment.</span></p> <p><span>Which brings us back, circuitously, to China's declaratory policy on nuclear weapons and its invention of the \"no first use\" and \"non use\" doctrine.  This has cost China nothing and has not hampered its strategic weapons programs.  Conversely, it has made propaganda points for China throughout the world, improved its international image, and established an approach, which, if accepted by the other nuclear powers, could enhance China's security and ultimately reduce the enormous cost for China of membership in the exclusive nuclear club.</span></p> <p><span>There has been widespread endorsement of \"no-first-use\", \"non-use\" and the analogous concept of nuclear free zones, most particularly by the non-nuclear nations.  India's Indira Gandhi and Canada's Pierre Trudcau have made impassioned pleas for declarations of restraint by the nuclear powers.  Pope John Paul II has echoed these sentiments.</span></p> <p><span>Without giving China any credit, the Soviet Union in 1982 in a pronouncement by Leonid Brezhney formally adopted a \"no first use\" policy.  As recently as March 1984 Moscow has reiterated this pledge and hinted broadly that a similar declaration by the US would bring it back to the negotiating table.  To date, both the US and us fellow Western nuclear powers, the UK and France have declined to endorse the concept even in principle or as a declared objective.</span></p> <p><span>Needless to say it would give China great \"face\" were its doctrine accepted by all five nuclear powers.  Such a development would also offer the best prospect for getting China to abandon its present standoffish attitude towards negotiations among the nuclear powers.</span></p> <p><span>Although there are problems with US adoption of \"no first use\"--our commitment to NATO for example--the principle, which has been advocated by a series of distinguished Americans, is deserving of greater attention by Washington.  As a first step, it would make eminent sense for the US to confer with the PRC on ways in which its \"no first use\" concept to the security of ourselves or other nations.</span></p> <p><span><i>Richard D.

{"title": "Misplaced Horror | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N THE PAST few years, Harvard and Cambridge have moved to the forefront of the national debate over world armaments and arms control.  The publication of <i>Living with Nuclear Weapons</i> at the behest of President Bok and the city-wide referendum last fall on a nuclear weapons testing and production ban are but two of the more prominent and commendable manifestations of this trend.  The debate has its darker side, however, and nothing illustrate this better than recent local controversy over a global problem--chemical and biological warfare.</span></p> <p><span>Few actions arouse more spontaneous revulsion than the deliberate use of toxic substances and pathogens against other humans.  The thousands of mustard gassed blind and lung burned soldiers returning from World War I (and those that did not return) sparked an immediate world outcry.  The result was the 1925 Geneva Protocol outlawing both biological and chemical weapons.  The United States did not sign, perhaps as a by-product of the same isolationism that prompted the Senate not to ratify' entry into the League of Nations, but all other major powers were signatories to the treaty World War II saw no large scale use of these types of weapons except in the horrors of the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately it seems that revulsion against the microscopic death carriers has not been shared equally among all nations in the last two decades.  American use of chemicals like napalm and Agent Orange, while not strictly chemical or biological warfare, must bear part of the blame for touching off a renewed use of chemicals in war.  Despite the post Vietnam move toward d\u00e9tente that included a U.S. pushed 1974 Biological Weapons Convention outlawing bacteriological means of war which was signed by 111 nations chemical weaponry appears to be on the rise.  Use of the outlawed substances has recently been proven in more instances than at any time since WWI--\"yellow rain\" in Laos, Cambodia, and Afghanistan as a result of Soviet-backed or direct Soviet aggression, and by Iraq against Iran.  Reports have ranged from \"ordinary\" use of mustard gas by Iraq to the widespread, unexplained presence of artificial disease-causing toxins in Southeast Asia.</span></p> <p><span>Yet world outcry against these horrible revelations has taken some strange forms.  Initial press reaction to the Reagan Administrations condemnation of Soviet \"yellow rain\" was skeptical at best scoffing at worst.  The U.N. has refused to openly condemn the Soviet Union and its allies for their glaring infractions against the biological weapons treaties.  And here at home, a Harvard professor earlier this month dismissed \"yellow rain\" as nothing more than bee feces, while the Cambridge Department of Public Health has tried to stop a local company from manufacturing nerve gas for the Pentagon.</span></p> <p><span>Professor Matthew S. Meselson's attack on the Administration's position implicitly denies the validity of the government's evidence.  Meselson contends that the toxins claimed by the Administration to be biological weapons are in fact naturally occurring microbes.  Further, he claims that the \"yellow rain\" may actually be merely the product of mass bee defecation flights and says he was caught in just such a shower while visiting Thailand last month.  Yet, while bee feces may create some toxins.  Meselson's theory simply does not account for the indication of massive toxins in Southeast Asia.</span></p> <p><span>Also this month the Cambridge health authorities have tried to bar the Arthur D. Little Co. from manufacturing binary nerve gas shells in a North Cambridge laboratory.  The weapons, budgeted two years ago in heated Congressional debate, contain two non-toxic substances which combine to make nerve gas only after the weapon has been fired.  Before producing any evidence that a health hazard was posed by local manufacture, the department sought a ban, which was promptly overturned by a local court.  The city has now actually sought an extension of the ruling in order to try and build a case.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>T IS certainly unfortunate that the U.S. finds itself making these hated devices in violation of both the Geneva Protocol and Biological Weapons Convention.  But it is the only hope of deterring further chemical attacks by the Soviet Union.  Chemical and biological weapons are qualitatively different from other types of weaponry.  A sudden, widespread breakout of mysterious disease--experienced by 50,000 Locations in the period 1976-80 and thousands of Afghan tribesmen since 1980--would not prompt an immediate conventional or nuclear counterattack.  Instead, delays would result from time consuming investigation doubt even sickness among the commanders.  Faced with such scenarios, and with hard evidence denied by no one (including the Russians) that the Soviet chemical and biological weapons industry employs over 1,00,000 people and busies 14 industrial complexes, the Reagan Administration two years ago took the uncomfortable but correct first step toward deterrence of this type of aggression with a $123 million nerve gas program.</span></p> <p><span>The other half of an effective deferent in any weapons category should be the active search for a verifiable limitation treaty, and this avenue took a hopeful turn last week when Vice President Bush brought a draft chemical weapons treaty to the Geneva talks on general disarmament issues.  The Soviet have already rejected it, primarily because of its strong verification measures.  Just as in other talks, the Russians have shown themselves to be inflexible over anything which threatens their closed society.  This obstacle is significant since even more than in other weapon categories, a chemical weapons treaty would need constant, vigilant verification--any university, lab, or factory could be a potential site for manufacture.</span></p> <p><span>In the end we are left with a now familiar classical dilemma of our age--our government finds itself making devices which nobody wants, everyone fears, and are never intended for use.  But we are also left with a type of weapon which, sadly, cannot really escape the cruel dictates of deterrence theory.  Despite their admitted horror, weapons which burn lungs, spread plague or shatter central nervous systems still respond to the same \"logic\" as nukes--if the United States has them the Soviets will be less tempted to use them.</span></p> <p><span>Arguments over \"how much\" or \"when to use\" should be welcomed in places like Harvard and Cambridge.  Such public forums as the referendum last fall and the Nuclear Study Group's book served a good purpose.  Concepts like \"no first use\" or \"no export\" for chemical and biological warfare can be debated in forums or specially commissioned studies.  But emotional revulsions by city health departments and head-in-the-sand disclaimers from professors serve no one--especially not the Laotians and Afghans dying from Soviet-manufactured \"yellow rain.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Gagging the Latest Gag Rule | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>M</b>EMBERS OF THE HARVARD COMMUNITY got a first-hand glimpse of the Reagan Administration's rage for secrecy last week when University officials made clear their opposition to the Pentagon's latest gag rule.  Daniel Steiner '54, vice president and general counsel, led a chorus of denunciation of the Defense Department's plans to censor the publication of unclassified research and said Harvard would not accept funds governed by such a restriction.</span></p> <p><span>Thus Harvard falls in line behind three other major research universities--MIT.  Stanford, and Cal Tech--in opposing the proposed rules, which would amount to a basic subverting of long-standing University commitments to free and open inquiry.  The Pentagon proposal would give government officials veto power over the publication of research results funded by the government and deemed to be \"sensitive\" from a national security perspective--an unacceptable proposition given University norms.</span></p> <p><span>The proposed regulations, for one thing, are highly impractical.  The research level is far too early to judge the potential sensitivity of any given information, so the guidelines would be difficult to enforce.  Officials would have to use the gag in an arbitrary manner.</span></p> <p><span>But the question is more one of principle than reality.  Defense Department officials say that the Pentagon funds compose only a small fraction of University research.  Harvard, for instance, only receives about $4 million, a small portion of the more than $100 million the entire federal government doles out here.  But the quest for censorship in this area is indicative of the general Administration instinct concerning information--to suppress it.</span></p> <p><span>The Reagan Administration's effort to establish a lifetime censorship system for more than 100,000 federal employees is only the most blatant example of this trend.  Reagan has also mounted an assault on the Freedom of Information Act--long a tool for watchdogs of the government--including a request to exempt the CIA from FOIA provisions entirely.  He has signed an executive order allowing the CIA and FBI to monitor and infiltrate academic and press institutions.  The Pentagon has ordered employees to take lie-detector tests, in an effort to root out news leaks.</span></p> <p><span>And it was the Reagan Administration that blacked the news media out from the Grenada invasion.</span></p> <p><span>The pat explanation for this unprecedented attack on the country's traditions of free and open debate is national security.  But, as Lecturer on the Core Program Sissela Bok has observed, such efforts to suppress information usually weaken a democratic society--rather than strengthen it.  \"Short of turning an open society into a garrison state,\" she wrote recently in the <i>Crimson,</i> \"it will simply not be possible to restrict trade, scholarship, scientific exchanges, publication and news reporting enough to achieve the desired society.\"</span></p> <p><span>By contrast, the effect of such policies will be the stifling of creativity and the gradual growth of a government unaccountable to its people.  As the traditional bastions of free and uninhibited debate in society, universities can not even give the appearance of accepting restrictions on their research.  Instead they must fight the trend--loudly and openly.  If universities begin to cave in on the principle, other institutions in society surely cannot be far behind.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Give Women Athletes An Even Break | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>HEN THE Reagan Administration argued in front of the Supreme Court this week for a narrow interpretation of Title IX of the Education Amendment Act of 1972, a law prohibiting sexual discrimination by any university receiving federal funds, it abandoned its passive disdain for women's rights in favor of an active hostility toward them.</span></p> <p><span>Although we hope President Reagan stumbles over the gender gap in November, the recent decision is a dangerous precedent that threatens to outlive his tenure.  Under the new ruling, universities may sexually discriminate so long as it is not in a program receiving any federal aid.  This could lead to among other things, unequal treatment of women in hiring decisions, class selection, where limited, and athletics.  Whereas previously Title IX insured the equal funding of both men's and women's sports, women's groups and civil liberties organizations are now predicting the revised law will lead to the demise of women's athletics.  The ruling should hit women athletes especially hard in large universities that do not always share the Ivy League's commitment to women's sports, and spend larger sums for prominent men's programs such as football and basketball.</span></p> <p><span>In the past, the threat of a termination in federal funds was government's most potent weapon with which to whip discriminatory institutions into line.  Now, with all the teeth taken out of the ruling and the absence of an Equal Rights Amendment, women have virtually no recourse to legal protection during their years of education, having to rely instead, as one activist put it, \"on good will rather than the law.\"</span></p> <p><span>The ruling highlights not only the endangered status of women's equality, but also the growing conservatism of the Supreme Court.  Having already appointed one justice, Reagan, if reelected, will have the opportunity to make as many as four appointments to the Court, insuring that his peculiar brand of conservatism will remain ensconced in federal judgement long after he returns to California.</span></p> <p><span>Fortunately, the damage can be undone.  Several Congressmen have already introduced legislation stipulating the termination of all federal funds to any university found sexually discriminating, and we urge Congress to move swiftly to pass the bill.</span></p> <p><span>And voters should keep in mind that November's Presidential race will profoundly influence not only the Executive Branch, but the Judicial one as well.</span></p>"}
{"title": "An Acid Reign | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>HAT GOES UP, must come downs.</span></p> <p><span>That much, almost everyone in the acid-rain game agrees upon.  But that's about all.</span></p> <p><span>There is no doubt that coal-burning power plants account for about 70 percent of the 24 tons of sulfur dioxide dumped into the air of the Midwest and Northeast each year.  There is no doubt that this sulfur dioxide is carried hundreds of miles away, with a final resting place somewhere in northeastern North America.  And there is no doubt that acid rain has engendered an international--and international--debate marked by some appropriately acerbic rhetoric.</span></p> <p><span>For aside from the fact that sulfur dioxide goes up, and acid rain comes down, the coal producers, utilities, environmentalists, and politicians involved agree on virtually nothing.</span></p> <p><span>After nearly a decade of research, the effects of acid rain on the lakes and forests of the Northeast are still not clear.  The Canadian Government and environmentalists in this country insist that acid rain is killing millions of fish and trees.  American electric utilities and coal producers dispute this conclusion.  And for two years, the Reagan Administration equivocated, claiming that not enough research had been done to take a position.  Last June, though, two reports on acid rain from two prestigious sources changed the whole complexion of the conflict.</span></p> <p><span>The first report--released on June 24--was prepared by a blue-ribbon panel appointed by Presidential Science Advisor George Keyworth II Concluded the committee.  \"If we take the conservative point of view that we must wait until scientific knowledge is definite, the accumulated deposition [of acid rain] and damaged environment may reach the point of 'irreversibility.\"  The recommendation:  \"Steps should be taken now which will result in meaningful reductions in the emissions of sulfur compounds into the atmosphere, beginning with those steps which are most cost-effective in reducing total [acid rain] deposition.\"</span></p> <p><span>The committee expressed special concern for the yet unknown effects of acid rain on the microorganisms in soil that break down natural wastes into carbon and nitrogen.  Committee Chairman William A. Neirenberg--director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography--called this \"a worrisome thing...that you're not going to sit around and wait 20 years\" to confirm.</span></p> <p><span>It was a bad week for the Reagan Administration.  On June 29, a study from the National Research Council--an arm of the National Academy of Sciences--concluded that reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide from coal-burning power plants and factories will significantly reduce acid rain, which has probably contributed to the death of lakes and forests in the Northeast and Canada.  Further, the NRC said that 90 to 95 percent of acid rain in North America comes from man-made sources, notably smokestacks and car exhausts.  Finally, acid rain varies in direct proportion to the amount of sulfur dioxide in the air; reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by X, and acid rain will be reduced by X also.</span></p> <p><span>The reports--both prepared by distinguished scientists--leave no doubt about the seriousness of the acid-rain threat.  Whether to act is no longer the issue--how to act is.</span></p> <p><span>Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William Ruckelshaus promised action by August 1. August passed without an announcement.  So did September.  Finally, at a conference in mid-October, Ruckelshsus said there was to hope for quick action on acid rain.  He told the group that the Cabinet Council on Natural Resources--a White House task force--had twice vetoed his proposals, and that he found \"we were dealing with a very big, very controversial action.\"</span></p> <p><span>In a week effort to appease the Canadians, Reagan, in his State of the Union message this January, dared to be cautious:  he requested $50 million for an experimental program designed to neutralize dangerously acidic lakes.  To date, then, Reagan's record on acid rain has been marked by inaction and political expediency.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>BOUT TWO DOZEN bills concerning acid rain are now pending in both houses of Congress, and virtually all call for reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions.  Although officially united in opposition to any new legislation, two major lobbying groups--the National Coal Association and the Edison Electric Institute--are privately divided over possible reduction plans.</span></p> <p><span>The internecine conflict with NCA pits high-sulfur coal producers in the East versus low-sulfur coal producers in the West.  A partial solution to the acid rain problem is to increase use of low-sulfur coal, which creates less sulfur dioxide emission.  But high-sulfur coal producers argue that such a move will cost them more than 40,000 mining jobs, and nearly four times that number in related fields.</span></p> <p><span>Officially, then, the high-sulfur group is against any new legislation which would mandate reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions.  In private, however, the lobby hints that, if push comes to shove, it would opt for legislation requiring the installation of costly scrubbers in coal-burning power plants--thereby obviating the need for low-sulfur coal.</span></p> <p><span>Very much aware of their compatriots' intentions, the low-sulfur producers have formed another lobbying group:  Alliance for Clean Energy, which advocates the use of low-sulfur coal.</span></p> <p><span>The two methods of sulfur emissions reduction most often mentioned--using low-sulfur coal or installing scrubbers--both carry unseen but heavy baggage, political and economic.  Utility spokesmen in states that produce high-sulfur coal say they cannot afford to ignore regulatory commissions sensitive to miners and their unions.  And under the 1970 Clean Air Act, state governors can stop utilities from using out-of-state coal.</span></p> <p><span>Economic considerations make scrubbers an unattractive option.  A typical scrubber costs about a third of the price of a new coal-burning power plant, and uses 5 to 8 percent of the plant's electrical output.  In addition, most scrubbers themselves produce an undesirable pollutant:  calcium sulfite.</span></p> <p><span>The last plan proposed by EPA Administrator Ruckelshaus would have reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 3.4 million tons (less than a third of the environmentalists demands) at a cost of $1.5 to $2.5 billion.  Budget Director David Stockman says that even such a modest program is too expensive.  He flippantly charges that such a plan would cost taxpayers \"$5000 a fish.\"</span></p> <p><span>Some Congressmen have meanwhile gone ahead on the issue.  A bill co-sponsored by Democrats Henry Waxman and Gerald Sikorski spreads the burden of paying for emissions reductions.  Under the plan, a 1 cent per kilowatt tax would be levied nationwide on utility customers.  The $2 billion raised by the tax would be used to subsidize scrubbers for the dirtiest Midwestern power plants.  Tax revenues would finance nearly 90 percent of the cost of the scrubbers, which could reduce sulfur-dioxide emissions by about 40 percent in 10 years' time.</span></p> <p><span>But acid rain legislation has thus far been blocked by Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell of Michigan.  He and other Midwestern congressmen contend that most bills would unfairly require their constituents to foot the bill for reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions.</span></p> <p><span>Dingell has been myopically intransigent on this matter, and it's time that he started compromising.  For one thing, Congress will eventually have to address the acid rain problem anyway.  But more important, a consensus on the issue among Democrats could prove an asset at the polls this fall.</span></p> <p><span>The Waxman bill--or something like it--probably provides the best hope for a bipartisan acid rain plan.  It wisely minimizes conflict between regions and interest groups by fairly spreading the burden of reducing sulfur-dioxide emissions.</span></p> <p><span>Utilities favor a tax on fossil fuels, as car exhausts are partly implicated in acid rain.  The proposal might be a good addition to a compromise, \"spread the burden\" plan.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT THE CHIEF obstacle to an acid rain bill is currently the Reagan Administration.  By systematically ignoring the acid rain, the Administration has fumbled one of its few opportunities for favorable publicity on the environmental front.  The results are in and Reagan can no longer legitimately plead ignorance on the issue.  Any more foot dragging is an insult to anyone concerned with America's natural resources, and to out northern neighbor.</span></p>"}

Instead of working to reduce the possibility of a nuclear end, Reagan has increased the likelihood of that end.  He has done his atmost to alienate us from not only the Soviet leadership, but its citizens as well.  He has spent three years stalling the arms control talks.  And he has launched us on a massive nuclear build-up, including research and development of nuclear arsenals in space.</span></p> <p><span>We started the nuclear arms race, and have led every step of the way.  Every new weapons system has given the world <i>less</i> security and taken more control over our lives away from us.  The fate of the Earth will be decided by split-second decisions by U.S and Soviet computers.  Mutually Assured Destruction was achieved years ago.  The push to go any further beyond that point indicates an unwillingness to understand the difference between bows and arrows and nuclear weapons.  Such an unwillingness points to a profound indifference to life.  In that indifference.  I suggest that our President represents a minority opinion. <b>Bob Strempel</b></span></p>"}

{"title": "Passionate Symbolism | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>hat is so fundamentally disturbing about the Reagan Administration is that it is the present embodiment of the American Dream.  Doonesbury's Duane Delacourt, in charge of symbolism for Carter and Brown, was a parody of the symbols the Left still has to offer--tired repetitions of the idea that politics could be groovy as well as homespun.  But what Reagan has done--and it must be seen as some kind of bizarre triumph--has been to reclaim the remnants of the symbolism of the right:  the we're-the-really-good-guys syndrome that descends directly from Jefferson and Hoover.  And he has accommodated them to the new ground of television, where the heart of the present American lies.  We are an America of exit polls, of projection counts, or personality interviews, Reagan knows just how to capture that side of us.  He strategically buys time on Saturdays to talk to us, he uses down home language, and he clothes failure and success in the language of stability.  In \"standing tall,\" Reagan projects and personifies the psychological reassurance that America craves in this age of nukes and economic calamity.</span></p> <p><span>Robert Dallek's <i>Ronald Reagan:  The Politics of Symbolism,</i> shows this psychological mastery to be the principal Reagan strength.  Reagan is portrayed in the \"ideologue as politician,\" a package of symbolic responses that fit an American need to feel good.  Unlike other more traditional books on Reagan--for instance, Lou Cannon's <i>Reagan</i>--Dallek's is a psychological portrait that seeks to explain Reagan's image of himself and the image he portrays to others.</span></p> <p><span>Dallek, a UCLA professor, begins by pausing briefly, but crucially, to examine Reagan's autobiography <i>Where is the Rest of Me?,</i> and a particular episode in which Reagan, a young schoolboy in Dixon, Illinois, remembers seeing his father drunk on the back door-step.  The example is illustrative of his general approach; Dallek retrieves from this incident the basic Reagan ethic of self-reliance that Dallek asserts pervades Reagan's policies as president.  Moving onward, Dallek tries to show a panoply of instances in which Reagan actions reflect deep-seated personal values.  He wants to find the bases of Reagan's abstractionist thought.  What explains Reagan's harsh anti-Soviet evangelism?  Dallek asks, as an example.  \"Reagan's rhetoric and actions suggest that in some fundamental way it is a symbolic protest against the state of his own nation.\" Dallek, in fact, shows rather convincingly that the entire plan of the Reagan administration is really based on two convictions:  that big government that discourages personal initiative is wrong and should be demolished, and that the Soviet Union is the extreme example of what America might be if problem one is not soon eradicated.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>hile Dallek incisively analyzes Reagan's symbolism, he does not, however, sufficiently show the connection between Reagan's values and what America <i>thinks</i> it needs.  As other analysts have done less elegantly, Dallek depicts Reagan's symbolism as incredibly simplistic.  But why has the sell worked?  Here, Dallek is no more probing than the hundreds of other pundits who have asked the same question, and in the end he leaves us nothing but his liberal bitterness.  \"Reaganomics doesn't work,\" he proclaims like the rest of the pundits, wondrous at the country's \"gullibility.\"  But the point is that we have bought Reaganomics.  And we can't put the blame solely on the hard right, no matter what the eggheads think.  Reagan swept 44 states in 1980, a fact that mystifies Dallek.  \"Despite the fact that effective presidents have been more the exception than the rule in our history,\" he states, \"it is difficult to believe that a nation of 226 million people cannot find a more rational, thoughtful and energetic leader with greater self-awareness and a better grip on national and international realities.\"  True enough, but Dallek fails to reach deeper than his liberal frustration to explain the hold Reaganism exerts on the country.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Dallek's psychoanalytic approach is not without merit.  In describing the Reagan symbolism, Dallek has hit upon the political nerve that makes him in some ways the Jonathan Schell of anti-Reaganism.  Dallek, like the antinuke writer, is trying to assess the psychological impact of a horrible danger--in this case, Reagan's policies.  Moreover, like Schell, Dallek describes in encyclopedic detail the features of his awful portrait of the Reagan phenomenon--a survey which reveals journalists and pundits sometimes shocked, sometimes disbelieving, and sometimes simply sardonically amused.  The value of the Dallek survey is that, like Schell's <i>Fate of The Earth,</i> it shows the breadth of the Reagan game--the extent to which his is a government of symbols, the depth of the problem.  If Dallek, like Schell, seems to offer no realistic solutions, you can't fault him for it.  If the success of Reaganism has shown anything, it is that it is hard to beat pure emotion with thoughtful analysis.  Dallek's quandary is well phrased by Year's oft-quoted words:  \"The best lack all conviction but the worst are filled with a passionate intensity.\" Despite Dallek's best efforts, how to beat back Reagan's passionate intensity remains an unanswered question.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Second Guessing | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>H</b>ow much does television affect American politics?  Ever since the 1960 Presidential campaign, the question has haunted the election process.  John F. Kennedy '40 very effectively used the fledgling medium, and a a result he has often been called the first \"TV President.\"  This claim has some validity; JFK's campaign received a real boost from the famous Nixon Kennedy debates, among the first such affairs ever broadcast to a national audience.  Currently, it is hard to forget Ronald Reagan's description as the \"Great Communicator\" when he appears in his element--behind a podium delivering a prepared speech.</span></p> <p><span>But, while people often discuss the impact of televised advertisements, debates, and exit polling, no one seems to ever do anything about it.  First Amendment freedoms are assumed, almost off handedly, to be sufficient protection for the broadcast media during election years.</span></p> <p><span>But danger of this complacent faith in the First Amendment became apparent last week in the aftermath of the lowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.  The House Telecommunications Subcommittee has been holding hearings this year concerning the effect of TV projections on final vote tallies.  The problem first received widespread attention after the 1980 Presidential contest, when President Jimmy Carter's early concession prompted as much as two per cent of the Western electorate to stay home, according to several studies.  Although this probably didn't cause Carter's defeat, the results of state-level contests may have been decisively affected.  The practice of spot-polling voters as they leave the polls, and instantaneous transmission of the results to TV screens, may have had the same discouraging effect.</span></p> <p><span>This alleged distortion of election returns is what the Telecommunications Subcommittee has been studying.  The chairman. Rep. Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.), sent a letter after the February 20 lowa caucuses to the presidents of the three major networks.  In the letter, Wirth recommended that the networks show \"restraint\" in broadcasting election results before voters have cast their ballots.  He also invited the network presidents to testify at hearings on the Monday preceding the New Hampshire primary, and the networks each sent a representative.</span></p> <p><span>Closer to home.  Massachusetts Attorney General Michael Connolly has tentatively proposed a bill which would actually prohibit TV stations from projecting voting results until the poll have closed.</span></p> <p><span>Both Connolly and the Congressional subcommittee understand some of the flaws of the present system.  In his letter Wirth addressed the heart of the issue.  \"To put it simply, in scores, if not hundreds, of rooms where caucuses were occurring, Iowa voters were told what the results would be before and during their decision-making process.\"</span></p> <p><span>The legendary deluge of reporters on New Hampshire produced almost the same outcome--extensive and frequent updates of exit polling throughout the day.  Sen. Gary W. Hart's (D-Colo.) surprising victory margin became apparent quite early in the afternoon.</span></p> <p><span>These facts demand that society look long and hard at the possible implications for modern democracy.  Do TV projections discourage voters favorable to the losing candidate from going to the polls?  Do they also scare away voters favorable to the apparent winner by making them feel overconfident?  Do voters for an underdog turn out early, and in large numbers, precisely because they share Wirth's and Connolly's opinion and hope to push their candidate to victory in spite of expectations?</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>his \"second guessing\" effect of polls lies at the heart of the problem and Wirth alludes to it--perhaps inadvertently--that the first projection in Iowa. by CBS News, was broadcast at 8:12 PM-18 minutes before the caucuses even began.  The other two networks quickly followed.  NBC a few minutes later and ABC at 8.46.  Significantly, these projections differed radically from the ranking of just the day before.</span></p> <p><span>The medium is not the message.  It never has been, in the competitive and lucrative American media.  The New Hampshire returns embarrassed the national press more than any other recent event.  After predicting the winner incorrectly, the networks received insult added to injury through Hart's record-breaking margin.  It's simply impossible to conjecture that the networks did anything other than report the facts as they saw them; any other approach would be vulnerable to ruthless exposure by a competitor.  And any media organization, however small, which had correctly predicted the return would have made the election scoop of the century.</span></p> <p><span>Thus Wirth and Connolly misplace their criticism.  If the voters who said weeks ago that they would vote for Mondale actually did on election day, the projections would have been borne out, as they partially were in Iowa.  It is somewhat perverse to blame the press, even in part, for Mondale's failure in the Granite State.  It's like saying that predicting the truth turns the truth into a lie.</span></p> <p><span>The problem lies not in the exhaustive surveying and reporting of the well-staffed networks, but in the failure of voters to do what they told reporters they would do.  As far as election day itself, if true New Hampshire Mondale supporters had seen the TV projection of Hart's growing lead by midafternoon, one hopes they would have felt even more motivated to go to the polls, believing (ironically because of the previous projections themselves) that New Hampshire Democrats are largely Mondale Democrats in the first place and that something wrong must be happening.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Cap and George | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>T IS amazing when people are amazed over how fast the mighty can be cut low and the lowly exalted in the world of Washington politics.  It happens all the time, as Walter F. Mondale and Sen. Gary W. Hart (D-Colo.) are proving right now.</span></p> <p><span>But even in the rarified atmosphere of Capital Hill reputation mongering, the most jaded cynic can't help but be bemused over the rollercoaster ride the reputations of three so-called giants of national security policy have taken over the past decade.  The melodrama of Cap and George and Henry the K--reaching one of its most interesting chapters in recent months--goes to show once again just how transitory stature in Washington can be, how fleeting prevailing wisdom really is, and, perhaps most fascinating, how little general smarts, can matter in foreign and defense policy.</span></p> <p><span>You remember, of course, Casper W. Weinberger '38 and George Shultz.  They first made it big in the halcyon days of the Nixon White House Cap was \"Cap the Knife,\" Nixon's \"chief executor of sacred cows,\" in <i>Newsweek's</i> words.  A fiscal conservative, but a Rockefeller liberal, they said, a man who took the surgeon's knife to the vast bureaucracy at the Federal Trade Commission, then the Office of Management and Budget, and finally the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.  \"He's no ideologue,\" said one liberal congressman when Weinberger was named Defense Secretary three years ago.  \"He was one of the people who made things work.\"  \"He was the man who would sculpt the Pentagon into a mean, but lean, fighting force.</span></p> <p><span>This is exactly the same image that had been cultivated by George Shultz up until his appointment to succeed Alexander M. Haig as Secretary of State Shultz was the giant of domestic policy in the Nixon Administration--\"a careful listener, a former academic who has become, in the estimate of his friends in government and business, a master manager with an uncanny knack for getting the best of people,\" said <i>Newsweek.</i>  His resume was as impressive if not more so than Weinbergers':  Secretary of Labor, head of the Office of Management Budget, and Secretary of the Treasury, where he negotiated a trade agreement with the Russians, making influential friends in European capitals along the way.</span></p> <p><span>Two obviously smart guys.  Two similar guys, not only do their resumes sound the same, they both worked for the engineering behemoth Bechtel, when they weren't stomping in and out of the Oval Office.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT in the fast paced elevator that is Washington, their fall from grace has been swift and severe.  And just as quickly, another fallen star, Henry A. Kissinger '50, may rise again.</span></p> <p><span>Weinberger is the easiest to pick at, because, by most accounts, he is one of the worst defense secretaries ever.  He is not stupid, nor have his policy proposals, in their own may, been insignificant.  By pressuring unremmittingly for a huge arms build-up, he has redefined the debate on defense spending.  The question is no longer do we have increases of a few percent in the budget; it is do we increase it by more than 10 percent or not.</span></p> <p><span>But it is his very inflexibility on the Pentagon budget that reveals the heart of the Weinberger problem.  A fascinating article in the <i>National Journal</i> on Weinberger describes how, in the wrangle over the '84 budget, Cap could have struck a deal with congressman for a seven percent real spending increase, but had to settle for five because he refused to compromise.  Even in off-the-record discussions, the article went on to say, Weinberger refuses to recycle anything more than standard Pentagon positions on issues.</span></p> <p><span>In essence, the man is a stonewaller.  It is Weinberger--and his adviser on these issues, former Henry Jackson aide Richard N. Perle--who has quashed even the sightest mention of arms control in the Administration.  It was under his stewardship that the oft-noted Pentagon prediliction for waste has blossomed into a near crisis.  Weapons systems costs are consistently under-budgeted and the procurement process is consistently under fire for over-inflated prices Weinberger's rigidly ideological approach to defense issues has cost him his credibility, and when he speaks, no one listens.</span></p> <p><span><b>S</b>HUTLZ'S fall from grace has been much less obvious or dramatic, but in many ways much more interesting.  After all, Weinberger, for all his supposed bureaucratic skills, was still known, was skill known as a hard-liner on defense.  But Shultz was real giant-killer, the man waiting in the wings all during Haig's failed vicarship, ready to restore cool, business-like leadership to an aggressive U.S. foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span>They're not saying that anymore, though, as Giant George is on the ropes, fighting to last another round.  His stumbling block this last year has been Lebanon, a morass by any measure.  Can you imagine what the second guessers would have done if Jimmy Carter and Cy Vance pursued the policy undertaken by Reagan and Shultz?  Equivocate over whether they like the Israeli invasion or not.  Refuse for a year to acknowledge that Syria has any interests whatsoever in the country.  Send in several hundred marines without a clear idea of what they're doing and get more than 200 of them killed doing it.  And then watch as Syria eats up the country.  Even though Reagan doesn't admit it, the emperor has no clothes, and the people are beginning to know it.</span></p> <p><span>A lot of the blame for the Lebanon fiasco lies with Shultz.  People think that he never fully understood how far the Syrians were willing to go to get their way.  Shultz never showed the requisite leadership to stop the steamroll of events, and, in that sense, deserves to be faulted for the loss of the U.S.'s strategic and moral stature.  Now, as the first faint cries for his resignation are heard, the heretofore \"cool teamplayer\" is starting to flail at Congress on Central American policy.  A drum beat of Foggy Bottom corridor criticism of the secretary is starting to creep into the papers.  This guy may not be so cool after all.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HERE seems some kind of lesson in Shultz and Weinberger's fall from grace.  The man some people think is going to be the next secretary of state--if Reagan makes it to the Oval Office again--is Kissinger, another refugee from the Nixon White House.  He has been called the greatest diplomat in the world, but he earned that title at a terrible human and ethical cost, as journalists like William Shawcross and Seymour Hersh have shown in recent years.  Kissinger is everything Shultz and Weinberger are not.  Where the later are bureaucratically clumsy, the former is manipulative.  Where Winberger and Shultz have their integrity intact, Kissinger is called unscrupulous.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, as Weinberger and Shultz fall, Kissinger rises like the Phoenix.  The Central America Commission leadership is only one manifestation of the rescusitation of his reputation; Kissinger reportedly sees Shultz and Reagan regularly.  It is Kissinger, the scoundrel, who may carry on the Nixon banner, not Shultz or Weinberger, two men of integrity.  Sy Hersh's darts were sharp indeed, but not sharp enough.  They don't matter anymore The American people value competence, and it looks like Cap and George don't measure up.</span></p>"}

Hart should also profit from the lack of any real organized labor in the state, says John Harwood, political reporter for the St. Petersburg Times.  Harwood calls Florida \"really a bunch of city states, a state that's really fragmented and [where] media's really important.\"</span></p> <p><span>Thanks to a ballot the separates the delegate selection vote from the popular vote, Hart may in fact win in Florida without winning a majority of the delegates.

{"title": "Walter Mondale | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>HY DO THE DEMOCRATS like to shoot themselves in the feet?  Every four years, the same questions are raised by the faithfuls as to what the party should stand for and what us the proper tack to beat the Republicans.  And every four years--be it 1968, 1972, 1976, or 1980--the party engages in a massive internal bloodletting.  Not that the questions members beat each other over the head with aren't significant.  They are, Who is the truer liberal?  Who is the most electable in the November run-off?  Democrats have rightly had to struggle among themselves to choose between the Humphrey's and the McCarthy's; the Muskie's and the McGovern's the Carter's and the Kennedy's.</span></p> <p><span>But 1984 is different.</span></p> <p><span>Not in the last twenty years has the party been offered so clear a choice of a candidate who can bridge all its concern and constituencies.  A candidate who is a true-blue liberal.  A candidate who has a keen, working understanding of how government works, of its potentialities and limitations.  And one who, despite what all the pundits say, has as solid a chance as anybody in the race of being elected President in November.</span></p> <p><span>That candidate is Walter F. Mondale.  That the liberal electorate in this country is not rushing to his banner is testimony to the power of fabricated images and the ability of his opponents--namely Sen. Gary W. Hart (D-Colo)--to pull a snow job on the American people.</span></p> <p><span>During his more than twenty years in public series, Mondale has staked out a clear position for himself as an unreconstructed--but thinking man's--liberal, taking the right stands on issues ranging from civil rights and health care to defense spending and labor problems.  And he has done it the hard way--not by acting or sitting in some law office, but by working the political battles from the ground up, fighting tooth and nail over hundreds of issues on his way up from Minnesota attorney general to senator to vice president.</span></p> <p><span>It is true, of course, that for all the differences among the Democratic contenders, any one of them is preferable to another four years of Ronald Reagan.  But it is also important to strip away all the slogans and pieties masking the candidates and to realize that, among the Democratic hopefuls, Mondale offers the most realistic chance of turning around four years of Reaganism after reaching the Oval Office.  After years of internecine strife, the Democratic candidates of 1984 stand fairly close on the issues; but it is only Mondale who has convincingly demonstrated through his long government experience that he can turn a liberal platform into practical policies.  While other candidates talk big, Mondale does big.</span></p> <p><span>In terms of civil rights, for instance, Mondale has been far ahead in the game, making the case for racial integration when the cause was not all that popular.  He was one of the sponsors of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and introduced fair housing legislation in 1967 and 1968.  And then in the early '70s--as the idea of civil rights took a beating with the advent of the anti-busing movement--Mondale chaired a Senate Committee that pushed for new aid for school desegregation, Mondale was also one of the original writers of Medicaid legislation, and he helped create the Legal Services Corporation, which Reagan has since tried to gut.</span></p> <p><span>Mondale has also been a longstanding critic of Pentagon waste.  And while Hart has made a name for himself as a \"defense reformer\", Mondale was talking about these issues long before the Colorado senator began proselytizing his new ideas.  As a senator, Mondale led the fight against MIRVs and the B-1 bomber, and as vice president he lobbied successfully for a presidential veto of congressional authorization of billions of dollars for a nuclear aircraft carrier, an issue Hart claims to have taken the lead on.</span></p> <p><span>It's no accident that Mondale has been endorsed by a host of party leaders; they know him as a man of his word who turns ideas into policy through politics as it ought to be practiced--through coalition building and compromising that makes up good government--not by posturing.  Democrats this year should reject the pathetic backlash against government experience and leadership that seems to arise among the electorate every four years and leads to presidents like Reagan.</span></p> <p><span>Mondale, it is true, offers a traditional New Deal-style platform, but what is so bad about that?  Domestically, he supports more money for social programs--much of which means restoring Reagan budget cuts in programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children.  He wants to direct more than $10 billion to solve problems of education, including stepping up math and science scholarship and improving classroom teaching.  He plans to put back money Reagan cut from water and land conservation programs, and cleaning up toxic waste.  In addition to supporting traditional Democratic jobs programs, Mondale acknowledges the need for \"industrial policy,\" proposing long-term business/labor/government cooperation in resuscitating basic industries.  Abroad, he offers a moderate foreign policy which emphasizes negotiations over the Reagan big stick approach on the Soviet Union and Central America.  Mondale backs a nuclear freeze, and wants to give developing countries economic aid--not arms.</span></p> <p><span>To finance these ambitious programs, Mondale advocates tax reform and cutting back in defense spending.  Mondale wants to reduce the budget deficit through a combined program of:  eliminating weapons systems like the MX missile and the B-1; across-the-board hospital cost containment; repealing tax code indexation; and capping the third year of Reagan's tax cut for the rich.</span></p> <p><span>Certain parts of the platform are ill-advised - principally Mondale's support for domestic content legislation.  But in general we like the way Mondale actively affirms that government is the solution--the basic liberal premise--while Hart trumpets a message that hedges on the central question of whether government is something you campaign for or against.</span></p> <p><span>Mondale has taken a lot of abuse for being beholden to so-called special interests, but what does that mean?  He has accepted endorsements by organized labor, teachers and womens groups, prominent minorities, and party leaders--backing any one of his opponents would have taken at a moment's notice.  These are not ill-gotten friends--they are among the foremost groups being assaulted by Reagan, and Mondale should be proud for their support.</span></p> <p><span>Why should the Democrats go against their interests once again and nominate someone like Hart, who hasn't shown he has the capacity to translate intriguing ideas into tangible policy.  We ask the same of McGovern, whom we respect for his idealism but don't believe has shown the requisite understanding for translating that idealism into policy.  The Hart juggernaut is far from unstoppable; that's what they said about Mondale only two weeks ago.  The race is far from over.  Democrats in Massachusetts should vote for Mondale on Tuesday.  In doing so, they would only be following their best instincts and traditions.</span></p>"}

Professor Hoffmann is described as an unremitting pacifist despite the clear statement in his book <i>Duties Beyond Borders</i> that \"while I am not a pacifist...I have a strong belief that no war is very often better than war.\"  In his letter of 8 March Prof. Womack has already rebutted the \"false accusations\" that he organised the Grenada demonstration, but it appears that Mr. Lagon considers even speaking at such a meeting to be inconsistent with a faculty position.  At a gathering outside of his normal academic responsibilities John Womack surely has a right to criticise President Reagan (as has Richard Pipes, for example, in his support of Reagan), particularly in a political environment which effectively proscribes widespread dissemination of left-wing opinions on the mainstream political agenda.</span></p> <p><span>Further, the assessment within the letter that \"a virtual monopoly of political thought and discussion has been achieved by the left wing of the students and faculty\" does not stand up to scrutiny.  Given that the Harvard Admissions Policy does not take political leanings into account, one would assume that the political bias of Harvard students is at least partially representative of educated American youth.  The statement that \"those who are conservative or moderate are few in number\" therefore suggests that the author's term \"leftist\" encompasses an extraordinarily broad spectrum of political opinion.

{"title": "Gary Hart | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>L</b>AST OCTOBER 1, all the Democratic Presidential hopefuls were in Maine, begging for votes from party activists assembled that day to conduct a straw poll beauty pageant all the candidates except Sen. Gary W Hart (D-Colo) Hart was in New Hampshire with a busload of college-age volunteers.  And while Walter F. Mondale.  Sen John H Glenn (D-Ohio).  Sen Alan M Cranston (D-Calif) and George S. McGovern hobnobbed with the Maine party establishment at a party sponsored cocktail party.  Hart threw a party for his student workers at a Manchester ski lodge.</span></p> <p><span>Mondale swept that straw poll and a few others, but today it is Hart who is in the limelight.  Despite the best efforts of the Democratic National Committee, governors, senators, and Congressmen around the country.  Hart is on the verge of pulling off one of the greatest political upsets in American history.</span></p> <p><span>One cannot help but be excited by a man who challenged the seemingly unstoppable bureaucratic machine that was the Mondale candidacy and won.  The party fashioned a delegate selection process that was supposed to snuff out underdogs like Hart.  But the men in the back rooms made one mistake; the picked a man whom no one wanted, a man who called for a return normalcy when the American electorate had elected Ronald Reagan precisely to get away from that normalcy.</span></p> <p><span>No we do not wholly swallow the \"new ideas\" message that Hart has promulgated.  We do not find it significant that he is eight years younger than the hardly senile Mondale nor do we wish to participate in a generational political war with our parents and grandparents.</span></p> <p><span>We support Hart for two separate though complementary reasons.  His platform on a wide range of issues shows he is not content to take the facile route of traditional New Deal liberalism or to embrace the cynical neo-conservative backlash.  Hart is, quite simply, too intelligent to embrace the well-meaning but unrealistic proposals of Mondale and McGovern.  But, unlike Glenn, he does not believe that the Democrats should try to regain the White House by becoming milk toast Republicans.  We also support Hart because he is now the only man who can send Reagan back to his ranch for good.</span></p> <p><span>Many complain that Hart does not address issues.  Yet, for a full year he talked issues, often to one or two people at a Manchester eatery or to gas station attendants, but rarely was he given air time.</span></p> <p><span>Hart is clearly the strongest candidate on defense issues.  He is largely non-interventionist, but his desire to avoid military involvement does not stem from McGovern-like isolationist sentiment (\"America come home\").  In the Senate, Hart has been on the front line of legislators fighting for the production of less expensive, less sophisticated out more mobile weaponry.  While advocating a defense increase of about four percent--the same as Mondale--Hart has argued his case in terms of <i>what</i> the money is spent on.  Hart led a 1983 filibuster against the MX missile, opposed the B1 bomber and the M-1 tank, fought for the SALT II treaty, and introduced legislation calling for a worldwide freeze on the manufacture of plutonium that could be used by terrorists to build nuclear weapons.  Hart, in 1982, opposed the construction of two large aircraft carriers, arguing instead for more usable and less vulnerable smaller craft.  In foreign policy, Hart opposed U.S. backing of Nicaraguan contras, called for the removal of U.S. marines from Lebanon <i>before</i> more than 250 were killed by a truck bomb.  He has opposed the spread of technology that is suitable for weapons use, and has proposed negotiations on way to reduce the possibilities of an accidental nuclear war.</span></p> <p><span>Hart also supports the freeze, but, unlike Mondale, he does not wallow in its symbolism, or pretend that a freeze can be easily negotiated.  Despite increasingly hysterical charges by Mondale that Hart is the dupe of Reagan's legislative ploy to pass the MX missile proposal.  Hart voted <i>against</i> the Reagan MX missile build-down program on October 31, 1983.</span></p> <p><span>On domestic issues, Hart has remained steadfastly liberal while steering clear of special interest lobbying.  Despite widespread criticism from labor.  Hart refused to support protectionist measures, including tariffs and local content legislation.  Mondale supports both.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, Hart proposes using tax incentives to retrain workers and encourage industry to modernize.  But unlike many, including Reagan, he does not want to abandon the traditional \"smokestack\" producers in the process.  Hart is an early backer of Kennedy School lecturer Robert B. Reich's \"industrial policy\" to rejuvenate ailing industries using the government to negotiate compacts between management, labor, and the financial markets.  Hart has also proposed a reform in entitlement programs to cut costs, and has advocated an active Federal Reserve Board to target interest rates to promote economic growth.</span></p> <p><span>For all the policy talk, there is not that much that separates the only two real candidates.  Unlike 1968 and 1972, no single issue holds sway, and ideology is now a word associated with the Republicans.  Even Mondale, his candidacy disappearing like water through a sieve, would concede that he and Hart differ only superficially on the bread and butter issues.</span></p> <p><span>The difference is more subtle and more important.  Hart is the best man to defeat Reagan, because he is uncluttered with the remnants of the Democratic past.  One must be wary of a candidate who ends his speeches with a climatic \"I am ready to be President\" or \"Hubert Humphrey was like a father to me.\"  Mondale consciously huddles in the shadow of Hamphrey and, while muttering the name \"Jimmy Carter\" only in muted tones, advocates a Carter platform that was soundly repudiated by the American electorate in 1980.  We are cynical about Mondale's call for a \"return\" to an American before Reagan, because he does not convince us that what he offers is any more than a replay of the failed Carter Presidency.</span></p> <p><span>Hart like John F. Kennedy '40, represents the diametric opposite of his Republican opponent.  Kennedy triumphed over a craggy Richard M. Nixon, and Hart can triumph over a 73-year-old Reagan.  Furthermore, Harts, distance from the party establishment--most of which fell into the Mondale trap--guarantees that he will not be doomed to follow the same worn political path.  Mondale spent a lifetime carefully climbing up through the party, making the right friends, allying himself with the party establishment and reviving the old labor alliance.  He is a player, not leader.</span></p> <p><span>We do not embrace Hart as a new Kennedy.  That would be native, and ultimately disappointing, for not even Kennedy lived up to his myth.  We embrace Hart for his intelligence, his foresight, his proposals and for his refusal to fall in line with the party bureaucracy.</span></p>"}
{"title": "George McGovern | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>A</b>S THE DEMOCRATIC Presidential nominee in 1972.  George s. McGovern stood for active, compassionate government at home, thoughtful, non-interventionist policies abroad, and a Democratic Party committed to the needs of the underprivileged.</span></p> <p><span>In 1984, as a candidate for the nomination, he still does, and that consistent, principled vision of America's future is itself one of the strongest reasons to vote for the former senator in tomorrow's primary.  Since entering politics in the early 1950s.  McGovern has been a forceful and articulate proponent of what is best in the liberal tradition of the Democratic Party, and he has not let the cynicism of the Reagan era sway him from those convictions.  Amid a pack of hopefuls tripping over themselves in their eagerness to disassociate themselves from traditional Democratic concerns.  McGovern has force fully reaffirmed his standing as \"a liberal.\"</span></p> <p><span>This year's race is characteristic of the courageous stands McGovern has taken throughout his political career.  While others are campaigning against \"big government,\" the South Dakotan has been unafraid to asset that government can, and should, play an important guiding role.  McGovern advocates vigorous government action to combar poverty and hunger, aid education, advance equal rights for women and minorities, and protect the environment.  Other Democratic candidates have pledged to support these causes as well but McGovern stands alone in his gutsy proposals to compensate for increased spending in these sectors by slashing government handouts to other, more politically powerful interests.</span></p> <p><span>Where other candidates have promised to limit Defense budget <i>increases</i> McGovern vows to <i>cut</i> military spending 20 to 25 percent.  The reduction would come from halting production of the M-X. the B-1 and the space warfare program, and from requiring U.S. allies to assume a greater portion of legitimate costs of mutual security.  Nor has McGovern steered clear of other sacred cows, he has said he will freeze Social Security and other non-need-based entitlement programs to reduce federal deficits.  Farmers would no longer receive subsidies to limit production; instead, the government would buy surpluses and distribute them to alleviate hunger at home and abroad.  McGovern also supports the installation of a flat tax rate, designed to eliminate loopholes, increase revenue and, ultimately, be fairer than the present convoluted tax codes.</span></p> <p><span>Internationally, McGovern is a strong of Reagan-style adventurism.  He is currently the strongest \"peace candidate\" in the race, advocating not only a nuclear freeze, but also that the U.S. take immediate unilateral steps to halt the arms race.  He urges a complete Marine withdrawal from Lebanon--a move he called for well in advance of most other candidates and before the bombing of the Marine compound--and the complete termination of all U.S. military operations in Central America.  What makes these foreign policy positions all the more credible is that they are wholly consistent with McGovern's past positions--positions that have consistently born out his sound judgement.  For example, McGovern was among the first Congressmen to criticize U.S. intervention in Vietnam, an opposition which became the overriding issue in the 1972 campaign.  McGovern's early calls for the recognition of mainland China and peaceful coexistence with Fidel Castro's Cuba have also become testament to McGovern's foresight in foreign policy matters.</span></p> <p><span>In short, McGovern has established a long track record of public service that is consistent both internally, and with the enlightened ideals of the Democratic Party.  It is recognizing this that forced most of McGovern's opposition to focus not on his platform, but on so called political realities.  \"A vote for McGovern, is a vote for Reagan,\" and \"He'll never get elected\" are frequent rejoinders to would-be McGovern backers.  But to accept this cynical wisdom is misguided on several counts.  First, if political history--and most recently the New Hampshire primary--has shown anything, it is that as the saying goes, \"the opera ain't over until the fat lady sings.\"  McGovern finished only a slight margin behind Gary Hart in the Iowa caucuses, annd it is premature at best to rule him out of the race.  Second, and more important, this strategic approach fundamentally distorts the purpose and significance of a primary election.</span></p> <p><span>\"Anyone but Reagan\" has been the Democratic rallying cry this year and, no doubt, when the general election takes place in November, most Democrats will ink in that anybody.  But tomorrow's election is a Democratic primary--a time for Democratic voters to signal not only which candidate they prefer, but also what direction they believe the party should take.  More than any other Democratic contender, McGovern represents the principled and humane outlook that has typically distinguished the Democratic Party from the Republicans in general, and Ronald Reagan in particular.</span></p> <p><span>In this context, a vote for McGovern takes on a symbolic importance beyond the immediate issue of the former senator's candidacy.  That McGovern has said he will drop out of the race if he does not fare well in Massachusetts makes the issue all the more pressing; he has provided a distinctive and intelligent voice in the campaign, forcing the other candidates to tackle tough issues.  By doing so, and by demonstrating that it is possible to run a race with principled integrity, McGovern has strengthened not only his candidacy, but the Democratic Party as well.</span></p> <p><span>In Iowa, McGovern appealed to Democrats not to \"throw away their conscience.\"  We can only strengthen this appeal by urging Massachusetts Democrats not to throw away their votes.</span></p>"}

The real issue is the arms race versus the human race.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Unilateral Freeze</b></span></p> <p><span>McGovern made no allusion to domestic policy in his short statement, instead emphasizing his defense platform--an immediate unilateral nuclear freeze, withdrawal of troops from Central America, and a 25 percent cut in the defense budget.</span></p> <p><span>Looking tan and cheerful on the podium amidst the biggest rally of the Massachusets campaign, McGovern jabbed at his current opponent and 1972 campaign manager, Sen.

{"title": "Keeping An Eye on the Children | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE ELECTION of Ronald Reagan in 1980 signalled a full-scale attack on the needs and benefits of groups with limited political clout.  The poor saw life saving social programs they had won in the past 50 years gradually stripped away their ethics and diligence impugned even their hunger termed illusory Minorities, women and gays witnessed growing discrimination in the workplace and in the government.  The disabled were stripped of many of the rehabilitation programs the government had sponsored in the '60s and '70s.</span></p> <p><span>Now these groups are mobilizing against the President, and fighting back.  But members of the group which has arguably been the hardest-hit in the past four years cannot mobilize on their own.  They have no PACs, no national recognition.  They cannot march, or picket, or write books.  They cannot even vote.</span></p> <p><span>The children and youth of America are politically mute, and for this reason have suffered the worst onslaught from the policies of the current Administration Reagan has consistently ignored and misinterpreted the problems of children.</span></p> <p><span>In the past four years.  Reagan cut funds for education and student loans, child care programs, food programs, for children, and youth employment programs.  He cancelled the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) which included major youth job programs while youth unemployment was growing; he tried to have child labor regulations relaxed to allow employers to demand longer hours under worse conditions, he campaigned for a sub-minimum wage for young people.  And he tried to eliminate the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and finally reduced its funds by 30 percent.</span></p> <p><span>William S. Loiry, a professional youth advocate, last month published a book to reveal these abuses and try to show the Administration that children and youth exist and are suffering.  Anxious to get the message out, Loiry published his own book on the politics of youth.  But while his effort was well-in-tentioned, <i>The Impact of Youth</i> remains too broad and simplistic to become a galvanizing force for change.</span></p> <p><span>Loiry's book, aimed at \"altering the future history by explaining the past,\" fails because it attempts too much.  The author tries to chronicle the complete history of children and youth from the times of ancient civilizations.  In 200 pages he travels through time from Mesopotamia and Sparta through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the twentieth century.  In the remaining 40 pages, he finally attacks the problems of today, and tries to set up comprehensive guidelines for the future.  This rush through the \"rise and fall\" of children ultimately undermines his own cause, Loiry, a professional political activist, has apparently not yet learned how to channel his abundant energy.</span></p> <p><span>The author is torn between writing a history, a policy paper and a manifesto--and each section suffers be cause of his confusion.  His history of children and youth is filled with amazing generalizations and couched in infantile language.  With sentences like \"children were an important part of what was happening in the American colonies,\" and \"'make love, not war' was a popular '60s slogan, and many people did,\" Loiry sabotages his own credibility as a serious scholar.  He seems unable to determine what audience he is speaking to.</span></p> <p><span>The last section of the book, Loiry's 33 \"Recommendations for the Future,\" suffers from similar problems.  Many are nebulous and naive wishes, with no specific suggestions:  he urges that \"a new concept of children and youth must be developed,' \"policy-making should focus on causes, and be based on the best research and data available,\" and \"an interdependence between generations must be strengthened.\"</span></p> <p><span>A few of the recommendations, to Loiry's credit, do manage to transcend this level.  He suggests possible ways to strengthen youth advocacy groups to provide a voice for children, such as reforming IRS Tax Exemption laws to enable groups to spend more time and funds on legislative activities.  He lobbies for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54's proposed 2.5 billion food stamp and child nutrition program; and he urges the United States to stay in UNESCO, an international organization which provides massive food, educational, and development aid to underdeveloped countries to \"assist the world's children.\"</span></p> <p><span>Loiry is currently stumping with the Democratic candidates, trying to win commitments for youth issues.  But for all his efforts, no candidates have focused on the needs of children and young adults beyound vague references to America's \"future\" and \"sacred trust\" for coming generations.</span></p> <p><span>The apparent failure of both Loiry and his book to catch fire is all the more disappointing because the issue is a real one.  The facts they list speak for themselves; millions of American children are either hungry or malnourished; over one million suffer forms of child abuse each year; and over 22 million, more than 20 percent of the nation's children live in poverty.  Unless these abuses are corrected, and quickly, the next generation will grow up in despair.</span></p>"}

Mounded by corporate thugs for six months, the company finally gave in two weeks ago--for $13.2 billion.  In a desperate, last-ditch effort to avoid the clutches of Texas buyout cannibal T. Boone Pickens, executives of Gulf--the seventh largest oil concern in the country--sold out to Standard Oil of California, the eight largest.</span></p> <p><span>Pickens's assault on Gulf was both brutal and spooky.  Pickens, the head of the Mesa Petroleum Company, a small but pesky outfit, has through a series of obnoxious buyout threats acquired a terrible reputation in the industry.  The history of his Viet Cong-style hit-and-run attacks on corporations far bigger than Mesa goes back to 1982.</span></p> <p><span>Originally, Pickens embroiled himself in a tug-of-war with the late Citgo in the summer of 1982.  In trying to take over Citgo, Pickens found Citgo returning the assault with its own takeover bid for Mesa.</span></p> <p><span>Ironically, that time it was Gulf that stepped in as Pickens's savior when it looked like Mesa might just lose.  Gulf offered to buy Citgo, freeing Mesa, then declined to do so.  Citgo eventually went to Occidental Petroleum.</span></p> <p><span>By reselling its stock to Occidental, Mesa made a painless $12.5 million for simply hiring an army of bankers and lawyers to scare Citgo, and Pickens was excited about the possibilities.  Two more unsuccessful but lucrative takeover bids by Mesa followed, and in August of 1983, having received his baptism in fire, was ready for the big time.</span></p> <p><span>Pickens teamed up with several partners and began buying up Gulf shares when they were worth $39.  By October 14, Pickens owned about 9 percent of Gulf, and he tried to squeeze himself into Gulf's management to make it easier to buy more.</span></p> <p><span>Gulf officials, fearing Pickens as much as they detested him, moved to keep the oil bandit out by rechartering their company as a Delaware corporation rather than a Pennsylvania one, relying on technical obstacles to Pickens's bid to gain control.</span></p> <p><span>Pickens and Gulf battled for control through proxies with the stockholders, and when Pickens lost in December, Gulf foolishly figured it had won.  Pickens would have had somehow to convince half of Gulf's stockholders to choose him as a director, and the company doubted he would be able to with his small portion of the outstanding stock.  They relaxed.</span></p> <p><span>At the same time, however, Texaco was waging its own frontal assault on Getty.  In early February number-six Texaco beat number-nine Getty, having come up with $12 billion to buy out the smaller cousin--setting a new record for the biggest corporate takeover.</span></p> <p><span>The willingness of bankers to arrange the huge Texaco loan brought a new company into the Pickens vs. Gulf fight.  Atlantic Richfield, moving to increase its oil reserves, offered Gulf $70 a share in mid-February.</span></p> <p><span>Gulf headily rejected the bid, figuring it could get more on the market once it carried through its plans to dump its Canadian subsidiary and reorganize its refining and marketing.</span></p> <p><span>But Pickens heard about the rebuffed Arco bid, and sold $300 million of securities to come up with the cash for a $65/share bid for about 12 percent of Gulf's shares, to add to the 9 percent of the company he already controlled.</span></p> <p><span>Gulf was scared, so scared that, to fend off Pickens, it went public on February 24.  As the oil world shook itself out, three buyers emerged by the March 14 purchase deadline--Arco at $72, Socal at $80, and an extremely complicated offer worked out by some Gulf executives with the help of a financial house which specializes in this kind of corporate jihad.  Although the in-house offer would have reaped the most--$87 per share with plans to spin off the least profitable branches of the company to increase its overall attractiveness--it was too complex to be digested and worked out by the March 14 deadline.  And so Gulf went to Socal, the high bidder.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>DMITTEDLY, this is a very convoluted and shady tale.  But it reveals just how President Carter's 1979 wild deregulation and the Reagan Administration's flaccid anti-trust prosecution efforts have combined to produce exactly what both Administrations said they would not--vicious interboardroom wars instead of increased oil exploration.</span></p> <p><span>In the three years after Carter deregulated the industry, exploration and production have increased 115 percent and earnings have zoomed 147 percent.  But mergers and acquisitions--the majority of which have been extremely unfriendly--have exploded 600 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Part of the reason for the unbridled growth in what might be called the takeover industry has been attributed to oil companies choosing the easy way out.  Instead of exploring for oil and gas they capture another company, along with its ever more lucrative reserves.  In buying Gulf, for instance, Socal spent $13.2 billion but got $15.4 billion worth of reserves after discounting for the cost of buying the company.  Texaco got $10.4 billion in reserves when it snatched Getty.</span></p> <p><span>Quite simply, all the easy oil has already been pumped.  Exploration costs per barrel now stand at about $15--which leaves little room for profit on a barrel of oil commanding a $29 world price.  Last year the 20 largest oil companies in the U.S. found only 60 percent as much petroleum as they refined.</span></p> <p><span>But more fundamentally, corporate takeovers are fabulously worthwhile.  Pickens made $760 million profit in his \"unsuccessful\" effort to buy Gulf, and Gulf's stockholders ended up with an additional $5.3 billion.</span></p> <p><span>Although Congress has just recently woken up to the danger of the oil takeovers--not to mention similar horror stories in the steel and railroad industries--nobody has done anything to stop them.  The 1961 Reagan tax cuts for corporations gave them the fuel for their orgiastic frenzy of violent buyouts:  the impotence of his attorney general in stopping them has acted as encouragement.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan would do well to open his eyes to what these buyouts mean for his rosy economic plans.  While his huge budget deficit is the most obvious culprit in tightening up the loan market, $12 billion and $13 billion loans to oil companies to engage in utterly unproductive takeovers further restrict available credit with nothing to show afterward except inflated (or bruised) corporate egos and wealthy lawyers.  (Socal's bankers and attorneys walked off with $60 million when the dust settled.)</span></p> <p><span>In addition, when the Texaco-Getty and Socal-Gulf deals go through--Reagan's Justice Department is unlikely to require more than that they unload some of their departments to make the companies seem less, huge--fully 57 percent of the nation's oil reserves will be controlled by just eight companies, and their hold on refining and distributing will be strengthened.</span></p> <p><span>It would, indeed, be very surprising if Reagan's Justice Department requires more than token adjustments in the new $50 billion Socal-gulf company.  Reagan can claim no significant anti-trust prosecutions during his tenure--despite the mergers that have resulted in 30,000-mile railroad giants like Norfolk Southern and Southern Pacific-Santa Fe, and the recent rumblings in the steel industry where U.S. Steel, Republic Steel and LTV Corporation, three of the five biggest steel companies in the country, are planning mergers and acquisitions.</span></p> <p><span>Deregulation should not mean encouragement for corporate moguls to attack each other in heady games involving billions of dollars' worth of the nation's potential seed money.  The anti-trust legislation is already in place to fight back against the clustering of wealth and power in a small group of oilmen and profiteering kamikazes--and it must be used.</span></p>"}

Just ask President Reagan, whose current push for a Constitutional amendment permitting officially sanctioned prayer in public schools is particularly disgraceful.</span></p> <p><span>Thankfully, the Senate Tuesday rejected the proposed amendment by a margin of 11--with moderate Republicans tipping the balance.  School and prayer are, quite simply, an unacceptable fusion of church and state, as the Senate correctly resolved once again.  But the closeness of the vote and the determination of those supporting the measure warrant a close look at the politics of school prayer.</span></p> <p><span>Voters will recall that the question of voluntary prayer was a major part of Reagan's platform in 1980, but has--thank God--been noticeably dormant ever since.  But with the election year revving up into full gear, Reagan and his cohorts recently resuscitated the issue.  This turn of events throws considerable doubt on the Reaganites' claims that all they are trying to do is to welcome the God \"who loves us\" back into the classroom.  Rather, it suggests tht Reagan wants to shore up support among New Right groups in the South and Roman Catholics in the North, as some of his more honest aides have admitted.</span></p> <p><span>What makes the whole affair downright unseemly is that Reagan himself has admitted to attending church about four times during his Oval Office stay, an odd figure for someone who so passionately trumpets the cause of God on his political battlefields.</span></p> <p><span>More important, though, voters should be watchful of the apparent willingness of Reagan and some Congressmen to sell their political souls to religious lobbies; with school prayer on hold, at least for the moment, these politicians may well be seeking to wave the banner of God in some other sector of official life.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Indian Resiliency | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N THE LATE 1960s, when Washington was still showing a degree of concern for the poor, the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) hired me to help investigate housing conditions on the Rosebud Sioux reservation in South Dakota.  With a team of self-confessed experts I visited all 22 villages, from Two Strike to Milk's Camp, and discovered, among other this, that families there had much to endure.  Many occupied dirt floor huts bereft of adequate heat and running water; some were forced to sleep, even to cook, in rusted-out car bodies.  The families were virtually defenseless against the frequent blizzards that swept the South Dakota prairie.</span></p> <p><span>Our architectural consultant, a cheerful young provincial from Chillicothe, Ohio, went from door to door asking astonished Sioux mothers whether they--preferred gas stoves to electric stoves; whether they liked bunk-beds; whether the children could use a \"mud room\" for their boots and galoshes.  The poor fellow seldom received an answer.</span></p> <p><span>At the time I attributed the mothers' reticence to the fact that their houses had no electricity, their rooms had no beds and their children had no boots.  But there may have been another explanation.  As a tribal leader admonished us, \"You should not ask so many questions.  The people think that there is a right answer and a wrong answer, and if they give the wrong answer, they will not get a new house.\"  Over the centuries we have admired Indian silence as the complement of Indian eloquence.  But the silence may also have been a way of staying out of trouble, of finessing a conqueror's catechisms.</span></p> <p><span>Two of the people I met during that chastening sojourn at Rosebud were Nancy and Sam White Horse, who lived in an unpainted shack atop a wintery knoll near the town of Mission.  Born around the turn-of-the-century, they had spent most of their lives on the reservation, taking strong roles in tribal affairs and sharing with other members of the tribe in the manifold miseries as well as the sporadic improvements that came their way:  the new schools, the modernized health facilities and the paved roads that were occasionally vouchsafed to the Sioux of Rosebud.</span></p> <p><span>Now the arrival of \"Washington officials\" gave grounds for hope that housing might be the next item slated for progress.  \"Our children need warm houses that can be lit with the electric,\" said Nancy White Horse, who already had many grandchildren of her own.  Then, as we stood amid the tall yellow grass by her road, she made me a promise.  \"You're not the first to fly out here and look around,\" she informed me with a patient smile.  \"Nothing ever comes of it, but I'll tell you what:  if you can get some houses built for my people, I'll make you a quilt.\"</span></p> <p><span>In time, the OEO built 400 houses on the Rosebud reservation--and Nancy White Horse was as good as her word.  The quilt she sent was a brilliant patchwork of red, orange and white, with a large green star at the center.  Diane and I still have it, buy we do not sleep beneath it:  the artwork seems to delicate, the colors too fresh, to stand nightly wear and tear.  Besides, our house has central heating.</span></p> <p><span>It was hardly surprising that the bargain Nancy White Horse struck with me would benefit the whole tribe--\"I you can get some houses built for my people--rather than herself alone.  In Indian country people tend to move forward in concert.  Their individual struggles become a war of all on behalf of all.  Nor was it unusual that out of the tatters of her daily life she should fashion for me a gift of great beauty.  That, too, went with the teritory.  In a culture with few commodoties and virtually no market, generosity can florish.</span></p> <p><span>The second worst thing that can happen to a people is to be conquered.  The worst is to live through the ordeal that follows:  to submit.  The suicides, the alcoholism, the mists of despair that today envelop many reservations all seem legacies of a colonial past that won't go away.  \"Winter in the blood\" is the way James Welch, the Montana Blackfeet novelist, describes the consequences--a freezing up of the Indian psyche in the face of daily deprivations of the spirit.  \"I was,\" he writes, \"as distant from myself as the hawk from the moon.\"</span></p> <p><span>The policies that chilled rosebud are not difficult to trace, though in the beginning, as the U.S. Supreme Court later noted, Congress showed \"the most anxious desire to conciliate the Indian nations.\"  The famous Northwest Ordinance, which the first Congress ratified in 1789, stipulated that \"The utmost good faith shall always be observed towards Indians; their land and property shall never be taken from them without their consent.\"  But with the ascendance of Andrew Jackson the federal government abandoned all pretense of concern for Indian rights.  In place of conciliation Jackson and his successors pursued a policy of removal and relocation, forcibly transfering eastern tribes to territories in the west.  There followed a dismal procession of measures designed to wipe out tribal sovereignty and assimilate Indians into the white-American mainstream.  In mid-century Congress established federal boarding schools for Indian children, where they were forbidden to speak their parents' language on pain of corporal punishment; in 1871 it abolished the practice of making treaties with Indian tribes; and in 1887 it passed the notorious General Allotment Act, which divided communally held tribal lands into separate, individually held parcels.  The purpose was to break up the tribes' land base and turn Indians into farmers.</span></p> <p><span>By the time the allotment system was repealed in 1934, tribal land holdings had dropped from 140 million acres to 50 million acres.  John Collier, the New Deal Commissioners of Indian Affairs, did more than merely stop the hemorrhaging.  Through the Indian Reorganization Act he coaxed from America a commitment \"to rehabilitate the Indian's economic life and to give him a chance to develop initiative destroyed by a century of oppression and determinism.\"</span></p> <p><span>If succeeding generations have blurred Collier's generous vision, we have nevertheless held fast to his dream of tribal integrity.  Richard Nixon endorsed it in 1970, and Congress reaffirmed it five years later with passage of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act.  Even Ronald Reagan has pledged \"to encourage and strengthen tribal government\" and \"to deal with Indian tribes on a government-to-government basis.\"</span></p> <p><span>In dealing with Indians, however, this Administration remains true to its own peculiar vision of justice.  It is using \"self-determination\" as a euphemism for self-sacrifice, shutting off tribal assistance while lecturing tribes on the virtues of standing tall.  Last years Indian assistance funds were cut by more than-one-third, including a 44 percent reduction in job programs.  Naturally, unemployment on the reservations jumped from 30 percent to over 50 percent.  Reaganomics, it appears, means subsidy for the affluent and self-determination for the poor.  We have invented an entirely new breed of fortunate victims:  the starving free.</span></p> <p><span>Still, the tribes persist--283 of them at last count--and it can be said that in some respects they thrive.  At the turn-of-the-century the U.S. Indian population was under 300,000; today it is 1.4 million and climbing.  Do the tribes know some thing we don't?  Do they have something to teach Mr. Reagan--not, to be sure, about getting ahead in the world, but perhaps about<i>not</i> getting ahead? Is it possible that life is more fruitfully lived in the Indians' circular way (the turning of the earth) than in our accustomed linear fashion (onward and upward)?</span></p> <p><span>A few weeks ago I returned to Rosebud for the first time in a dozen years.  It took me awhile to find Nancy White Horse because she had moved to a new neighborhood, a place named in honor of her husband who had died a few years ago:  The Sam White Horse Housing Project.</span></p> <p><span>Nancy's face bore more wrinkles than I'd remembered, and she walked very carefully now, but otherwise she seemed unchanged, and certainly undiscouraged.</span></p> <p><span>\"What happened to your other house?\"  I asked \"The one we built for you.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Oh,\" she said, \"there was a fellow who needed a place to live.  So I gave him the house.\"</span></p> <p><span>I thought of John Wesley, that troubled missionary who learned something in the 18th Century that we have forgotten in the 20th.  Homeward bound to England, Wesley gazed out at a tossing sea and wrote in his diary, \"I came to America to convert the Indians.  But oh, dear God, who will convert me?\"</span></p> <p><span><i>Richard J. Margolis, a writer, is a Fellow this year at the Institute of Politics, Kennedy School of Government.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "The Once Great Society | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>N</b>ot SURPRISINGLY given my history, urban issues, particularly New York City issues, have consumed my life.  At some level I realized that mine might be a somewhat specialized preoccupation--the result of my growing up in a New York political family, of my exposure to the currents--and the urban riots--of the 1960s, of the provincialism a New Yorker can have about his city's problems.</span></p> <p><span>But what has struck me during my first five weeks back in Cambridge--the first time I've had to put what I have been doing for the past 10 years in perspective--is how little my personal preoccupation with cities is shared--by presidential candidates, by professors, and by public opinion.  In the 1960s and early 1970s the fate of cities was a dominant, if not the dominant, issue of domestic concern.  Books after book appeared on city politics, city problems, city architecture, city history.  Here at Harvard two of the most popular undergraduate government courses dealt with urban issues.</span></p> <p><span>Today the situation is very different.  To be kind, one can say that President Reagan has not made urban needs a priority, and the Democratic candidates have hardly made this failure an issue in the campaign.  With the exception of an occasional Brookings Institution report, Robert Caro's biography of Robert Moses, and a few accounts of the New York City fiscal crisis, no significant books on urban issues have appeared in the last 10 years.  From what I can tell about Harvard, courses on Urban issues are confined to an occasional graduate seminar.</span></p> <p><span>Now I suppose it could be said that all this is good for me personally, that it will force me to recognizer there is life beyond negotiating with the City Council and balancing budgets.  But clearly it is not good for cities, and, I would argue, it is not good for national policy.  America's longterm future, or even interesting political science.</span></p> <p><span>In 1931 Walter Lippman wrote.  \"The true view of cities is to regard them as places where the activities of the whole nation come to a head...There is no way to separate the cities from the nation.\"  Seven years later Lewis Mumford observed that \"today we begin to see that the improvement of cities is not matter for small one sided reforms; the task of city design involves the vaster task of rebuilding our civilization.\"  Both statements have at least equal, if not greater, meaning today.</span></p> <p><span>America's central cities, which contain close to 30 percent of all households with incomes under $7000 a year, present the sharpest picture of the continuing persistence of poverty in this country.  With close to 60 percent of Black families and over half of all Hispanic families, they pose the greatest challenge in terms of achieving racial equality and opportunity.  More than any other part of America, cities raise fundamental questions for this country's future:  Whether America's increasingly service-oriented economy can absorb low-killed workers; whether this society can deal with welfare dependency and the growth of an under class; whether there is a will and a capacity to rebuild a decaying infrastructure; whether government policies can effectively shape market forces to improve the environment.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed most of the issues receiving current national attention--the state of education, the difficulty of making the transition from a smokestack economy to the world of computer chips and microprocesors, homelessness in the midst of economic recovery--come to head most starkly, most compellingly in cities.  Cities in the 1980s, as in the 1930s, present many of the most basic--and most interesting issues--facing this country, issues which test our capacity to deal with social and economic change.</span></p> <p><span>No doubt some of the loss of interest in cities can be explained by America's constant desire to discover new issues.  This year's seems to be the search for an industrial policy.  Part also relates to the declining political importance of cities.  By 1970 more people lived in suburbs than in central cities, and that pattern has continued over the last decade.  This shift in population, which is magnified when voter participation in considered, has made it harder for mayors to argue their case in Washington or state capitals.  A set of internal political changes have reinforced this overall loss of political power, particularly the decline of the machine and the increasing polarization of city politics one the basis of race and class.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, visible downtown commercial development (Renaissance Center in Detroit, Faneuil Hall and now Copley Place in Boston, Peach tree Center in Atlanta, South Street Seaport and Battery Park City in New York) have created the illusion that urban decline is abating.  The degree of attention devoted to the so-called issue of gentrification--the displacement of poor residents by young professionals--has added to this impression.</span></p> <p><span>But more than anything else, a sense of frustration over the failures of past programs has shifted the concern of policy-makers and policy-shapers away to other issues.  Somehow urban problems, at least as they were described by the rhetoric of the 1960s, have intractable or at best only marginally susceptible to solution.  Housing initiatives--from public housing to urban renewal to \"model cities\" to \"section 8\" to housing allowances--have not significantly reversed urban decline, much less brought residents back to devastated areas like the South Bronx.  New concepts of urban design, many pioneered at Harvard and MIT, have produced some better buildings but have not transformed the urban environment.  Poverty programs, whether those from War on Poverty days, or more recent efforts such as the supported work program, have not reversed a growing pattern of dependency.  The list could go on Leave aside the obvious questions of whether the American public ever had the patience to give some of these policies a real chance or whether they were funded to the extent required or whether other Federal programs such as highway construction and tax benefits for homeowners undercut their effectiveness.  The truth is that none worked the magic its advocates had predicted.  In some cases (urban renewal, for example) more harm than good may have been achieved.  In others management proved a real problem.  In still others, well-publicized abuses particularly rip--offs of poverty and housing programs, damaged the programs credibility.  In others the unintended consequences of well-intended initiatives produced new problems.</span></p> <p><span>No question about it much of the frustration is justified.  Urban problems, as I can attest from my 10 years in New York City's government, are persistent and can be wearing.  But much of the frustration also flows from other sources, especially a naivete about human nature and politics on the part of those who discovered the \"urban crisis\" in the 1960s.  This country should be learning from past mistakes instead of ignoring them; learning that community involvement does not necessarily mean community improvement, instead of forgetting about communities, learning that dollars directed at a problem do not necessrily solve it instead of pretending the problem does not exist.</span></p> <p><span>The reality is cities will remain.  They can get worse, and hopefully they can get better.  Anyway, for whatever it's worth, I am with Lippman and Mumford in believing that what happens to them will both reflect and determine what happens to America.  And perhaps someday soon Harvard and the country will be with them too.</span></p> <p><span><i>Robert F.

They do not lead settled lives but are constantly involved in the law in its most intrusive forms they go to government officials for many of the things others get privately; they get evicted; they have their furniture repossessed; they can't pay their utility bills.</span></p> <p><span>Were it not for the combined efforts of legal services agencies, law school legal and programs, and volunteers in the private bar, many of these people would have no access to legal services and consequently no opportunity to redress their wrongs through the legal system.  The Reagan Administration--in its cut-and-gut approach to public assistance programs--has cut back funding for legal services.  These cutbacks are already having drastic effects on legal services, and will have drastic effects on the poor community.</span></p> <p><span>Until the early 1960s, the only form of legal assistance available to the poor was provided through an informal network of private legal aid societies supported by charities or city funding, and on occasion by the vounteer efforts of private lawyers.  Then in 1962, Lyndon Johnson launched the \"War on Poverty,\" which created a federal Legal Services Program under the auspices of the Office for Economic Opportunity (OEO).  Over the next decade, however, that program fell out of the Administration's good grace:  Vice President Spiro Agnew labelled its lawyers \"ideological vigilantes, and many officials in the federal government saw the program as a prime example of the \"War on Poverty's\" misplaced energies.</span></p> <p><span>The private bar and other supporters of the program began a combined effort in the early '70s to extricate legal services from the politics of the OEO and lodge it in a separate non-profit corporation which could administer congressionally appropriated funds.  In 1974 the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) opened shop.</span></p> <p><span>Legal services flourished under the LSC for nearly a decade.  By 1980, the Corporation's budget had reached $321 million; and in 1979 it closed more than one million cases.  But it now appears that even the LSC has been unable to extricate legal services from the politics of federal government.  The Reagan Administration has tried repeatedly, without success, to persuade Congress to cut off funds for the Corporation.  In 1981, Congress agreed to reduce the program's annual budget to $241 million, where it has remained despite the increasing demand for legal assistance.</span></p> <p><span>According to a nationwide survey of the LSC's field offices, these budget cuts have seriously diminished the legal resources available to the poor community.  By 1983 the number of lawyers in LSC offices had already decreased by 30 percent, with many programs losing their most experienced lawyers; the number of paralegals also decreased by 25 percent, while the number of poor people eligible for assistance increased by 15 percent.  Virtually all of the offices surveyed were turning away eligible clients because of large caseloads.  In addition, other clients were being put on long waiting lists and may never receive help.</span></p> <p><span>Greater Boston Legal Services (GBLS), the local chapter of the Legal Services Corporation, has felt the full effect of the Reagan cuts.  Funded by Congress through LSC, by United Way and by local law firms, GBLS provides free legal assistance in cases that involve domestic relations, consumer law, landlord/tenant disputes, and government benefits.  According to Sally Dunnan, director of personal, GBLS's budget has been slashed by 25 percent.  As a result, it has had to reduce its staff by nearly one half.</span></p> <p><span>\"We have been losing some really good attorneys and support staff,\" says Harvey Shapiro, a GBLS staff lawyer.  Although the program receives financial support from private sources, that support has not been able to make up for the losses in federal funding.  \"They have certainly stepped up efforts to obtain private funding, but that hasn't eliminated the need to cut back,\" according to Carol Wagan, a staff lawyer at the Legal Advocacy and Resource Center who works closely with GBLS.</span></p> <p><span><b>J</b>UST AS resources have diminished, so too has morale among both clients and lawyers.  \"If you want to describe Legal Services now,\" adds Shapiro, \"It's tremendous morale problems.\"  Some clients are angry because their cases are simply not being handled.  \"It's not like you can call them up and talk to a lawyer,\" says a woman from East Boston.  \"You've got to wait for an appointment and by the time you get one it's probably too late.  They just don't have the time\" Staff lawyers, on the other hand, feel as if they are working in a \"sustained bunker atmosphere.\"  For while the demand for their services increases daily, so does the general feeling of uncertainty concerning the program's future.  As Wagan says, \"The morale problems come from the sense that there is less security in Legal Services.\"</span></p> <p><span>Funding cutbacks have resulted in the development of new programs in order to increase the poor community's access to legal services The Legal Advocacy and Resource Center (LARC), a privately funded organization which provides legal information and referrals to low income groups in the Boston area, was conceived as a direct response to the cutbacks According to Wagan, the Massachusetts Legal Reform Institute conducted a study on ways in which legal services could be improved in the city.  \"One of the things they decided was that there should be an agency that could provide information about the various resources available in the area.  It was based on the idea that we could use volunteers as a way to help make up for the diminishing resources.\"</span></p> <p><span>The role of the private bar has also increased as a result of the funding cutbacks, with many programs recruiting more lawyers in private practice to take on cases for free.  In 1977 there were only a handful of such programs across the country; now there are over a 150.  Critics of the Legal Services Corporation have said that most poverty law work could be done free or at reduced rate by the private bar.  But LSC program directors report that less than half the clients they turn away are able to get help from attorneys in private practice.</span></p> <p><span>Vicki Young, a member of the Volunteer Lawyers Project, agrees.  \"There was a report issued in Washington on Legal Services--I think David Stockman wrote it--and basically what he said was, 'Well, gee, don't you think we can let the bar take care of the problem and get rid of all these expensive legal services programs?  Of course that's blatantly impossible.  Even if the bar could handle the demand, who would link up the indigent community and the lawyers?  Besides, most of the lawyers in private practice don't have the expertise necessary to handle the legal problems which poor people have.  That's why we're here:  we lawyers to deal with these problems.</span></p> <p><span>While many at LARC and VLP feel that volunteer efforts in legal services have been successful, they nevertheless agree that the federal government must commit itself to the support of legal assistance programs if the poor community is to receive the services it needs.  \"Legal Services can't do it alone, and neither can the private bar,\" says Young.  \"There's get to be an organized system where the programs and the bar can work together.\"</span></p> <p><span>If that system is going to work, the Administration will have to show the kind of commitment already shown by legal services workers.  \"Why should I go to law school?  asks a LARC staff member.  \"It would cost me a bundle in student loans, and then I'd just have to go work for some corporate law firm to pay them back.  It would be like selling my soul.  And I'd rather stay right here.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Keeping Secrets | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>My attention has just been called to your issue of January 12, 1984, with an article by Dr. Sissela Bok, \"Securing Information.\"  Of the Reagan administration's efforts to amend the Freedom of Information Act and to restrict access to information in other ways, Dr. Bok says:</span></p> <p><span>If we consider other societies that labor under official control over what is written, over research, over travel and public service, we find that the control affects not only what is dangerous to national security but, much more often, what would present a challenge to government leaders themselves:  all that might prove embarassing, all that stands in need of challenge, all that exposes failure and abuses...</span></p> <p><span>Dr Bok feels that \"there is no greater danger for free democratic systems than the pressure to imitate the security measures of modern police states.\"</span></p> <p><span>Readers of Dr. Bok's article would never know that Harvard University pursues the policy of secrecy that she deplores in others.  I agree with her that \"the press has done surprisingly little\" to discuss the issue of secrecy.  I write this article in the belief that The Crimson, also agreeing with Dr Bok, will take this opportunity to inform its readers about secrecy at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>In December 1977, through the courtesy of Dean of the Faculty Henry Rosovsky.  I received a copy of the letter President Bok sent to those who had requested permission to do research in the Corporation records (i.e. the records of the University) dealing with events during the McCarthy period President Bok repeated whatHarvardGeneral Counsel Daniel Steiner '54 had already announced.  The rule closing Corporation documents to the public for fifty years would not be set aside, no one was suffering a serious injustice or current damage because of confusion over past events and, besides, preservation that only the passage of time can bring.</span></p> <p><span>I did nothing about the letter until I was reminded of a passage in it by the coincidence of two events in April 1980.  On April 11, I read a paper at the annual meeting of the Organization of American Historians on my research, made possible through the Freedom of Information Act, on the relations between the FBI and universities and labor unions during the McCarthy period.  Among the documents I had received were reports from the Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the Boston FBI office to Washington headquarters dealing with the \"most cooperative and understanding association between the Bureau and Harvard University\" and with the \"arrangements [that] have been perfected whereby information of interest will be made available to the Bureau on a confidential basis\" (SAC Boston to The Director.  FBI, June 19, July 31, 1950).  I read in the newspapers the very next day that President Bok had written in an open letter to the Harvard faculty concerning the controversy over an appointment to Professor Arnold Harberger, [to the Harvard Institute for International Development] that \"allowing political judgements to influence faculty appointments is a threat to the fundamental principles of academic freedom,\" and had drawn \"a parallel between the protests lodged against Harberger and the climate created in the early 1950s by Joseph McCarthy...\"</span></p> <p><span>The FBI documents I had received seemed possibly to clarify an obscure passage in President Bok's earlier letter to those who sought access to the Harvard documents.  It is quite possible, he wrote then, that the Harvard files contain records relating to the political activities of various people, based on information submitted by individuals or noted down by administrative officials after conversations Just why Harvard officials should have noted such political information was not discussed by President Bok, but the FBI documents provided one possible explanation--an \"arrangement\" existed with the FBI President Bok's warning in his open letter about the danger of \"political considerations\" in the making of appointments and his explicit reference to the damage McCarthy had done seemed to justify the hope that perhaps a change in policy was possible.  On April 24, 1980.  I wrote to President Bok congratulating him on the stand he had taken.  I expressed the hope that this position, together with the forcefulness of arguments that had recently been made against lying and concealment, would lead him to reconsider the 50-year rule.</span></p> <p><span>President Bok's reply complimented me on my ingenuity in suggesting that concealment of the truth, in the form of denying access to historical documents, is sufficiently close to lying as to raise serious moral questions.  He maintained, however, that the conduct of university business required respect for the commitment to confidentiality made at earlier times.  As for the present, confidentiality was required if people were not to be afraid to disclose sensitive facts.  He concluded by suggesting that if, someday, his wife were to write a book on the ethics of secrecy as a companion to her book on lying, he and I would be able to discuss the matter with greater sophistication.</span></p> <p><span>In my reply to President Bok I pointed out that the distinction he made between lying and failing to disclose did not fully dispose of the matter.  Witnesses in a court of law are put under oath not only not to lie, but to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth President Bok's position.  I felt, made it clear that he would disapprove of a Harvard official's lying about the university's relations with the FBI during the McCarthy period, but he would not disapprove of the refusal of a Harvard official to reveal what he knew about those relations or make available the documents that would permit others to construct the record of history.  As to the argument that the university must respect earlier committments to confidentiality.  I asked if in fact that university had made such commitments and to whom--to its own employees (all of them or some of them), to government officials?  As to his argument that the principle of confidentiality must be maintained lest people refuse to reveal sensitive facts and opinions.  I pointed out that the FBI was not interested in \"facts and opinions in general, nor facts and opinions about Good and Evil in Western Literature, Change and Continuity in History, Citizenship and Its Obligations in Classical Antiquity,\" but facts and opinions about the political beliefs of particular people, \"exactly the kinds of beliefs and opinions which you warned against taking into account in the making of academic appointments.\"  President Bok's position would make it impossible to examine the Harvard documents in an effort to determine the degree to which its officials shared the FBI's concern with sensitive facts and opinions and cooperated in enquiring into them.</span></p> <p><span>I argued, too, that my request for access to certain documents would not involve a breach of confidentiality.  I was interested only in those documents dealing with Harvard's relations with the FBI, and those could be made available in a form which allowed inferences to be drawn as to policy without revealing the names of informants, either those that Harvard used internally or those who reported for Harvard to the FBI.  What President Bok presented as an argument based on confidentiality was in reality.  I said, a claim to immunity based on executive privilege.  Those who had formulated a particular policy were to be protected from the consequences of their decisions by making it impossible to inquire into what they had done and why.  \"There is an ethical argument to be made in support of the principle of confidentiality, and I have not asked you to breach confidentiality.  But there is no ethical argument to be made in support of the principle of executive privilege, only a political argument.\"</span></p> <p><span>I concluded by reminding President Bok that he had not commented on the two FBI documents concerning Harvard that I had sent him, and by pointing out that his arguments were rejected at the time the Freedom of Information Act had been debated--and that neither the government nor the sky had fallen.</span></p> <p><span>President Bok did not reply, and I wrote to him on July 29, 1980, asking permission to quote from our correspondence in connection with some articles I was writing.</span></p> <p><span>To that letter President Bok did reply.  He was at a great disadvantage in carrying on a debate with me because of the enormous demands of operating the university, including the capital fund campaign.  Since he did not have time to engage in such a debate, which the importance of the issue would warrant, he did not believe he could authorize publication of the correspondence, which did not do full justice to his views.</span></p> <p><span>I wrote at once that I had not asked for a debate nor for permission to publish the correspondence, but only for permission to quote from it in some articles I was writing.  I wondered if his objection to reproduction of his letters included objection to quotations from them.</span></p> <p><span>On September 9, 1980, President Bok wrote that this was a matter that he would either want to discuss in detail or say nothing about in print at all.  He chose the latter course as the only feasible one.  I could not quote from his letters.</span></p> <p><span>That ended my correspondence with President Bok, though not with Dr. Bok.  After the publication of her books on Lying and Secrecy and following the appearance of her article on the Op-Ed page of the New York Times on the dangers of secrecy.  I wrote to solicit her support--given her strongly felt views about these matters--in changing Harvard's secrecy policy.  Neither in her books nor in her many articles has Dr. Bok ever mentioned that policy.  I appreciate the reasons for her reticence, but since they do not apply to me and since I feel that the fight for freedom of information, like charity, begins at home.  I thought it would be helpful to call the matter to her attention.  If, now, Dr. Bok continues to keep silent about Harvard's secrecy policy, as, judging from her article in The Crimson, she does, it is not because she does not know of it but because she chooses not to speak of it.</span></p> <p><span>On March 16, 1983 just after her Op-Ed page article was printed.  I wrote Dr. Bok that even the FBI provided at least limited access to its documents under the Freedom of Information Act, but that Harvard barred all access to Corporation documents for a period of fifty years.  As a result, scholars interested in the relations between government and universities during the McCarthy period were severely handicapped.  I enclosed copy of a recent article I had written on Harvard and the FBI, quoting several FBI documents indicating the existence, as one of them put it, of \"a most cooperative and understanding association between the Bureau and Harvard University.\"  Efforts to discover the nature of that \"association\"--how it worked, with whom it was established, who was affected by it-- were frustrated by the FBI's censorship of the documents it released and Harvard's refusal to release any documents at all for fifty years, a policy more restrictive than the Official Secrets Acts of many governments.  I wrote Dr. Bok that those who petitioned Harvard for a relaxation of its policy were told by the administration that the passage of fifty years, by improving the perspective from which we view the events of the McCarthy period, will aid in maturing our judgment.</span></p> <p><span>I pointed out to Dr. Bok that I had corresponded with President Bok about Harvard's policy, and that he had refused me permission to quote from his letters.  And I concluded:</span></p> <p><span>The veil of secrecy is drawn so tight that not only is it impossible to reconstruct the events of the past, but even to reveal the existence of a debate about the meaning of those events....One does not expect...university presidents to adapt Orwell's memory hole\" to the governance of universities.</span></p> <p><span>When I had not heard from Dr. Bok after nearly two months.  I wrote her again:</span></p> <p><span>Your books on lying and secrecy have looked into some dark corners and therefore have been called \"consequentia.\"  I think you would disclose still more ambiguities if your third book were to deal with silence.  Merely to show the implications of some primitive distinctions would be helpful; for example, to distinguish between the silence that gives consent and the silence that is the product of the fear to dissent--or the silence that comes when one cannot find words with which to express the emotion of release from some oppressive affliction and the silence that makes one an accomplice to such oppression.</span></p> <p><span>Sometime later, in May, 1983, Dr. Bok telephoned me to say that she had not written because of the press of work at the end of the academic year.  She was interested in the letters and articles I had sent, she said, and I would soon hear from her at length, but I have not.</span></p> <p><span><i>Sigmund Diamond is Giddings Professor of Sociology and Professor of History, Columbia University.</i></span></p> <p><span>My concern is less with Dr. Bok's moral postures this with President Bok's administrative position.  I do not expect a resuscitation of my correspondence with them, but my correspondence with Harvard continues fitfully, and I can report to The Crimson that President Bok's policy on official secrecy continues.  In response to my request for access to archival materials at the Law School, Assistant Dean Stephen M. Bernard informed me that no waiver of the 50-year rule would be granted.  The reasons?  One,\"--the task of going through these materials to extract the ones relevant to your request was daunting and would involve my spending an amount of time on this project that I simply do not have.\"  Second,\"...you would probably be dissatisfied with the results of a process that involved my filtering out--on the basis of factors relating to the purposes of the 50-year rule, such as issues of individual privacy -- documents you might judge, if you had access to them, to be relevant to your inquiries.\"  Stone-walling at Watergate relied on the doctrine of executive privilege; at Massachusetts Hall it rests mainly on administrative convenience.</span></p> <p><span>In my time at Harvard, the Confidential Guide to courses was useful in providing countervailing information to official blurbs.  Perhaps the unofficial recital of events I have provided will help present and future Harvard students in making educational choices by providing a context for the Core Curriculum course.  \"Moral Choice and Personal Responsibility,\" officially described as dealing with:  \"The role of moral deliberation and choice in such personal conflicts as those having to do with loyalty, promises, secrecy, and truthfulness, and in weighing modes of conduct and life plans.\"  I hope it will be helpful to them, as I hope it will be helpful to those scholars who will not be deflected from the search for Veritas because they are seduced by currently fashionable cant that covers up unpalatable particular truths by parading its preference for lofty, but unexceptionable, general truths</span></p>"}

Next door neighbor?</span></p> <p><span>A random sample of the American population [or so we might hope] would probably reveal a fairly low number of affirmatives to these questions, a quick survey of Reagan appointees could turn up something else again.</span></p> <p><span>This time the name is Meese.  Nominated for the prestigious post of Attorney General, Edwin R. Meese III discovered he could only proceed down Pennsylvania Avenue to Justice after a laborious detour on Capitol Hill before the Senate Judiciary committee.  Meese's apparent involvement in or knowledge of the Reagan camp's acquisition of covert Carter campaign papers in 1980 promised, by itself, to be only a minor fly in the confirmation ointment.  But then came the money.</span></p> <p><span>It seems there was a questionable appointment here, a few cufflinks there.  Before long, Meese's financial dealings and subsequent patronage had sparked an investigative firestorm in Washington.  And last week, both Meese and his critics were calling for a special prosecutor to examine his conduct in office--the latter to savage his confirmation hopes, the former in hopes of clearing his name once and for all.</span></p> <p><span>In a February 8 editorial, \"Bring on the Veto,\" The Crimson called for the Senate to reject Meese's nomination, but noted, \"to his credit, Ed Meese's name has not been linked to the sort of sordid activity associated with colleagues like Ann Burford, James Watt, Paul Thayer, Rita Lavelle, Charles Wick or Ray Donovan.\"  But the charges brought against Meese during the recent hearigs clearly qualify him for a choice spot on that list, representing the standard bearers of what former Vice President Walter F. Mondale has aptly termed Reagan's \"sleaze factor.\"</span></p> <p><span>The accusations are as varied as the Administration officials charged with them:</span></p> <p><span>* Anne Burford, the former Environmental Protection Agency chief, was investigated for her preferential treatment of certain toxic waste producers:</span></p> <p><span>* Her former aide, Rita Lavelle, was convicted for perjury;</span></p> <p><span>* Former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Thayer and consultant to the National Security Council, Thomas Reed, quit their posts after allegations that they were involved with insider trading of stocks;</span></p> <p><span>* Former National Security Adviser Richard V. Allen resigned after accepting several wristwatches and $1000 for arranging an interview with Nancy Reagan for a Japanese magazine;</span></p> <p><span>* Former Veterans Administration official Robert Nimme resigned after he spent government money to redecorate his office:</span></p> <p><span>* Federal Aviation Administrator L. Lynn Helms was probed by a grand jury for past business dealings and then resigned;</span></p> <p><span>* CIA Director William Casey was charged with misleading investors about a company he worked with;</span></p> <p><span>The list goes on for more than 40 major and minor officials.</span></p> <p><span>The shape and color of the \"sleaze varies, but one thing has been remarkably consistent throughout the Administration's scandals--that is Reagan's steadfast support of his embattled appointees.  Loyalty is an admirable trait, but blind loyalty is not--especially in the Chief Executive.  Reagan's blanket support for Meese and others is egregious in placing personal loyalties above any regard for the integrity of federal law and the offices these appointees hold.</span></p> <p><span>As such, Reagan's conspicuous refusal to offer even a token public admonition against Administration misconduct is an insult to responsible government.  More important, it sheds a revealing light on the values of Reagan himself.  Asked about Meese's financial dealings, Reagan offered \"I do know that he had to make some pretty great economic sacrifices to come here and work for the government.\"</span></p> <p><span>The suggestion of the remark by the man who campaigned against Washington is ask not what you can do for government, but what your government can do for you.</span></p>"}

I feel compelled to point out that yesterday's National Labor Relations Board ruling demonstrates again just how wholeheartedly Harvard University has committed itself to union-busting and unfair labor practices.</span></p> <p><span>It should be obvious to all but the reactionary Reagan Board that Harvard consolidated personnel operations at the Medical Campus and Holyoke Center for the sole purpose of destroying the union organizing effort.  The University realized that the union did not have the resources to organize the Main Campus at the same time as the Medical Area, and that merely by shifting certain personnel operations of the Medical Area to Holyoke Center it could secure a Board ruling requiring a university-wide election, thus thwarting any successful organizing drive.</span></p> <p><span>This is not the only occasion on which Harvard has engaged in union-busting activities; rather, it is but one example of a comprehensive program to prevent workers from exercising their collective bargaining rights.  Harvard retains management consultants who specialize in union-busting.  Harvard has threatened to discharge workers who distribute union literature during office-wide coffee breaks.  The University's private police force even threatened to arrest pickets during this summer's food service worker's strike.</span></p> <p><span>Sometimes this program is defended by the paternalistic belief, articulated recently in The Crimson by General Counsel Daniel Steiner, that there is \"no particular advantage to...the people who work here by having a union represent staff at Harvard.  Union-busting has also been justified on grounds of economic necessity:  Harvard counsel Ed Powers said in the April 7, 1983. <i>Independent</i> as saying \"I'm not saying that (the food service workers) have a good life.  I could not raise a family on what they're making.  But you have to question priorities.\"</span></p> <p><span>Whether Harvard's union-busting tactics are based on misguided paternalism or outright contempt for workers' fights, it is high time that students in this University take a stand and object to use of their tuition dollars to subsidize the University's unfair labor practices. <b>Michael Dinnerstein</b> \u00a0\u00a0<b>Harvard College '82</b> \u00a0\u00a0<b>Harvard Clerical Worker '82-'83</b> \u00a0\u00a0<b>Harvard Law School '86</b></span></p>"}
{"title": "Too Many Vietnams | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>L</b>IKE the proverbial hardliner who finds communists beneath his bed, Senator Gary Hart sees a Vietnam in every bush.</span></p> <p><span>The Senator's fear of using American power borders on the pathological.  He has opposed the deployment of US troops to Grenada and Lebanon, he refuses to commit American forces directly in order to keep open the vital Straits of Hormuz, through which much of the Western world's imported oil flows, and now he wants America to abandon Central America.</span></p> <p><span>The Senator's quest for the Democratic Presidential nomination has led him to harp constantly on America's bitter memory of its involvement in Southeast Asia.  He sees Central America, and particularly El Salvador, as a quagmire that will once again suck in American blood and money endlessly and without course.</span></p> <p><span>Hart charges Reagan with leading this country into another unwinnable war in that region, and charges Mondale with supporting Reagan's views.  Hart has even prepared a campaign ad that pictures a burning fuse and that accuses Mondale of failing to learn \"the lessons of Vietnam\" in Central America Hart argues that arms might not solve problems which stem from poverty, hunger, and disease.  The Senator wants the U.S. immediately to \"withdraw military forces introduced into Costa Rica. El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, or Nicaragua for training exercises or any other purpose...\"</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE problem with Hart's approach is that it misinterprets the past and provides no program for the future El Salvador is not Vietnam, and to withdraw our troops precipitously, or even at all, would make a mockery of American policy and power in a region that is of vital importance to us.</span></p> <p><span>The differences in scale between El Salvador and Vietnam are obvious.  Vietnam was a huge nation with a population of over 40 million:  El Salvador is a tiny country that boasts less than 5 million inhabitants.  Vietnam was thousands upon thousands of miles away:  San Salvador is closer to Washington than San Fransisco.</span></p> <p><span>The nature of the conflict is also dissimilar.  In Vietnam, we unwittingly fought not against communism, but rather Vietnamese nationalism.  Ho Chi Minh succeeded not as an exponent of class struggle, but of national struggle:  Vietnamese saw him as the leader who would free them from the colonial subjugation that had started with the Chinese, continued with the French, and would end with the Americans.</span></p> <p><span>El Salvador, however has no recent and bitter memory of foreign oppression.  There is no group or leader that holds a monopoly on the national identity.  The problem is rather one of security and basic economic and political fairness.  And this problem is one we are trying to address.</span></p> <p><span>A recent Hart commercial, referring to Central America, warned that \"those who make Peaceful Change impossible make Violent Revolution inevitable.\"  One wonders if the Senator has paid much attention to American diplomacy in Central America over the last decade.  The March 25 election, for instance, would never have occurred without American efforts.</span></p> <p><span>Despite guerilla intimidation and widespread confusion over election rules, well over a million Salvadorans went to the polls to choose their President.</span></p> <p><span>It is true that the electoral process in El Salvador was by no means perfect.  Salvadorans felt much pressure to get an election stamp on their identity cards.  Leftist candidates could not participate for fear of assassination.</span></p> <p><span>But the desire for a stamped identity card simply can't explain why so many Salvadorans would go so far and wait so long to vote when simple excuses--guerilla intimidation or bureaucratice confusion--could always explain an abstention.  And most importantly, the voters had a clear choice:  they could pick either the murderous reactionary D'Abuisson or the conservative Guerrero and moderate Duarte.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps an even more far-reaching change has been the introduction of agrarian reform, another program sponsored by the U.S.  The break-up of large landed estates has fundamentally eroded the power of the authoritarian elite and benefited tens of thousands of Salvadoran peasants.  The redistribution of land, while in many cases working imperfectly and under attack, nonetheless represents a fundamental break with El Salvador's oligarchic past.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>F COURSE, despite these reforms, the situation in El Salvador remains bad.  Right-wing death squads murder hundreds of civilians a month.  Left-wing insurgents are groing in strength; they control one-fourth of the country and have brought the economy to a standstill with their constant attacks on the country's infrastructure.</span></p> <p><span>But precisely these problems argue against American disengagement.  Without America military support and advisors, the Salvadoran government would be hard pressed to survive.  Violence would only increase as rightists lashed out in desperation and left-wing guerillas pressed their offensive across the nation.  Improvements brought about by careful American diplomacy would be thrown to the winds.  Before long, whatever remained of the country would fall under Marxist domination.</span></p> <p><span>Some might argue that it matters not whether a nation as small and insignificant as El Salvador becomes communist or partially democratic.  Yet to ignore ideology is to care little for one's own values.  The human rights situation in Communist nations is appalling, as it is in many other countries.  But no totalitarian regime has ever permitted a change of power, while many authoritarian government have done so--Argentina, Spain, and Greece are prominent examples.  A communist El Salvador would never allow true elections; a formerly authoritarian El Salvador is holding them right now.</span></p> <p><span>Our stake in El Salvador is not just moral:  it is also strategic.  Vietnam may have been on the other side of the world:  Central America is in our backyard.  A communist El Salvador would threaten vital American increase the pressure on democratic Honduras and Costa Rica.  The growing strength of revolutionary ideology on the isthmus would make the Panama Canal even more vulnerable to attack by terrorists or governments.  And a Marxist-dominated Central America would have much adverse effect on Mexico, which faces increasing demographic and political pressures in the years to come.</span></p> <p><span>The examples of the past have a way of being misapplied to the present.  Our experience in Southeast Asia does not teach us never to use force, but rather to employ it carefully.  As Walter Mondale points out, \"The lesson from Vietnam is not that we should forgo power everywhere at all times.\"  But Gary Hart apparently wants to do just that.  By unilaterally withdrawing American military might from Central America, he would foresake the chance for democratic change and endanger our own backyard.  Hart's battle is long over:  it does not belong in an area so close and so vital to us.</span></p>"}

After four years of internecine conflict and 50,000 deaths, the people of El Salvador desperately desire order and a halt to the bloodletting.  Voters may be tempted then to choose the toughest-talking candidate, Roberto d'Aubuisson, the reactionary leader of the National Republican Alliance and a man linked at least indirectly to the right wing death squads.</span></p> <p><span>But if the polls are any indication, Salvadorans instead appear to lean towards moderate Jose Napoleon Duarte of the Christian Democrats, who, from 1980-82, led the junta that succeeded decades of military rule.  Although once considered a viable dark horse, National Conciliation Party candidate Francisco Jose Guerrero now ranks third behind Duarte and d'Aubuisson.

Like the extreme right wing factions of the army who support him, d'Aubuisson has pledged to fight the leftist guerrillas to the death as well as vowing to put a stop once and for all to the currently stalled land reform program.</span></p> <p><span>Because of d'Aubuisson's blatant disregard, nay, hostility, towards human rights, his election would most likely force Congress to withdraw military aid to El Salvador list it forfeit any of the moral high ground U.S. foreign policy so aspires to.  Moreover, the thought of a cut-off of its blood line would, immediately, pit much of the army against d'Aubuisson.  Thus, the political floor work would hopefully collapse from underneath d'Aubuisson before the entire country blew up, the latter being the most likely outcome.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE HOPE RESTS, albeit precariously, with Duarte.  True, rumors abound that a Duarte victory would prompt a coup by the extremist parts of the army, who view Duarte as a dyed-in-the-wool Communist.  But most sections of the armed forces will move probably regard a Duarte government at the surest way to keep the dollars coming.</span></p> <p><span>Duarte's biggest asset remains, however, his open mind toward the insurgents, whose participation is key to any political solution, along with ties he developed with other moderate leaders stemming from their united opposition to military rule.  Throughout the campaign Duarte has promised to open up dialogue with the guerrillas and enable them to participate--in municipal elections two years hence--the only way to break the bloody stalemate.</span></p> <p><span>Aside from Duarte winning at the polls and the bulk of the army keeping its cool, no short order in itself, progress in El Salvador rides on a change in U.S. attitudes.  Force, it should be finally realized, is unlikely to solve problems anywhere south of the border.  Bringing the moderates in the government and guerrillas together for dialogue aimed at ending the civil war and constructing as broadly based a government as possible in the splintered country should be given top priority.</span></p> <p><span>The Reagan Administration has long opposed discussions between the government and the guerrillas that would feature the topic of power sharing for the simple reason that it objects to the idea of any group shooting its way to power.  But whether the Administration likes it or not, the leftists, by virtue of the one third of the countryside they control, have de facto power.  Furthermore, their strength shows no signs of abating despite increased U.S. aid and training to the Salvadoran army.  In short, peace will forever remain elusive in El Salvador without an agreement with the leftists.</span></p> <p><span>For the moment, Americans should pray for a Durarte victory, a demonstration of restraint on the part of the army and a stroke of enlightenment in Washington.  Although nothing obstructs another violent cardiac arrest in this modern day heart of darkness.  Duarte alone represents the narrow path out from bloodshed to the still distant peace in Central America.</span></p>"}

The solutions to society's problems need not be sample, but if government provides no answers, it is no government--or at least bad government And nowhere is strong governmental guidance more important than with burning, divisive social issues such as racial or sexual discrimination, without federal leadership, progress toward equality for all will stagnate in the face of countless local battles.</span></p> <p><span>To the extent that affirmative action programs have helped reverse the impact of discriminatory hiring practices and few would argue that some progress has not been made they have succeeded because of strong federal support for such measures in the face of local indifference, or outright hostility.  But the Reagan Administration has not only repudiated its leadership role in advancing equal opportunity.  It has also actively worked to undermine strong historical and legal precedents for affirmative action.</span></p> <p><span>What about Blacks and women?</span></p> <p><span>What about white men?</span></p> <p><span>The Birmingham, Alabama police and fire departments didn't look like the rest of Birmingham.  While the city was 54 percent Black, and, presumably, about 50 percent female, its police and firefighting forces were almost monolithically white and male.  The city was taken to task by the Justice Department for a pervasive \"pattern and practice\" of discrimination against Blacks and women.  The court-ordered affirmative action plan, which became law in 1981, called for numerical goals to ensure the hiring and promotion of qualified individuals from the disadvantaged groups.</span></p> <p><span>But 10 white, male members of the police and fire departments are now suing for reverse discrimination, claiming they were unfairly denied promotions because of the court-mandated plan.  They argue that less-qualified women and Blacks were awarded the promotions to meet \"numerical quotas\" net by the courts.  And just last week the Reagan Justice Department, which itself signed the 1981 court decree calling for preferential hiring, entered the suit on the side of the male plaintiffs.  Although the department states it does not yet know if the charges to reverse discrimination are valid, it stands solidly behind their attack on quotas.  William Bradford Reynolds, assistant attorney general for civil rights, blithely explains:  \"We always side with those people who claim they have suffered discrimination on account of race.\"</span></p> <p><span>What about remedial action?</span></p> <p><span>What about seniority?</span></p> <p><span>Like Birmingham's, the Boston police and fire departments were not representative of the population they serve.  Finding past discrimination, the courts ordered a preferential hiring plan.  All went more or less smoothly until Proposition 2 1/2 slashed city revenues, forcing layoffs in the departments.  Under the last-in-first-out policies of the police and fire forces, the bulk of the employees who would have lost their jobs due to the cutbacks were the newly hired women and minorities--effectively negating the effects of the affirmative action plan.  When the department altered its seniority plan somewhat to preserve some of the effects of the affirmative action plan, several white officers sued for reverse discrimination.  The Reagan Justice Department filled in support of the white officers.</span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>OW ENCOURAGING that the Reagan regime has taken an interest in affirmative action, but how tragic that it has concerned itself with the wrong side of the coin.  Affirmative action is not a discretionary tool to be employed at whim; rather, it represents the best available legal remedy for past and current discrimination that has severely eroded any true measure of equality in the American economy.  But in both word and deed, the Reagan Administration has seriously undermined the legitimacy of affirmative action nationwide.</span></p> <p><span>While seniority plans have been considered somewhat immune from affirmative action measures, the Birmingham program now under attack is a typical remedial hiring program.  Although the plan does include the use of quotas--the most extreme and most controversial affirmative action method--those numerical goals have repeatedly been approved, and often mandated, by the courts.  Typically, they are applied where less stringent measures have failed to bring about change.</span></p> <p><span>The white officers to date have brought at least six legal challenges against the city's affirmative action plan, all of which have failed.  They are, of course, within their legal rights to launch yet another assault, but the Justice Department is under no obligation to join them on the warpath.</span></p> <p><span>If the Reagan Administration was under any obligation in the Birmingham case, it can only be to support the city and come down squarely against the rising calls to reverse discrimination that have grossly distorted the purpose and meaning of affirmative action.</span></p> <p><span>In the face of continued widespread discriminatory hiring patterns and practices, it is no wonder that women and minorities find it hard to take seriously the complaints of white males.  No affirmative action plan--including Birmingham's--has ever sanctioned lowering standards for women and minorities; instead, they call on employers to speed the placement of qualified female and minority applicants where it has been found that past discriminatory treatment has excluded them from these jobs.  Even under the Birmingham program--which has successfully improved the composition of the city's police and fire fighting forces--whites continue to be hired and promoted in greater numbers than Blacks and women.</span></p> <p><span>For the Justice Department to throw its weight behind what is a largely spurious charge is nothing short of irresponsible.  In a speech at Harvard earlier this week, Eleanor Holmes-Norton, chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under Carter, accused the Reagan Administration of \"escalating the drumbeat\" of reverse discrimination charges.  Her attack is well grounded--the Administration has sided with whites claiming reverse discrimination in suits in Detroit, Memphis, and New Orleans in addition to the Boston and Birmingham cases.</span></p> <p><span>By adding fuel to the fire reverse discrimination, the Administration threatens to reopen the painful civil rights battles of the 1960s and 1970s.  Former Birmingham mayor David Vann told <i>The New York Times</i> that most of the city's population--Black and white--had accepted the preferential hiring plan as fair until the Justice Department reversed its position, saying \"what was right is now wrong.\"</span></p> <p><span>In addition, attacks on the plan can only work to undermine progress toward affirmative action elsewhere:  caught between the dual threats of discrimination suits by whites if they do, and by women and minorities if they don't, most employers will probably seek to avoid the issue of fair hiring practices entirely.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>FFIRMATIVE ACTION was not intended to be either perfect or permanent.  It has evolved, through countless legal battles, is the only workable means of redressing past discrimination in a timely manner.  To assert, as the Reagan Administration implicitly does, that the United States has arrived at such a harmoniously just state that continued remedial action is no longer necessary would be laughable were it not so sinister.  As Norton states.  \"The fact is that the new equality in American life is a function of the new remedies.\"  Take away the remedies, prematurely, and persistent racial and sexual discrimination--now, under heavy assault--will enjoy a renaissance.</span></p> <p><span>The Reagan Administration's stance is malicious because it spotlights, the controversial and often imperfect faces of affirmative action without offering any constructive alternative; it tenaciously upholds rights as previously defined by the system while wholly ignoring the rights of those who have been excluded from the system entirely.</span></p> <p><span>Rights-based 'criticisms of affirmative action are not new, nor are they specious.  Recent years have witnessed heightened debate from those who believe society can never deviate from absolute race-and sex-blind treatment--even to reverse the effects of past discrimination.</span></p> <p><span>Such legal purism may be appealing in the abstract, but it is both unrealistic and inadequate in the face of the reality of America's history of racism and sexism.  And together with those whose distaste for affirmative action is less ideologically motivated, these objections indicate the limits of American commitment to full equality.</span></p> <p><span>Affirmative action is seen as acceptable, even desirable, but only so long as it does not harm a single hair on a single white male head.  Given the sweeping, long-term effects of past discrimination affirmative action under such strictures would be tantamount to no affirmative action at all, If our society is so shortsighted as to be unwilling to undergo limited short-term departures from absolute \"equal treatment\" for even so important a goal as racial and sexual equality, then social justice for all-but-the-most powerful does not stand much of a chance in this country.</span></p>"}

The stakes behind the question are high.  It is much easier to organize workers in one part of the University than all across campus.</span></p> <p><span>Last week's victory came when the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) overturned a seven year-old decision on an old debate about rules.

The Board reversed the earlier ruling.</span></p> <p><span>\"We thought the 1977 decision was wrong and are very pleased it has been overturned.\"  University Vice President and General Counsel Daniel Steiner '54 said this week.</span></p> <p><span>Union organizers are refusing to call the NLRB ruling a setback, saying only that it was a disappointment and attributing it to politics.  The NLRB has adopted a decidedly pro-management stance under the Reagan Administration, says Harvard UAW organizer Kristine Rondeau.</span></p> <p><span>But the decision does give the union a much longer row to hoe now.

But the union does take credit for pressuring Harvard into increasing some wages and benefits and improving working conditions.</span></p> <p><span>However, Rondeau points out that 82 percent of those eligible for membership if unionization is successful are women, who are traditionally lower-paid than men.  And the union has not backed off its call for a fairer grievance procedure, higher pay, a dental plan, comprehensive health insurance and daycare.</span></p> <p><span>Steiner, however, contends that the University's policies are fair and said he has never seen \"a union program that addresses personnel concerns in a way better than they are now being addressed at Harvard.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Hart's Smoking Gun | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>M</b>UCH HAS been made of Democratic Presidential aspirant Gary W. Hart's (D-Colo.) appeal to the emerging political bloc of young urban professionals, or yuppies.  But more scrutiny should go to the Colorado Senator's flirtation with an older, more established constituency--thousands of urban gun holders, or thugs.</span></p> <p><span>Though Hart and his chief rival, Walter F. Mondale, are indeed quite similar on several key issues, they differ substantially on at least one vital concern--gun control.  Democrats mesmerized by Hart's futuristic visions should pause to consider their candidate's stand on this question, and what it indicates about his candidacy.</span></p> <p><span>The clear contrast between the contenders over gun control emerged at the end of last Wednesday's nationally televised Columbia University debate when moderator Dan Rather asked for a brief position on the issue.  The Rev. Jesse Jackson endorsed several strong measures; Mondale said he supported a ban on the sale, manufacturing and possession of Saturday night specials, or snub-nosed pistols.  Hart, without qualification, said he opposed federal control of handguns.</span></p> <p><span>Actually, Hart's stance is not quite so simple.  A spokesman for the Washington-based Handgun Control, Inc. says the lobbying group received a statement from the Hart campaign the day of the debate explaining that the Senator favors a federally mandated \"cooling off period,\" a 14-day gap between the time someone applies to purchase a gun and the actual sale, to allow officials to investigate the purchaser's record.  He also indicated that he would endorse federal legislation regulating the importing and interstate sales of handguns, and mandatory additional sentencing for the use of firearms in a federal crime.</span></p> <p><span>One possible way to reconcile these opposing stances is to look at the definition of the word \"control.\"  While most people define gun control as any sort of regulation.  Hart apparently says control implies a ban or confiscation, which he opposes.  A Hart spokesman explains the seeming contradiction this way:  Rather's question in the debate was \"too broad\" and did not allow for Hart's more sophisticated approach.  The spokesman adds that Hart opposes \"traditional,\" forms of gun control-- such as a ban--because they would be ineffective, and that the candidate is open to new proposals, although he has none of his own.</span></p> <p><span>There is, unfortunately, no record to pin Hart down on.  He has repeatedly said that he has never supported a federal gun control measure.  But that is hardly a meaningful claim since the question has only reached the Senate floor twice--in 1968 and 1972--while Hart first reached Washington in 1975.</span></p> <p><span>As a result, Hart's \"flexible\" approach to the issue makes it difficult to evaluate precisely what a Hart Administration would do on gun control.  But even if Hart's strongest statements accurately reflect his position, such measures would fall far short of what is needed to curb domestic violence.  The simple fact is that more than 50 million handguns are is circulation in the United States today, and the number grows by two million a year.  More than 11,000 Americans fall victim each year to handgun deaths.  Hart's proposals are unlikely to lower this toll.  His suggested background check would have little impact.  First, states which already have such procedures acknowledge that because of limited police resources, they rarely run the examination.  Second, a large portion of violent crimes are committed by those without a previous record.  Finally, established criminals would have no problem buying weapons \"hot\" or simply stealing them.</span></p> <p><span>Hart's mandatory additional sentencing is also weak--if a criminal is not deterred by a possible 10-year sentence for robbery, the risk of drawing an extra five years for doing it armed would probably mean little.</span></p> <p><span>Logic dictates that the best way to limit handgun deaths is to limit the supply of handguns.  Some, such as Hart, base their opposition to such restrictions on the assertion that a bun is ineffective.  Yet most of Western Europe, Japan and Canada have either bans or very strict regulations, or registrations and suffer much lower murder rates.  Hart's true reluctance to embrace such a measure, an side acknowledged in an interview, lies partly in his belief that somehow people have some right to own whatever weapon they choose.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT HART'S position on gun control is not only inadequate on its merits, it also raises broader doubts about the Senator's desirability as a candidate.  Specifically, it seriously challenges Hart's contentions that he offers fresh solutions and can resist the pull of \"special interests.\"</span></p> <p><span>At a Syracuse press conference, the candidate said that gun control was not a high priority of his and expressed doubts about whether New Yorkers were overly concerned with the issue, despite the statements and action of local officials to the contrary.  This was in character for a man who--despite talking in complex, detailed, academic sounding jargon--has a rather simple world view.  To Hart, all domestic issues seem subsumed by the overriding concern of economic growth.  There is a very rigid formula for attaining that goal and exceptions do not exist.</span></p> <p><span>In the 90 pages Hart's campaign book <i>A New Democracy</i> devotes to revitalizing the economy, not one parenthetical expression acknowledges that certain demographic groups fare worse than others, even during prosperity, and no special provisions are outlined.  Hart seems to be saying that social concerns are secondary to economic ones, and that solving economic dilemmas will cure the social ills.  That is why he irritates \"paleo-liberals\"--not because of the policies he supports, but because of the problems he ignores.  It is not enough to simply vote the right way on a bill when it comes up; a President sets the agenda by taking the lead and demonstrating commitment.</span></p> <p><span>Hart's lack of commitment has led him to overlook racial discrimination, as well as other social problems such as crime.  It is why his staff has yet to draft an issues paper on the subject of domestic violence, and why he can blithely oppose gun control without feeling compelled to come up with an alternative.</span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>ART'S handling of the gun control issue also helps put the lie to his more-independent-than-thou image.  If the candidate's Isreali embassy flip flop failed to convince observers of his susceptibility to special-interstates, his un control waffle should persuade them.</span></p> <p><span>Hart did not hurt himself by flatly declaring on national television--which includes in its audience the Western states, where anti-gun control fever is high, and where the voters have yet to vote in the primaries--that he is against federal gun control, then telling reporters in New York--where a majority of the voters favor gun control--that he backs some restrictions.  He all but conceded duplicity when, in a <i>New York Times</i> interview, \"he acknowledged that he was walking a fine line between his role as a Colorado Senator whose constituents strongly oppose federal gun control laws and as a Presidential candidate eager to win the New York primary.\"</span></p> <p><span>Gary Hart's aversion to effective domestic arms control has gotten little attention, but with more exposure it should jar some of his backers into reconsidering their positions.  His stance is disturbing not only on the merits of the issue alone, but also because it shoots a few holes in his image.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Long March | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE SUPER TUESDAY installment of the Democratic primary serial provided some exciting new twists in a campaign that has already seen its share of remarkable reverses.  First, Fritz Mondale seemed mighty and invincible.  Then, Gary Hart (D--Colo.) seemed confident and unstoppable.  Now it looks like we're in store for a protracted race in which a clear front-runner may never emerge.  Only one thing is clear, the road to the Democratic.  Party convention in San Francisco is tile with pot holes and the party is riding on shocks that are already worn Prospects for victory in November get dimmer with every bump along the trail.</span></p> <p><span>The Democrats' chances of turning Ronald Reagan out of the White House never looked particularly promising, even when the party seemed unified and Mondale's nomination appeared inevitable.  The fact that seven other candidates showed up at the starting gate should have been a tip-off that this would be no live furlong romp.  Now that the shine of the Mondale machine has been dulled by Florida sun and New England must and snow, new possibilities seem to be popping up every day.  In the most interesting scenario, neither Hart not Mondale is able to nail down enough delegates, and the convention is forced to nominate a compromise candidate.  Although if sounds far-fetched, it may become a necessary alternative.</span></p> <p><span>Despite his massive campaign machine and a boatload of endorsements.  Walter Mondale has never been a particularly strong candidate.  His career has been that of a dutiful, party, oriented politician who has moved patiently up the ladder.  He is an organization man, the kind of politician who used to run for President back when the Chief Executive's most important job was administering federal patronage.  In those days, the parties themselves placed the key role in turning out the vote, and the candidate's own personal its often became secondary.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately for Fritz, the age of network new sound <i>People</i> magazine has changed politics drastically.  It is no longer a mere contest of organizational skill and horse-trading, but of marketing, and media manipulation as well.</span></p> <p><span>It is not insignificant that the high point of Mr. Mondale's campaign thus far came when he appropriated a now legendary line from a Wendy's hamburger commercial.  The cry of \"Where's the Beef?\" was no surprise, coming as it did from a man who had already told the AFL-CIO that they deserved a break, but silly slogans can't build a Presidential image.  It is overall perceptions that make a difference, and Mondale's images is decidedly Quaker Oats with an electorate that seems to gravitate toward Frosted Flakes.  What's inside may be good for you, but the package is dull, traditional and unenticing.</span></p> <p><span>Surface perceptions have become increasingly important in the face of a more fluid electorate.  Party identification has fallen steadily in the past twenty years and ticket splitting is no longer regarded as a sin.  In order to win, a candidate must attract a majority of the independent voters who do not identify strongly with either of the major parties.  These are the hard sell voters who can often be swayed, in the end, by skillful image-making.</span></p> <p><span>The trend is real, \"but there is no reason to be inordinately concerned about the danger of elevating style over substance:  in reality, there is a very strong correlation between the two.  Walter Mondale is viewed as bland and traditional because he has staked out a position as a cautious and experienced politician, and he has focussed on the old Democratic issues--fairness, aid to the poor and the unemployed, etc.  While this helps him with the old-line party groups like Blacks, industrial union members, and lower income people, it hurts him with the independents.</span></p> <p><span>On the other hand, Gary Hart's focus on economic revitalization and military reform hits home with the most important segments of non-aligned voters--young professionals, college graduates, and middle-income people.  His image as the man with new ideas grows out of his proposals in these areas.</span></p> <p><span>But it is likely that both candidates will have a problem wooing the other's supporters Blacks and many lower income union members see Hart as a rich man's Democrat.  Independents are put off by Mondale's apparent lack of independence from special interest groups.</span></p> <p><span>Yet the Senator from Colorado has several distinct advantages over his opponent as a general election contender His public personal is not yet cast in stone.  Overall, his record on traditional Democratic issues is good, though not as sterling as the former Vice-President's.  He still has an opportunity to reach out to the poor and the unemployed and prove his liberal credentials.  Faced with the alternative of Hart or Reagan, their choice would be clear.</span></p> <p><span>Mondale, on the other hand, has almost no credibility with Hart's independent constituency, many of whom spurned the Carter Mondale ticket in 1980 to vote for Reagan or Anderson.  These are the voters whom the Democratic nominee must attract, and Mondale has run just the kind of campaign that will drive them over to Reagan in the fall.  If he gets the nomination, it will be extremely difficult for him to alter his image sufficiently to prevent a surge of independents to the Republican ticket.  Not only would the Democrats' hopes for the Presidency be dashed, but vulnerable right-wing senators like Gordon Humphrey and Jesse Helms could be swept back into office for another six years on such a Republican tide.</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, in the aftermath of the Illinois primary Mondale may have regained the upper hand, if not front-runner status.  Even though his general election prospects look bleak, he retains a distinct advantage in the upcoming weeks of balloting.  The next two major campaign events, in New York and Pennsylvania, are closed primaries, which leave independents locked out of the voting booth.  Victories in both of these states would give Mondale a significant delegate lead and leave Hart struggling to catch up in the relative dearth of big events between Pennsylvania on April 10th and the Texas caucuses on May 5th.</span></p> <p><span>Gary Hart's best chance for victory always lay in the possibility of embarrassing his opponent with a string of impressive victories, but Michigan and Illinois cut that string short.  It is now very unlikely that either candidate can force the other out of the race before the convention.  At this point, in order to have a chance at winning the nomination.  Hart must take the lead in delegate strength by winning delusive victories in western primaries and caucuses, especially California on June 5th.  If he does not, and Mondale appears to be within striking distance of a majority, then organization politics will take over and hand the prize to the man from Minnesota.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>F THE TWO candidates end the primary season at roughly equal strength, the potential for a wild and politically bloody convention is great.  A divisive floor fight for the nomination would be a disaster for the Democrats and would undoubtedly produce a nominee so wounded by his own party that chances for victory in November would be nil.  If the two men seem to be dendlocked in June, the best solution would be the selection of a compromise candidate.  Perhaps someone who has already dropped out of the race, or a name that has only briefly been mentioned thus far (Dale Bumpers, Jim Wright, or Mario Cuomo).  Anyone nominated under such unusual circumstances would face an uphill fight, but his or her chances would be somewhat better than those of a candidate destroyed by intraparty feuding.</span></p> <p><span>In the end, the big winner in this election year may be George McGovern.  The former Senator from South Dakota has already won back a respected position as an elder statesman within his party.  And if Walter Mondale emerges from a divisive race as the Democratic nominee, then people just may end up forgetting about that old '72 landslide too.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Marines:  It's Time to Leave | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>O</b>STENSIBLY, the U.S. Marines were sent to Lebanon to stabilize internal conflict there sparked by the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the tenuous installation of the Gemayel government.  So the realization that, on balance, the Marines' presence seems to heighten rather than diminish conflict within that country leads to a simple conclusion:  they should be recalled.</span></p> <p><span>Since their arrival in Lebanon, the Marine troops have drawn and, more recently, returned bullets and heavy shelling.  Nothing seems more antithetical to the purpose of a peacekeeping mission than the sight of the guns of the New Jersey pounding the hills outside Beirut to protect U.S. ground forces there--a scene re-enacted only days ago.  This newest layer of violence in a country already \"blessed\" with more than its due, is a straightforward and compelling case for withdrawal.</span></p> <p><span>Not, however, compelling enough for those most industrious of foreign policy advisors, the \"face savers,\" who claim a Marine withdrawal would be perceived as a defeat for the United States.  But this is a strange argument if we recall that the Marines were sent to Lebanon not to gain face but, rather, peace.  Nor were they sent for a host of equally flabby reasons now being bandied about as arguments against withdrawal.  Last week, for example, a congressman remarked that a U.S. withdrawal would give a green light to terrorism around the world.  Now President Reagan has adeptly identified terrorism as a growing U.S. foreign policy concern, but when has he ever identified the Marine presence in Lebanon as the definitive launching point of his anti-terrorism crusade?</span></p> <p><span>Other critics of withdrawal argue that, while the Marines were <i>ostensibly</i> sent as a peacekeeping force, their true mission is to preserve U.S. strategic interests in the region--namely a democratic and pro-Western Gemayel government.  But if this was the true Administrative intent behind the mission, it was not the basis on which Congress and, tacitly, the American public, sanctioned the stationing of Marines in Beirut.</span></p> <p><span>A foreign policy in Lebanon that pursues U.S. strategic interests without regard for the rights and wishes of the Lebanese people themselves would be morally reprehensible.  Further, it is clear that current U.S. policy is failing even with regard to purely strategic considerations; the Marines hunkered around the Beirut Airport clearly are not capable of effectively com-batting Syrian influence in the region.</span></p> <p><span>The Marines were stationed in Beirut not as a combat force, but in the reasonable hope that they could provide a neutral, stabilizing force in the vacuum created by the Israeli withdrawal.  Sadly, they have failed in this task--largely because they are viewed by most Lebanese (and, most likely, the Gemayel government itself) as anything but neutral.  In an already bulletridden nation, the Marines have become just another target.</span></p> <p><span>In light of this country's long term interests in Lebanon--peace and the establishment of a government willing to cooperate with the U.S.--President Reagan should withdraw the marines and step up diplomatic efforts in Lebanon.  So long as rival factions within Lebanon feel they have no stake in their government, that country will be fertile ground for violence from all quarters and immune to \"peacekeeping.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "Gender Gaps | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>\"I</b>DON'T CROSS ANY bridges before I come to them, nor do I burn them.\"  Such was the purposely evasive reply last November by newly elected governor of Kentucky Martha Layne Collins to  reporter's questions concerning her Vice Presidential hopes, if any, in '34.  In San Antonio this past summer, the National Women's Political Caucus--supposedly bipartisan--received a parade of Democratic Presidential hopefuls, and all of them gave at least vague assurances of a possible woman running mate and similar goodies in return for support against the GOP.  Around the same time President Reagan made a completely innocent gaffe to a woman's group about the civilizing effect of women on men (\"if it weren't for you we men would still be walking around in skins\") and put both his advisors and the media in an uproar for days.  The so-called \"gender gap\" has become one hot-political item.</span></p> <p><span>What exactly is this \"gender gap\"?  Why are both Democrats and Republicans eyeing it with increasing interest, the former with growing glee and the latter with growing discomfort?  Why, after 63 years of women's suffrage, should the fact of being a female voter(or a male one for that matter) color a choice in the voting booth?</span></p> <p><span>First off, it's a very real phenomenon, at least insofar as public opinion polls are real.  In the sense in which the term was originally coined, that is, strictly referring to support of the President and his policies, the gap is considerable and apparently growing.  Last fall Mr. Reagan's overall approval rating showed a nine-point differential between women and men polled by <i>Newsweek.</i>  Individual ratings on issues--the economy, defense, foreign policy--showed similar variations.  The Democrats have treated all of these poll results as potential election year gold.  Not surprisingly, the White House and the Republican Party are not at all happy about these data, but the leadership seems wary and ultimately optimistic, which has been a familiar Reagan hallmark anyway.  A \"wait-and-see\" attitude has apparently been adopted by Reagan  ad his advisors.</span></p> <p><span>Why are the Democrats viewing themselves as the automatic beneficiaries of this \"gap\"?  After all, most of the polls simply ask variation of the \"do you like Reagan?\"  theme.  Only a few have asked choice questions (Reagan vs, Mondale, Republicans vs. Democrats) with little or no sign of a male/female split.  When the question moves away from generalities and Reagan's image, it becomes much more complicated, and the Democrats don't look quite to attuned to the needs and aspiration of women as they would like to appear.</span></p> <p><span>All six major Democratic campaign managers are men.  Of the other women advisors apparently only two press secretaries, Maxine Isaacs for Walter Mondale and Kathy Bushkin for Gary Hart, wield any real influence.  Similarly for the 'consultants\" and other heavyweights who gravitate around campaigns:  They are mostly men and this augurs ill for women's hopes in a Democratic cabinet in '85.</span></p> <p><span>Contrast this to the Reagan Administration.  For the first time in history, three women hod Cabinet-level posts simultaneously, all at the behest of Reagan--Jeanne Kirkpatrick at the U.N., Margaret Heckler at Health and Human Services, and Elizabeth Dole at the Department of Transportation.  His lower-level appointments of women do not match up numerically with Jimmy Carter's at a similar point in Administration--95 to 113 for posts needing Senate confirmation, 10 to 18 for Federal judgeships--but he made history by appointing Sandra Day O'Vonnor to the Supreme Court.  Also, comparison with Carter amounts to comparison with probably the most progressive President in history regarding the hiring of women.  On balance, Mr. Reagan has certainly not had a poor record with respect to women in government, and it positively glows compared to the Democratic candidates' performance thus far.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HY, THEN, DOES Ronald Reagan seem to be heading for an increasingly ominous (from the Republican point of view) male/female split in November?  In his own defense Reagan has declared support for the \"E\" and the \"R,\" but not the \"A\"--in short, for legislation, on both the state and federal level, to remove the remaining blemishes on legal equality.  To this end, he has appointed a task force to search out egregious state laws discriminating against women, and to recommend corrective action.  However, many such laws have been found, and none have been addressed by the Justice Department during the Administration's tenure.  Certainly this glaring question mark could become part of the Democratic arsenal against the incumbent.  It would lend some meat to the predominantly \"image\"-type denunciations thus far.</span></p> <p><span>This leads to the \"fairness\" issue, and interestingly enough, the same <i>Newsweek</i> poll which showed an overall gap showed that economic and social policies, along with defense and foreign policy, have more importance for women than ERA and other \"women's\" issues.  Reagan's well-known ideological desire for less government has produced the well-documented attack on a whole variety of social assistance programs.  One of the great tragedies of the last 20 years is that women have increasingly borne a disproportionate share of this hardship.</span></p> <p><span>Fully three quarters of America's elderly poor are women.  Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the backbone of welfare, goes almost exclusively to women heads of families.  Food stamps, Medicare, and some types of Social Security are predominantly consumed by poor women, often with children.  The Administration's attempt to slash these programs has thus amounted unfortunately to a cut in aid to poor women.  The widespread decay of the \"traditional\" family which actually produced this situation belies one of Reagan's (and Phyllis Shlafly's, et. al.) main objections to the ERA--that somehow it will promote further erosion of family values and of the place of the homemaker in society.  However, both of these \"traditional' concepts have taken such a  beating over the last couple of decades that nothing Washington can do, short of totalitarian enforcement of morals, will either accelerate or retard this sad process.</span></p> <p><span>Precisely because not many daddy-mommy-children arrangements along Reagan's line of thinking exist any longer, Republican Party ideology would not be sullied by an affirmation of the ERA.  In fact, often forgotten in the current polarization is the GOP's traditional support of the Amendment and its spirit of human worth shared equally.  Republican Congressmen were the first to introduce it, in 1923.  The Republican Party was the first to call for it in a platform, in 1940.  Since then, the Republican Convention has failed to approve it only three times, in '64, '68, and '80.  The Democrats have affirmed it only four times in the same period.  One of the Republicans' truly concrete objections--that women would be subject to a draft--could be solved by continuation of the current policy of non-combat designation for women in the volunteer military.  Under an ERA, women probably would, and certainly should, be subject to a draft.  Defending one's country is neither a feminine nor a masculine issue.  It is simply a duty that should be shared equally by all, and excluding women from combat positions would not harm that spirit in the slightest.</span></p> <p><span>We are left, then, with some sobering thoughts, and a clear-cut \"male vs. female, Republican vs. Democrats' choice at all.  Some Reagan initiatives have specifically benefited most women; a reduction of the \"marriage penalty,\" an increase in child care tax credits, provisions for improved collection of a child support payments, and a proposed increase in the amount homemakers may contribute to tax-free IRA.  It is indeed unfortunate that, in the process of carrying out as much of his ideological program as he can, Mr. Reagan has managed to hurt poor women and minorities disproportionately.  Even extreme liberals must acknowledge that the primary reason for this lies in socioeconomic trends and changes far beyond the full control of any liberal democracy.  But by the same token Mr. Reagan's failure to see these realities at all constitute a corresponding failure of the very same liberal democracy, and this will be an enduring problem for whoever sits in the Oval Office in 1985.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, \"gender gap\" itself might be too narrowly defined.  Women are apparently objecting to whole parts of Reagan's program, and not merely to specifically \"feminist\" areas.  Should the Democrats necessarily see this in their favor?  Or should both parties realize that women are now exerting an entirely new form of political strength, a form which might batter a male Democratic President just as harshly as a Republican, and which might move the entire political spectrum bodily leftward?  If so, then a true feminist revolution may have started in 1980, when women voted significantly different from men for the first time.  Perhaps the real gap may be found in other numbers--only 24 women in Congress; three Cabinet secretaries; 8.7 percent of the nation's mayors; 13.3 percent in state legislatures; about 15 percent of town and council posts; and just one governor.  This is where the \"gap\" truly lies, and this is why it's somewhat premature to consider any American woman for Vice President in '84.  When this grass roots \"gap\" finally starts to close (and it looks like it will close going from right to left), American politics will never be the same, and women will come into their own.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Still the Wrong Prescription | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE FINDINGS of the National Bipartisan Commission on Central America published this week have, not surprisingly, reaffirmed the United States' vital stake in Central America.  For both humanitarian and security reasons the situation in the troubled region concerns us more than ever, the report states.  With that said, the 12 member panel headed by former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger '50 goes on to propose a set of conflicting solutions that if adopted as policy would inevitably fail to place Central America on the path to peace and prosperity.</span></p> <p><span>By emphasizing the social and economic dimensions of the Central.  American problem and suggesting the need for longterm answers, the Commission moves away from a total reliance on the hasty military measures for problems south of the border that have too often plagued U.S. foreign policy.  Nevertheless the ratio of military measures to social and economic ones endorsed by the report remains too high.</span></p> <p><span>As the report correctly notes, before any serious reforms and development can take place in Central America the path towards peace must be cleared of violence from both the right and the left.  Unfortunately, the contradictory measures prescribed to end the bloodshed promise only to prolong it.</span></p> <p><span>Kissinger and company urge a stepped up campaign by the Salvadoran Army in order to defeat the leftist insurgents and end the country's three-year civil war.  Although the group wisely rules out the use of any U.S. troops in El Salvador, it does call for a quadrupling of U.S. military aid in the next year to the order of $250 million, adding the important condition that aid be contingent on the Salvadoran Government's success on curbing the rightist death squads and securing basic human rights.  Such a condition, unlike in the past, must be strictly adhered to by both the President and Congress.</span></p> <p><span>But at the same time, the report asks the Salvadoran government to invite the rebel organizations to participate in the upcoming March elections and details plan to guarantee the fairness of the elections and the safety of all the participants.  The preparation of the Salvadoran Army for the knock-down blow of the guerrillas is sure to keep the rebels away from the voting booths and the negotiating table.  A far wiser course would be to delay increased military aid for El-Salvador and hope for signs of willingness to negotiate on the part of the insurgents.  This would give the rebels time and incentive to come to the bargaining table knowing that a potentially mightier opponent awaits it if it doesn't.</span></p> <p><span>For nearby Nicaragua, the Commission upholds President Reagan's view that the presence of a Soviet and Cuban backed government imperils regional security.  It demands the return of the Nicaraguan Revolution to its democratic course and the end to Communist meddling in the area.  Towards that goal the panel supports continued covert aid to the Contras as an incentive for the Sandinistas to grant greater freedom at home and negotiate a regional security settlement.</span></p> <p><span>Such a policy is misguided on two counts.  As the situation in El Salvador reveals, governments under siege have trouble maintaining open societies and often sacrifice civil liberties in turn for survival.  In addition, it would be foolish to think that even if Nicaraguan policies did finally meet with U.S. approval the Contras would stop fighting.  Most of these groups, peopled by members of Somoza's National Guards, do not seek the improvement of Nicaraguan society according to U.S. standards but control of that society itself.  They will neither give their U.S. arms back to their donors or stop using them.  The United States would be well advised to negotiate with the Nicaraguans and offer to withdraw support for the Contras provided the Sandinistas stop aiding Salvadoran guerrillas and reduce ties with the Cubans and Soviets.  Recent moves by the Sandinistas such as scheduling elections, expelling 2000 Cuban advisers and granting greater freedom to the opposition signal a willingness on the part of the Nicaraguans to come to terms with the U.S. Washington must seize this opportunity and pursue peaceful negotiations.</span></p> <p><span>It is the social and economic proposals of the report that Congress and the President must use as a foundation for consensus.  The report faces up to the realization that it will take many years and billions of dollars to reverse the decline in living standards from which Central America now suffers.  Although as the panel points out, much of Central America's future depends on the policies it adopts U.S. assistance is vital in providing the region with a head start.  Washington should continue its support for agrarian reform which will lessen the power of local oligarchies and offer the peasant some hope of livelihood.  In addition, the U.S. should be generous in supplying technical and monetary aid in helping the Central American nations diversity their agricultural sector so as to make countries more self-sufficient for food and less dependent on one crop economies.</span></p> <p><span>In a time of concern over increased deficits, the $8 billion in aid proposed by the commission over the next five years for Central America seems like an exorbitant sum.  Surely Congress and the President will work to pare that figure down in the future.  For now, Americans must discard the notion that shooting will bring peace to the region and sober up to the reality that there is no flight from commitment from Central America.  The cost in humanitarian and strategic terms is too great.</span></p>"}

Although the Commission does not have powers of enforcement, it was instrumental in shaping federal attitudes toward discrimination.  It also evaluates and criticizes federal programs and recommends changes to Congress and the President.  In such a capacity, the Commission's independence--from public, congressional, and executive political pressure--is crucial.</span></p> <p><span>The current composition of the eight-member Commission--half of whose members were appointed by Reagan--puts it in a precarious position and, more importantly, threatens to undermine its ability to attack civil rights violations.  Pendleton readily admits to sharing a political ideology with President Reagan.  Indeed, he sees his role as one of reaffirming the Reagan platform.  Says Pendleton, \"Reagan was elected because he promised civil rights for all Americans, not just traditionally ditreminited regarding success\".</span></p> <p><span>Two of the commissioners, Mary France Berry and Blandina Cardness Ramises-both of whom congress blocked Reagan from firing last October-have publicly lambassed for his ties with the Administration.  \"I am not sure what the relationship is, but the Chairman [Pendleton] mentions Ed Meese's name in every other sentence,\" Commissioner Ramirez, a three-year veteran on the board, charges.</span></p> <p><span>And the announcement of Meese as replacement for William French Smith as Attorney General simply completes the Administration's calculated gutting of the civil rights division of the Justice Department. Other components of Reagan's civil rights policy--some would say lack of a policy--have been his moves to reduce legal services (whose main recipients are minorities); advocacy of tax-exempt status for discriminatory colleges; opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment; and attempts to block an extension of the Voting Rights Act.</span></p> <p><span><b>BUT REAGAN</b> has covered his bases well in this election year.  His successful drive to dominate the Civil Rights Commission was a calculated attempt to gain more mainstream support and legitimacy for his anti-women, anti-minority, and anti-poor agents.</span></p> <p><span>The proceedings of the newly formed Commission's first meeting last week are a tribute to Reagan's success in molding this nation's 4 most influential civil rights agency.  In a succession of 6-2 votes, the Commission 1) criticized the Supreme Court for not reversing a lower court ruling upholding the use of numerical indicators in a Detroit affirmative action program, 2) criticized busing, even as the last available alternative to segregation, 3) expressed an interest in redefining \"discrimination,\" and 4) authorized a study of the \"adverse consequences of affirmative action programs on Americans of Eastern and Southern European descent.\"</span></p> <p><span>The reversal of the Commission's traditional stand on these issues could not have been more complete.  Ramirez, who, with Berry, clashed consistently with Pendleton in the two-day meeting, says she discerned a clear pattern in the voting.  First, the majority of the commissioners seek to protect Reagan from criticism they \"rush to support the Administration without sufficient study and deliberation,\" Ramirez says.  The previous Commission has been unabashed critical of the President.  But perhaps the most devasting of the body's tendencies--certainly for women and minorities--is its condemnation of affirmative action as adversely affecting whites.</span></p> <p><span>Contemporary affirmative action programs have long been based on looking back to the historical process of American institutionalized racism and sexism, which are known as \"problem-remedy\" solutions.  In 1981 the Civil Rights Commission defined affirmative action as \"active efforts that take race, sex, and national origin into account for the purpose of remedying discrimination.\"  The underlying rationale for affirmative action is that discrimination can be overcome only by an explicit consideration of an individual's background.  But such a system, charge critics of affirmative action, only constitute another form of racism or \"reverse discrimination.\"</span></p> <p><span>This indictment ignores two major points.  First, the impact of affirmative action programs, most initiated in the early '70s, is only beginning to be felt in this country's elite colleges and lucrative professions.  Although the past 20 years have witnessed the arrival of a Black Supreme Court Justice, Black mayors, and a Black astronaut, Black representation in the medical profession has only increased by a paltry half a percentage point since 1950.  White backlash in the face of such statistics seems unjustified.  Furthermore, a recently released study by the National Urban League confirms beliefs that whites and Blacks have not benefitted equally from the economy's ups and downs.  While Reagan takes credit for an overall decrease in unemployment to 11.2 percent, Black unemployment is at 17.8 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Pendictories to play down the significance of statistics:  \"Figures don't deny equally of opportunity, they deny equal results.\"  But Chairman Pendleton seems unwilling to accept connections between 200 years of systematic discrimination and institutionalized racism and current inequities between white and Black Americans Advocates of affirmative action do not deny the desirability of a \"color-blind,\" \"gender-neutral\" society, but, rather, realistically accept the limitations of our present society.</span></p> <p><span>The United States Commission on Civil Rights, as it is constituted now, is now moving toward the dismantling of federal protection of minority rights guaranteed by the Constitution.  As Ralph Ness, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights--a coalition of 160 minority groups--puts it.  \"Rather than having effective remedies to eliminate discrimination, we're going to move to \"remedies\" skin to separate but equal with this Commission.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Cultural Cop-Out | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>WITH THE BACKING</b> of the <i>New York Times</i> and the Washington Post, President Reagan gone ahead and notified the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisations (UNESCO) that the U.S. will pull out next year taking its $50-million annual contribution with it.  It's hard to withstand the flag-waving historic and the changes that UNESCO over-politicized, inefficient, and bloated.  But UNESCO is also the place where some crucial global issues allowed to be addressed outside of the Western industrial framework--and as it fades, those issues deserve a look.</span></p> <p><span>For conservative and liberals alike, the UNESCO pull-out discussions has by now reclared a good deal of built-up frustration with Third World Yanbre-go-home idelogies.  This leads to some rahter enjoyable rhetoric.  For example, Owen Harries of the Heritage Foundation says UNESCO</span></p> <p><span>seeks to downgrade individual human rights in favor of nebulous and proliferating \"rights of peoples,\" thus helping tyrannical states to impose their orthodoxies on their subjects.  Its pronouncements on the complex and delicate issues of peace and disarmament--subjects on which it is incompetent--are biased and hostile to the Western case.</span></p> <p><span>Are UNESCO's pronouncements \"incompetent\" because they are hostile to the West?  And wouldn't truly a unique \"Western case\" be inherently biased?  On the same <i>New York Times</i> opinion page a few days later in December, William Safire, who usually is known for a bit more intellectual and verbal adoptness, offers that UNESCO is a \"three star Paris restaurant masquerading as an international organization.\"  And, finally, a <i>Washington Post</i> editorial: UNESCO \"got hijacked by a Third World Communist collective seemingly interested less in running good programs than in engaging in ideological disputation and living the high life.\"</span></p> <p><span>OBVIOUSLY, one goal put forth for the pullout is to depoliticize UNESCO, to strip off its radical political edge.  Another is to reassert America's leadership in the organization and in the international community generally.  And a third is to force UNESCO crats to be more efficient with their money, which comes largely from the U.S. (we cast the lone \"no\" in the most recent budget vote at UNESCO).  But what his attracted more attention than all of these is the outery at UNESCO for the licensing and regulation of journalists.  The media here rightly criticizes any international government control of news.  Yet they forget that this proposal was first put forth to protect journalists in dangerous war situations and has never been called for in an official UNESCO resolution.  The fuss over licensing journalists has pushed underlying issues of communication into the background.</span></p> <p><span>In the early 70s, underdeveloped nations began to criticize the ideology of \"free flow\" of information that has flourished since WWN.  Instead of \"free flow,\" they complained of a one-way flow from the center countries to the underdeveloped nations, and urged to \"free and balanced flow\"--a slight modification only.</span></p> <p><span>Such criticisms sound awfully familar and the licensing controversy could serve as a blueprint for many others.  \"Free flow\" is the classic liberal ideology, the legitimizer of social theory, democratic constitutions, and neoclassical economics.  The most striking intellectual break with this ideology was Marx, who saw a one-way flow of surplus labor from laborers to capitalists.  The old liberal ideology has faced severe strains over recent decades in America, becoming the target for dissatisfied Blacks, women, gays, radicals, and others.  All of them said basically that the flow is one-way.  The lines of money, education, social goods have run from \"us\" to \"them.\"  Is it any wonder then that the free flow legitimization, the traffic of ideas, the freedom of choice of the worker, the \"natural\" exchange of the genders of economic labor for housework, were so strongly assaulted?  And with this in mind, is it any wonder why the country has titled to the right?  (Think of a giant pinball machine, tilting to one side and shutting off.)</span></p> <p><span>AS UNDERDEVELOPED NATIONS increasingly criticize our miding principles, we have not responded as a progressive Kennedy might have, negotiating to find some sort of common ground.  Instead, the nation has held its conservative Reagan pose, denouncing any proposals for change and putting up a rigid defense.</span></p> <p><span>The underdeveloped nations are calling for a New International Information Order (NIIO); to solve some basic problems.  One is news imperialism; Brazilians often read about Brazil in UPI or AP service stories.  Another problem is the stereotyping of the Third World in the Western media.  And a third problem, whosxe catchword is Western cultural imperialism, is the world mindest that creates an cettt, and makes scores of poor children in Israel wear \"Starsky and Hutch\" t-shirts.</span></p> <p><span>The neoclassical economist might point to the market, saying that people in the underdeveloped nations obviously want to read about Farrah Fawcett, Both why should they (or anyone, for that matter) want to? And one gets into a discussion of inferior psychological self-images in underdeveloped countries fostered by \"Western news imperialism.\"  There is also an economic aspect underdeveloped nations depend on Western satellites for communication and on computers in Western countries to manipulate duta which is sent out of the country and then back in (much as the English shipped cotton to Manchester, and manufactured cloth back to India).  But ultimately, the prospects for a NHO may depend on the reorganization of the world's wealth and resources--a New International Economic Order--which also is being called for by some Third World nations.  Meanwhile, rather than negotiate, the U.S. adopts rigid stances and lets isolation build.</span></p> <p><span>UNESCO was created as a place far from the narrow political bickering of the U.N., an agency through which mankind's highest ideals--education, culture, pure knowledge--were to find expression and development.  Instead though, we have found that all culture is political--not just domestically, where feminists have pointed it out, but internationally as well, anywhere where power is unequal.  UNESCO probably is blasted and inefficient.  But why not try to reform it from within, as France and Germany urge us to do?  Jesse Jackson notes that Reagan feels we cannot reform UNESCO from within, but holds the opposite view on South Africa.</span></p> <p><span>Deep down, a major U.S. motivation for pulling out of UNESCO is simply to regain its leadership.  Because we contribute 25 percent of the budget, but have only one vote among the nations of the world, Reagan is obviously trying to buy the way to leadership.  That, as has become apparent, cannot be done from within.</span></p> <p><span>It seems ridiculous and self-flagellating for the U.S. to remain in a anti-Western body and foot a large portion of its bills.  Yet the issue is not so clear as the Reaganites paint it; considerable moral and practical wrong can be attributed to all the players.</span></p> <p><span>The U.S. advisory commission on UNESCO, composed of private citizens, voted 41 to 8 to stay in, and \"copping out\" was the label applied by one former chairman of that Board.  They realize that to withdraw here is to highlight America's distance from the rest of the world--friends, enemies, and in-betweens alike--on the great and not-so-great issues of the day.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Civil Wrongs | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>SINCE ITS INCEPTION in 1957, the United States Commission on Civil Rights has been an outspoken monitor of federal civil rights policy and agencies.  Until Ronald Reagan stepped into the picture, its activities were characterized by fierce independence from partisan congressional and executive pressure alike.  Reagan first challenged historical precedent in 1981 when he replaced then-chairman Fleming with present chairman of the Commission Clarence A. Pendleton.  Then, in October 1983, he tried to fire three commissioners who opposed his position on civil rights.  The Commission had weathered six Presidents before Reagan became the first to fire a commissioner.  Today's agency is composed of four Reagan appointees and four congressional appointees, two of whom support the Administration.  Such a body can act as little more than a mouthpiece for Reagan in an election year.</span></p> <p><span>The purported watchdog agency demonstrated its change in approach at the new group's first meeting last week.  In sharp contrast to previous Commissions' vigorous support for affirmative action and desegregation, Reagan's Commission voted 6-2 against the use of numerical goals as a method of redressing past discrimination and against the use of busing as the last alternative to segregation.  It also made its \"top priority\" a proposed study of the effects of affirmative action programs on Americans of Eastern and Southern European descent.  More disturbing than these actions' political content, though, is the way the group simply parroted the Administration's position--without long deliberations or the independent research its staff of 250 is supposed to provide.</span></p> <p><span>One commissioner described the frightening pattern of last week's actions this way:  \"First they moved to protect Reagan from any criticism and then they rushed to support his policies without study.\"  Pendleton makes no bones about the Commission's alignment with the President:  \"The new commissioners are independent thinkers who happen to have ideologies compatible with the Administration's.\"</span></p> <p><span>But the new political, partisan nature of the civil rights group cannot be attributed solely to coincidence.  Reagan has sabotaged the Commission's purpose to study allegations of civil rights violations and to evaluate federal responses to such violations.  Congress should continue its record of improvement in civil rights (which has included the strengthening of the Voting Rights Act and the passage of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday) by clarifying the Civil Rights Commission's purpose and restoring its independence.  And that means wresting the power to appoint any commissioners at all from a President who has not used that power in good faith.</span></p>"}

They may be over but you do not like to hear them...it is not always pleasant to nice ears to hear a man ever coming with his dark facts and unpleasant conditions.  Nevertheless it is the highest optimism to bring forward the dark side of any human picture.  When a man does this he says to the world:  \"Things are had but it is worth-while to let the world know that things are bad in order that they may be become better.\"</i> <i>--W.E.B. DuBois, Class of 1890</i></span></p> <p><span><b>A</b> PERSON getting his head beat in while others stand by watching, soon stops pretending to believe that these are just innocent by standers.  He realizes, in fact, that they are hardly innocent, and in a very real sense, are actively helping the ones who are carrying out the actual assault.  As someone once put it, those who aren't part of the solution are part of the problem.</span></p> <p><span>Here we are in America, 1984, and it seems that only by a powerful act of deliberate self-delusion could one imagine that Blacks in America and elsewhere, are not, as a group, getting beat in the head by various American institutions, chief among them the United States government.  This is only one of many more dark facts and unpleasant observations that need to be brought to light.  Given the gravity of the situation and the dogged determination of so many to deny or belittle the truth, the only remaining task is to make sure that no one can hide behind the excuse of ignorance and say they didn't know what was being done to Blacks from Detroit to South Africa.</span></p> <p><span>Police brutality against Blacks in America is a continuing legacy of what, until recently, was perhaps the most grotesque aspect of Black life in America:  the fact that one's life could at any time be snuffled out at the whim of a white police officer, or some terrorist from the Klan, or a bunch of people who might, just for the hell of it, decide to decorate their trees and telephone poles with Black bodies.  This went on everywhere, not just in the South.</span></p> <p><span>And yet, in 1984, you can pick up a paper and regularly--just about twice a month--read about a new case in which a Black community has begun protesting that, once again, a white cop has killed an unarmed Black, often a child.  Moreover, justice system which in theory should be working to stop such killings is embarked on adventures of its own.  Hence the case of Lennell Geter, a Black engineer sentenced to life in prison for robbing a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant of $600--despite Geter's lack of any criminal record.</span></p> <p><span>Geter was saved by the efforts of his co-workers and, crucially, by the airing of the case on the CBS show 60 minutes.  The authorities in Texas, clearly put on the spot by the national attention called to the Geter case, released him and promise to drop all charges and reverse the conviction if he passes a simple lie-detector test.  At least one TV reporter has implied that this face-saving effort proves that \"the system works.\"  In fact, the opposite is true, unless \"the system\" of justice includes the opportune intervention of TV editors.  Others in Geter's position may not be so fortunate.</span></p> <p><span>Attention should also be called to the current attacks by the government on affirmative action programs designed to remedy and redress past wrongs.  Affirmative action is not a new idea.  Reparations were paid after the World Wars, and lawsuits brought against asbestos manufacturers 20 years after the original crime of exposing workers to the risk of cancer--these cases of redress are recognized as valid.  Similarly, the idea of redressing 400 years of terror, brutality and economic discrimination against Blacks was gaining currency until just recently.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>ut Today, the entire concept of affirmative action is under attack, usually by Reagan administration officials who claim to the vitally interested in casting that \"past discrimination must not be remedied by creating new injustice\" against whites.  They confuse setting up goals and timetables with filling quotas, presumably preferring that Blacks simply lodge individual lawsuits each time they find themselves victims of racial discriminations.</span></p> <p><span>The absurdity of such a position is obvious.  If Blacks had the resources to sue individually every racist in America, there probably wouldn't be much of a problem in the first place (although in such a \"sue-'em-all scenario,\" the courts would undoubtedly become over-crowded to the point of collapse).  Less amusing is the fact that \"merit\" is usually trumpeted as the supreme good which affirmative action undermines, while in reality, anyone can name a thousand and one instances in which factors other than merit were taken into acount in, for example, getting a job.  There are too many people who get jobs through parents, friends, \"old-boy\" networks, or the workings of a political patronage system.  Each example belies the notion that affirmative action tampers with cherished, purely \"meritocratic\" ideals.  At Harvard, students and admissions officers have openly admitted that it helps one's admissions chances to be the child of an alumnus.  But none of this is considered dangerous, or unjust.  Affirmative action, which is based on the principle of redress, gets singled out for a special, vicious attack.</span></p> <p><span>Racists and other anti affirmative action people will be pleased to note that, even with a decade or so of those programs now being excoriated, only a tiny dent has been made in traditional injustices.  For all the talk about the evils of affirmative action on the college level, it is rarely mentioned that one source, <i>Education Week,</i> estimates that half of all Blacks in college are actually in two-year institutions.  (The National Center for Education Statistics puts the estimate at 38 percent.)  A study of Los Angles Junior Colleges has shown that only 1 in 20 graduates of such two-year community colleges transfers to a four-year college upon completing their programs--indeed, most never even get degrees from community colleges.</span></p> <p><span>A whopping 4.5 percent of all law students Black, and American medical schools have been flooded with Blacks, who make up 5.8 percent of all doctors-to-be (this is a decrease from 7.5 percent in 1975).  Out in the real world, affirmative action foes should rest assured that Blacks make up only three percent of all doctors, although perhaps even this is too much for some people.</span></p> <p><span>In other news, the <i>Boston Globe</i> recently reported that the gap between Black and white infant mortality rates has widened, with the rate for Blacks lingering at the level found in many underdeveloped countries.  This has a great deal to do with malnutrition and poverty, which the government is hell-bent on increasing by cutting back Food Stamps and other programs.  On the question of unemployment, National Public Radio, like many other media outlets, a couple of weeks ago echoed the latest self-congratulations of the government, chirping happily about the \"good economic news\" that unemployment dropped slightly.  A little later, they noted parenthetically that joblessness in fact increased among Blacks, although this did not seem to detract much attention from the overall \"good news.\"</span></p> <p><span>That's some of the bad news.  Many people who hear it will still just mentally say \"Oh well, the Blacks are still catching hell\" and go have a nice day.  They are not the people who should be appealed to in the first place, but part of the problem that must be dealt with.  Unfortunately, the ones I should be addressing, the Black Americans themselves, are a little harder to reach.  An estimated 44 percent of us are functionally illiterate.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Reshaping Mondale | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>\"A</b> VOTE FOR anyone but Mondale is a vote for Reagan,\" has become a frequent rallying cry among Democrats this year, a cry which has played no small role in boosting the former Vice-president to his current front-runner status.  But if Mondale's success is to be lasting, it must hinge upon more than common opposition to the current Administration.  Unfortunately, Mondale has by and large turned a deaf ear on the constituency that could help him most--the rejuvenated Democratic alliance.</span></p> <p><span>Four years ago the general election seemed the same old game of choice between a ridiculous absolute and a laughable mediocrity.  One felt that one's best comment was no comment at all, to vote for John Anderson was to cry boredom at the whole political system, and indeed the country itself cried boredom.  Twenty-five percent of the country went of the polls in 1980, and Ronald Reagan's much touted \"mandate\" was a laughable eighth of the country.  But in a sense, Ronald Reagan may be the best thing that's happened to American politics since the depression.</span></p> <p><span>Four years ago, Black political power seemed out to lunch, women were entrenched in the difficulties of ERA.  This year, however, both women and Blacks promise to be an effective vocal and voting force in the election--particularly.  Blacks who now boast mayors in a large number of major U.S. cities.  Four years ago Reaganites harnessed religious and monetary fundamentalists, the former of whom had never really had a hand in American politics and the latter of whom had been in disarray since the days of President Coolidge.  But this year a new group of fundamentalists promises to have an important hand in opposing Reagan.  That is, a new constituency of democratically minded citizens who, one hopes, will nay say Reagan's flagrant disregard for the spirit of the welfare state and the rights of free speech in America.</span></p> <p><span>Even with a large slate of Democratic candidates however it remains unclear who if anyone best embodies the true values of the Democratic Party.</span></p> <p><span><b>H</b>OWEVER RISKY IT may seem, it is important not only to beat Ronald Reagan this year, but also to defeat the Democratic dead-letter, to make sure that the Democratic candidate for president represents what the country needs and demands.  When a CBS/New York Times poll last week showed Rowans critical and/worried about the president's economic and foreign policies, it became clear that, in addition to Black and female anger, there was also a widespread undercurrent of doubt about the president's success.  This, then, is emphatically not a year for liberals to turn inside themselves and assume that there is nothing they can do or say that will effect that great sleeping giant, the American electorate.  There are demands out there that need to be focused and the center of that focus, it seems, ought to be Walter Mondale.</span></p> <p><span>Currently Mondale is a morass of promises and, as he appeared in a recent cartoon, seems deliriously wrapped up in the dance of making them.  He seems neither a man with a vision nor a man with clearly delineated ideas, but some of his colleagues are.  Not Mr. Glenn, indeed, who seems bent on arguing with the former vice-president about past records, but the other six.  Many joke that these contenders are fighting for the pointless position of second place, but that position is anything but pointless in a primary.  Coming in first is only important on election day; before that date, all candidates have a chance to shape the issues of the campaign.</span></p> <p><span>The onus on Mondale this year is to make concessions to the formidable plans of his colleagues:  he must satisfy the demands of the Black and the poor that Jackson represents; he must answer to the demands for nuclear control that his colleague Senator Cranston is demanding; and he must turn his attention to the budgetary statements of Hollings.  Hollings has interpreted the long term strategy of Reagan's deficits as nothing less than the deliberate crippling of the Welfare state.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, Mondale must do more than listen to the demands of the much touted gender and minority gaps; he must select either a Black or a female running-mate.  Only by paying attention to these demands will Mondale rally a populist coalition.  If he succeeds, it will be an alliance with history and established legitimacy much stronger than any of the religious and hard-right minorities that elected the present president in the apathetic year of 1980.</span></p> <p><span>That is why it is important to cast a vote for a candidate with ideas in the upcoming primary.  When McGovern cut short a shouting match between Mondale and Glenn about each other's past records in a recent New Hampshire debate, demanding that those candidates cease arguing about each other and start arguing about the issues, he did so correctly.  With the support he has, Mondale seems destined to win in July, but he will be a longshot in November if he does not learn from the reinvigorated Democratic coalition.</span></p> <p><span><b>B</b>UT IT SEEMS clear, given Mondale's recent attacks on the Reagan administration that he will stick to the easy marks:  the policies of the Republicans and the blusterings of his colleague the astronaut.  That is why a vote for Jackson, a vote for Hollings, Cranston or even Hart or McGovern, not to mention Askew, is a vote that matters in the long run.  Mondale must fight for his own electorate in order to beat.  The Great Communicator, for at the moment, a vote for Mondale still seems a vote for Carter.  And both because it will not beat Reagan and because of the legacy of the Democratic doldrums, that is a very dangerous vote.</span></p>"}

A History of Liberalism in the 1960s</i> By Allen Matusow $42 pages, $22.95, Harper &amp; Row</span></p> <p><span><b>E</b>VINEROMTHI vantage point of 1984, the 1960s hardly seem a part of history.  The troubled decade that marked the rise of liberalism is far more vivid in today's political and cultural imagination than is, say, the decade that marked Eisenhower's ascendancy.</span></p> <p><span>In general, politicians in 1984 define themselves by their support or opposition to the government policies of the '60s.  And the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan, a man who had been too conservative even for the Republican Party in 1968, was heralded as the emergence of a modern conservatism in response to the liberalism of the '60s.  Republican presidential candidates since 1932 had, in effect, all been running against Franklin D. Roosevelt '04 Reagan revitalized the party by running against John I. Kennedy '40, Lyndon B. Johnson, and the programs that constituted the Great Society.</span></p> <p><span>So in 1984, policies nearly a generation old are fiercely contested political issues, and, as a result, one might expect any account of the Great Society to be resolutely partisan.  But that is exactly the obstacle which Allen Matusow overcomes so impressively in his history of liberalism in the '60s.</span></p> <p><span>This gracefully written and thoroughly researched book reads very much like a tragedy.  It is the tale of well-intentioned progressives whose attempts at real reform foundered because of their own ignorance of economic realities, the limits of conventional political action, and the challenge from radical movements strengthened, ironically, by the hesistant reform.</span></p> <p><span>Matusow is a liberal, perhaps a disillusioned one.  He believes that economic inequality in the face of tremendous prosperity results in a less than great society an assumption that will, no doubt, irritate many conservatives.  But he goes far beyond the widespread and simple view that the Great Society faltered and eventually disintegrated because of the increasing economic drain of the Vietnam war.  The war's effects, both economic and social, cannot be discounted, but Matusow emerges from the partisan fog to reveal the contradictions and tensions within the Great Society programs.</span></p> <p><span>John Kennedy's portrayal here is far different from the general tone of last year's tributes.  In the move towards liberalism in the Democratic party, Kennedy was actually more of a cautious follower than the courageous leader his media image implied.  With the liberal intellectuals who dominated the party in 1959, in fact, Kennedy was on shaky ground.  The young senator had, as a congressman in 1949, claimed that pro-Communists were directing America's Far Eastern policy.  He was referring to liberal scholars at a number of universities, including Harvard Liberal intellectuals were further reputed by the affection the entire Kennedy family had shown for Senator Joe McCarthy.</span></p> <p><span>But Kennedy was of course, a brilliant politician and media manipulator.  And he knew that he needed the support of liberal intellectuals, the core of the party, if he were to become president.  So Kennedy curried the favor of academies like Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. '38 and John Kenneth Galbraith; their activist, anti-Communist stance began to weave its way into his campaing speeches.  Kennedy gambled by casting himself as the civil rights candidate.  With Lyndon Johnson as his running mate--to reassure Southern white voters--Kennedy slipped by in November with a plurality of 118.550 votes.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy's 1000 days in office would be a halting struggle to implement liberal ideas.  Kennedy would not take the lead he had promised on Civil Rights, for he feared his Black-white coalition in the South would descend into turmoil.  But finally, when turmoil did erupt, he would be forced to take action, it had become politically acceptable to advocate slow social change in the South.</span></p> <p><span>Under the influence of economists like Galbraith and Paul Samuelson '38, Kennedy, who was an \"economic illiterate,\" came to accept and advocate Keynesian ideas of deficit spending and increased government control of the economy.  In a contentious dispute with the steel industry in 1962, Kennedy come to the conclusion that businessmen were \"sons of Bitches\" and that he was going to implement Keynesian tax policies, which he figured would stimulate growth, \"whether or not business thought it was good.\"</span></p> <p><span>It was ironic, Matusow writes, \"that the administration begun by John F. Kennedy should have become the sponsor of liberal reform...for he was transparently a conventional politician of conservative inclination.  But Kennedy was also a politician keenly sensitive to shifts in the political climate, and that climate altered perceptibly during his years in the White House.  Diminishing obsession with the Cold War permitted intellectuals to look critically, at their own country once again.  The era's affluence spawned both social optimism and the revenues to pay for modest new welfare measures.  The civil rights movement touched the nation's conscience and illuminated the squalid underside of American life.</span></p> <p><span><b>A</b>LTHOUGH MATUSOW does not specifically address the point, Kennedy's experience reflected both the limitations and the strengths of liberalism in the period.  The attempt at reform was genuine, but the execution was conventional and doomed to failure Kennedy's most idealistic programs, shepherded through Congress by Lyndon Johnson in the mid-'60s, couldn't overcome the status quo.</span></p> <p><span>Medicare and Medicaid, for instance, only placed public funds in the pockets of health care professionals and did not appreciably raise the quality of medicine for the poor and the elderly.  Urban renewal, as it turned out, did not eliminate slums.  \"It only relocated them.\"</span></p> <p><span>The problems were caused not only be entrenched interests which stood to lose in the new programs, but also by the lack of political clout wielded by the poor whom the programs intended to aid.  Matusow describes one program, designed by a maverick friend of Robert F. Kennedy '48, David Hackett, which emphasized community control of development and political action.  It was the one program in the Great Society that could be deemed radical:  \"Other Great Society programs sought reform by appeasing institutions; community action would seek to reform institutions by empowering the poor.\"</span></p> <p><span>Matusow's description of this program's ultimate failure provides a telling critique of the idealistic and perhaps unrealistic hope some had placed in the federal government.</span></p> <p><span>Matusow recounts the decline of the Great Society through poor management and escalation of the Vietnam ment and the escalation of the Vietnam count of the counterculture which grew in the late '60s.  He sees fundamental flaws there as well.  Students for a Democratic Socity, the Yippies, the Black Panthers--all went through periods of romance with Third World revolutionism, and then turned to guerilla tactics, reinforcing their isolation from the American mainstream.</span></p> <p><span>Nothing seemed to symbolize the disarray and divisiveness more than the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968.  Bloody battles erupted in the streets between brutal police and young radicals, and the party nominated Hubert Humphrey, who privately was a critic of the war but who remained the public heir to Johnson's policies.</span></p> <p><span>Liberalism had entered the '60s with soaring hopes and unbridled confidence; but its policies had only led to the \"unraveling\" of America.  What went wrong?  This question is still open to debate.  In Matusow's view, economists who misjudged the effect of higher taxes are partially to blame:</span></p> <p><span>By inducing less work and less investment, more drastic income redistribution would result in less economic growth.  Less growth would mean fewer jobs and a slower rise in living standards, important to poor people above all.  It was indeed a hard world when redistribution, which alone could reduce the extent of poverty, might in the long run hurt the poor.</span></p> <p><span>And this dilemma was compounded by the establishment's successful attempt to thwart the empowerment of the poor.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HESE PROBLEMS are still with us.  The income gap between Blacks and whites is the same as it was 20 years ago.  Integration, especially in the North, is still a troublesome issue.  This illuminating book has much to say about why liberalism failed and America turned to Ronald Reagan.  But the old problematic questions remain, and unhappily, answers and solutions still seem distant.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Back to Basics | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE TELEVISION MOVIE <i>The Day After</i> took a little more than five minutes to deal with the clash of troops, tanks, and tactical nuclear weapons in a European conflict.  For the other two-hours and 55 minutess (including commercials), 70 million Americans viewed Kansas both before and after a general thermonuclear attack.  You may recall the scenario:  political upheaval in East Germany; Warsaw Pact siege of West Berlin; attack of NATO tank forces to relieve the beleaguered city; counterattack; NATO use of small nuclear weapons against an overwhelming Pact advance; holocaust.</span></p> <p><span>The producers of the film deserve at least come credit for building their story on a plausible series of events.  They can also hardly be blamed for relegating the truly important questions of our nuclear age to brief snatches of radio broadcasts.  The film merely mirrored the current misplaced emphasis of the Western press and some of the American people concerning the overall superpower balance and the suspended talks in Geneva and Vienna.</span></p> <p><span>Modern military forces can be broken down into three broad categories-strategic nuclear weapons tactical nukes, and conventional forces.  Appropriately enough, East/West talks on each type have been held on and off for the past 13 or 14 years.  SALT, begun in the early '70's with the start of detente, became START under the Reagan Administration.  Its subject has been ICBMs, SLBMs (Submarine Launched Balistic Missiles), and intercontinental bombers.  The INF (intermediate Nuclear Force) negotiations deal with the so-called \"Euromissiles.\"  These nuclear devices--the Pershing.  If ballistic missile, the Tomahawk cruise missile, and the Soviet SS-20-fit somewhat awkwardly into the \"tactical\" category.  They are capable of striking all of Europe, including European Russia in a matter of minutes.  Thus they are not, in any traditional sense, \"tactical\" weapons, but rather use intended to destroy European heartlands.</span></p> <p><span>The third set of talks, held in Vienna instead of Geneva are the MFBR (Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction) talks.  As the name partially implies, these talks have been aimed at limiting non-nuclear-forces-in Europe to reduce tension, which the West believes stems from an estimated 3 to 1 Eastern advantage in overall conventional strength.</span></p> <p><span>It is interesting to compare each of these talks-albeit suspended--to the sequence of events in <i>The Day After.</i>  Considering the staggering amount of overkill capacity possessed by both superpowers, it can safely be concluded that no conceivable START agreement could have saved Lawrence, Kansas.  The INF negotiations are even more peripheral to the story's outcome.  The airburst weapons used in the movie were either bombs or rockets launched from planes, ground-launched short-range rockets, or artillery-launched weapons.  Both sides possess thousands of these small devices, and they have never been the subject of bilateral negotiation.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>NSTEAD, it is the MBFR talks that become quite interesting in the framework of <i>The Day After.</i>  The first two premises of the movie were an East German revolution and a siege of West Berlin.  Such events cannot be ruled but; witness Poland's recent unrest and the troubles over Berlin since 1945.  Oppressed people-have-a habit of rising against their oppressors, as the heirs of the October Revolution are certainly acutely aware.  To this end, the Pact and the Red Army, not SS-20s or SS-18s, guarantee Soviet security through political repression.  And this is what MBFR is all about.</span></p> <p><span>In Soviet eyes the possession of a 2 to 1 advantage in manpower and a 4 to 1 advantage in armor over NATO is necessary to ensure the subjugation of its satellites.  The Soviets have denied these figures, but reliable Western intelligence-gathering has confirmed them time and again.  Other sticking point in the MBFR--the West's desire to talk about superpower reductions first vs. the East's desire to consider all forces together, and the Soviet's continued resistance to on-site inspections-reflect their deep-seated mistrust of the West.</span></p> <p><span>In general, conventional forces logically lie at the root of the European security question.  After all, troops and tanks have been there essentially unchanged in number, if not in sophistication, since 1945.  Small, tactical nukes came later, and were integrated more or less haphazardly into each side's standing battle plan.  Intercontinental missiles came later still.  The strategic arms race has essentially been a battle of politics and prestige.  The questions behind nuclear weapons are really ones of cost, domestic politics and proliferation.  Neither defense establishment seriously fears a general thermonuclear attack started by accident or even by design.  In fact, aside from the specter of European conventional clash after political revolution, the only real worries considered by each side are proliferation-a nuclear was started by a non superpower-or perhaps a non-nuclear superpower clash over some other area (the Persian Gulf, Cuba, etc.) escalating to a holocaust.</span></p> <p><span>As far as Europe is concerned then, we are left with MBFR.  It is by far the least-publicized, and even the least-lamented of the three talks.  It is highly telling that, of the three, it is the only one which presently looks as if it will resume.  At the European security conference held in Stockholm two weeks ago, the Soviet delegation dropped hints that these talks could resume by mid-March, it would appear that the Soviet Union attaches more self-interest to these conventional talks.</span></p> <p><span>This should not be surprising.  The only truly successful arms talk in post-War history was the Limited Test Ban Treaty, negotiated by the Kennedy Administration.  It was clearly in the Soviet interest to stop nuclear contamination of its own atmosphere.  It was also easily verifiable.</span></p> <p><span>It's time for the Western press and people to realize that dealings with the Soviet Union must be premised on mutual self-interest and verifiability.  It is not in the Soviet interest to limit development of strategic weapons.  SALT I utterly failed, as the Soviets showed with the largest (and ostensibly secret) nuclear buildup in history during the '70s.  It is also apparently not in their interest to limit Euromissiles.  The INF negotiations never had a chance, since the Soviets see their interest in holding a monopoly of these weapons as a political tool over both Western and Eastern Europe.  They even have begun forward deployment of SS-20s-in East Germany.  However, the failure of these talks is only dangerous if the West loses its nerve as a result and weakens deterrence.</span></p> <p><span>By contrast, conventional arms reduction talks have at least a grain of hope, and hold more practical importance than the Geneva talks.  The main reason for this is that troops and tanks are far larger drains on the superpower economies than nuclear weapons, and are not nearly as desirable from a technology or prestige point of view.  By limiting the ability of the East to predict conventional victory, and the West to expect defeat, a success here would take away any incentive for Soviet attack, or for Western use of nukes in \"self-defense\" against an attack, Vienna, not Geneva, may prove the best defense of Lawrence, Kansas.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Don't Count Bombs, Stop Them | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>N</b>UCLEAR FREEZE.  It's something that you can get excited about.  It's a <i>cause celebre,</i> a handy catch phrase that covers a wide range of anti-war sentiments, from pacifism to middle-of-the-road pragmatism.  Yet, the wholehearted embrace of the nuclear freeze issue-with the idealistic \"unilateral\" or the cautioning \"bilateral\"-has resulted in the rover simplification of an issue that defies vague sloganeering.</span></p> <p><span>Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass) will run a possibly successful campaign for senator this year, focusing on the nuclear freeze issue.  And seven of the eight presidential contenders-former Florida Gov. Reubin O. Askew being the exception-have endorsed some sort of freeze.  Unsuccessful 1972 Democratic nominee George S. McGovern has gone so far as to call for a unilateral halt to nuclear arms production and deployment.</span></p> <p><span>Yet as enthusiasm grows, the less likely it becomes that any of the would be Democratic party holders will seriously examine the merits of the freeze idea.  The nuclear issue had received only cursory consideration from within the Democratic camp precisely because a consensus has been reached so quickly.  But, for the Democrats to present a realistic alternative to the Reagan militarism, they must develop a realistic proposal to bring the arms race under control and lessen the likelihood of Armageddon.</span></p> <p><span>Such proposals have been floating through intellectual circles and appearing in the political journals for some time, and one, the No First Use plan, is worthy of serious consideration by party policy makers.</span></p> <p><span><b>N</b>O FIRST USE, a concept that finds its roots in the Baruch Plan of 1946, has received renewed consideration in the wake of a 1982 article in Foreign Affairs by four former top-ranking military planners, McGeorge Bundy, national security advisor to President John F. Kennedy '40; George F. Kennan, former ambassador to the Soviet Union; Robert S. McNamera, secretary of defense under Kennedy and President Lyndon B. Johnson; and Gerard Smith, chief Salt I negotiator.</span></p> <p><span>In a nutshell their argument is as follows:</span></p> <p><span>*Stop the escalation of warfare at the border between conventional warfare and nuclear warfare of any kind.  There is no such thing as \"limited\" nuclear war, meaning that any use of nukes would probably lead to an all-out exchange.  Respond to Soviet aggression in kind and do not attempt to save a conventional defeat with nuclear weapons.</span></p> <p><span>*Maintain our nuclear forces at such a level and deploy them in such a way that the Soviet Union could not safely undertake a first strike of its own.  Do not drop the nuclear guarantee-made at the formation of NATO after World War II-that the U.S. would respond to a Soviet first strike on Western Europe with a nuclear second strike.</span></p> <p><span>*Cancel deployment or scrap weapons intended primarily for a counterforce-targeted against military installation and silos.  If we do not intend to conduct a first strike, counterforce targeting would, logically, become unnecessary, since a second strike on Soviet silos would probably fall on empty holes.</span></p> <p><span>*Step up the U.S. conventional military presence in Western Europe and West Germany, in particular, to compensate for the deterrent effect of nuclear weapons.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE PROPOSAL ELICITED a flurry of response from military planners and civilian observers, including a quick \"no way\" from the Secretary of Defense Alexander M. Haig.  Though McNamera, in particular, has been trying to keep the issue alive, it has faltered from lack of attention from the Administration and, surprisingly, from the opposition Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>The reason is, of course, that even talk of loosening the U.S.'s nuclear ties to Western Europe could have disastrous consequences for the Alliance.  Yet, by the same token, it should be argued that a continuation of our less and less credible nuclear umbrella would, in the long run, have similarly divisive effects.</span></p> <p><span>Though debate now focuses on the relative numbers of the NATO and Warsaw Pact nuclear arsenals, the fragile promise that binds the Alliance should and inevitably will have to be considered.  And now is a good time for the Democrats to bring such discussion into the political mainstream.  Moreover, with the President unable to bring the Soviet back to the INF and Strategic Arms negotiating tables.  No First Use proponents can present a particularly timely arguments.</span></p> <p><span>Not only would a U.S. declaration of a No First Use policy, combined with a real change in our nuclear deployment, be a public relation coup, but it would also break the deadlock in the arms talks since, with a conventional defense, the numbers of warheads becomes less important.  In this sense, No Firs Use is a much more profound move towards peace than a nuclear freeze which leaves policy matters largely untouched.  No First Use allows the United States to move beyond a freeze, removing both the need for counterforce first strike missiles and the justifications for attempting to match the Soviets bang for bang.</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>or the more hawkish American and Europeans, No First Use offers the promise of increased conventional military strength, though critics of the proposal correctly point out that a conventional build-up will be extremely costly and unpopular.  However, any increased reliance on conventional rather than nuclear weapons lessens the danger of Armageddon, and that should be worth the financial burden.</span></p> <p><span>No First Use is, admittedly, a major shift from a policy that has remained in place throughout the nuclear age.  But it is imperative, at this low point in U.S.-Soviet relations, for the Democrats to move debate beyond the largely cosmetic issue of numbers toward the real weak point of both the Reagan administration and NATO-policy.</span></p>"}

But wait until election day and you'll sec quite a different scenario-people from ages 18 to 24 vote less frequently, and follow races less closely, than any other American demographic group.  What is more, young Americans are now avoiding the polls in unprecedented numbers, earning them the moniker \"the silent group.\"</span></p> <p><span>Young people represent roughly 20 percent of the nations's eligible voters, potentially a powerful voting bloc.  Butut as yet their force has remained untapped--of the 28 million college students eligible to cast ballots in the last Presidential election, half did not register, and a substantial number of those registered did not vote.  Almost 60 percent of American non-voters are under 25 years old.</span></p> <p><span>Why have young people, characteristically energetic and concerned in other areas, forfeited their political power?  Part of the explanation lies in their age itself--as Assistant Professor of Government Ethel Klein Points out, voting is a \"habitual act,\" something you learn to do over time. The young are not politically initiated; often it takes two or three campaign exposures for them to get into the habit.</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, though young people are generally more educated than older generations, they are singularly uninformed on current events. Surveys have shown that college students rarely watch the TV news or regularly read daily newspapers. In fact, according to a recent ABC study, nearly 80 percent of 18 to 25 year olds could not name a single Democratic candidate for 1984.</span></p> <p><span>But their record of non-voting cannot be attributed solely to limited information, or political inexperience. Young people are less interested because they feel the impact of the federal government less directly-they pay no property taxes, send no children to public schools, and are largely unemployed. Young voters are more mobile than any other citizen groups, so their roots in their local communities do not run as deep as those of their counterparts over age 30 Less subject to government pressure in all areas, students traditionally have had little personal interest in selecting their next leaders.</span></p> <p><span>Increasingly, however, students' direct interests are at stake. The Reagan Administrators has made a virtual policy out of hitting on groups with limited clout, with the announcement this week of wholesale cuts in educational aid for 1985, and the President's reiteration of the support of tying aid to draft registration, the attack on student interests has intensified. In 1980 financial aid to students was saved from the chopping block by the opposition of prominent Democratic lenders--but students today cannot afford to rely solely on a fortuitous coalition of congressional representatives. Today, like never before, students must lobby-with their minds and with their votes--to hold the hard-word advantages they secured years ago.</span></p> <p><span>In the long run, young people must be made to understand, as minorities and women are realizing today, the extent of their power.  As 20 percent of the voting public, they form a powerful interest group with the clout to make great changes in policy.  With a heightened sense of solidarity and political activism the might oven help away close elections.  President Reagan's margin in some states in 1980 was ordinated involvement of the young would have had a powerful impact.</span></p> <p><span>But this is only if we can reverse the more fundamental obstacle to student participation: the growing sense of disenfranchisement and indifference among America's most potentially energetic citizens. The issues of the '60s and '70s raconflict, Victnam, and Watergate--loosened party ties and turned new voters against the political process itself, they led to a wholesale rejection of government, and to the feeling that cial voting was no longer a viable way of influencing the direct of federal policy. Their apathy is not because of ignorance but because of despair.  \"Students today feel very alienated from the traditional political system,\" says Beth Pardo of the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group (MassPIRG) \"They see themselves not as citizens but as students, so they don't have to fulfill their civic responsibilities.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>NE WAY of trying to activate dormant student power is by increasing the visibility of registration drives, targetting campus populations for special attention. Such effort are underway today--in the local area, the Institute of Politics is hosting a \"registration fair\" next Tuesday, and MassPIRG is sponsoring its own registration symposium for Boston-area students next weekend.</span></p> <p><span>It is difficult to tell how effective these drives will be so far, students have proven a difficult group to register In 1972, the League of Women Voters launched a national drive targeted at campuses across the nation, with little success Bur the media attention, and the attention from the candidates themselves, that these efforts will draw may help to get young people more excited about flexing political muscle--and that might just start the ball rolling towards greater participation Even if it is too late to recapture that trust of the last generation, there may still be time to involve the next one--and to ensure that the \"silent group\" finds a political voice</span></p>"}

But the other candidates, all of whose percentage points in the polls do not add up to Mondale's, were each given roughly equal space-except for McGovern.

{"title": "Bring on the Veto | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>F</b>EW ADMINISTRATION officials have acted more consistently to show the ugliest features of Reaganism than White House counselor Edwin Meese III.  It was Meese who recently raised anew the Reagan government's callousness and insensitivity, when he questioned concern over hunger in the country, and implied that many people in soup lines were really not impoverished.  It was Meese who led the Administrations push for tax exemptions for colleges that racially discriminate.  And it was Meese who has worked actively to enact the President's notorious directive of March 11, 1983, which seeks to create what is essentially a lifetime censorship system for more than 100,000 top government officials who have access to classified information.  Certainly, if there is a \"thoughtful\" side to Reagan's rock ribbed conservatism, Ed Meese hasn't done much to highlight it.</span></p> <p><span>And now Reagan wants to make Meese Attorney General, supposedly the country's foremost proponent of the rule of law and justice.  That role has been sliding into obsolescence under the stewardship of William French Smith, the Californian crony of Reagan's who served as Meese's Justice Department accomplice in his tax-credit government secrecy seams.  It seems destined for the dustbin, if Reagan gets his way on appointing the at table-but highly ideological ex California D A as Smith's successor.</span></p> <p><span>The rejection of a Presidential nominee to a Cabinet or Cabinet level post has historically been a rate thing, and well it should.  The President has a general right to have his own people fill his senior positions.  But when that right gets bastardized by the appointment of someone who lacks all qualification for his jobs-a la a Kenneth Adelman or a William Clark-or of someone who has demonstrated an avowed antagonism to the principles he is supposed to serve-a la a James Watt and now Edwin Meese-the Republic is diminished.  And Congress must step in to prevent it.</span></p> <p><span>The story of Cabinet appointments in the first three years of Reagan is a sorry one indeed.  Following the perfectly reasonable rule of giving the President his men.  Congress has been steam rolled into acquiescing in the creation of one of the least distinguished Cabinets in history, one fraught with incompetence and a degree of corruption that would have seen previous Presidents run out of office.</span></p> <p><span>To his credit, Ed Meese's name has not been linked to the sort of sordid activity associated with colleagues like Ann Burford, James Watt, Paul Thayer, Rita Lavelle, Charles Wick, or Ray Donovan.  Nor can he be derailed for his stands on issues like busing or affirmative action; while we disagree with his opposition to these principles, they are not enough to reject his nomination.  Yet Meese's role in many White House actions suggest an ideological rightist view of the law that goes beyond principled conservatism.  Not only did Meese push tax exemptions for racist schools and Reagan's secrecy campaign, he also did all he could to gut the independence of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, to cut off legal aid for the poor, and to go as far as to call the American Civil Liberates Union a \"criminal's lobby.\"</span></p> <p><span>It seems almost ironic to call for the rejection of Meese as Attorney General.  His removal from the White House represents the final routing of the hardline conservatives from Reagan's inner circle, and in that sense we welcome the move.  But his appointment as Attorney General would only serve to hasten the further demise of the once-great office.  Can Congress do anything other than reject this man's nomination-resoundingly?</span></p>"}

{"title": "Aff. Action | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>To the Editor:</b></span></p> <p><span>Errol T. Louis, in his recent editorial piece \"The Darker Side,\" has certainly moderated his anti-American vituperation from the levels reached in some of the articles of his which appeared last year in What Is To Be Done?  This time, in an admirable display of self-restraint, he limits himself to the charge that Blacks in this country and elsewhere are \"as a group, getting beat in the head by various American institutions, chief among them the United States government.\"  Louis is, of course, being figurative; we Blacks have not been in serious danger of random head-beating for some time, and Louis's use of this analogy in fact belies our tremendous progress since the time when people might, \"just for the hell of it, decide to decorate their trees and telephone poles with Black bodies.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, Louis does list what he believes are some concrete examples of current oppression.  I would like to concentrate on an example he cites of the federal government's involvement in this oppression:  the Reagan Administration's \"attack\" on affirmative action programs.  If this policy is the best Louis can muster to support his assertion that the federal government is the chief oppressor of Black people, then I think we can safely conclude that, in this case as in so many others, Louis's appeals offer more to the emotions than the intellect.</span></p> <p><span>Reagan's opposition to affirmative action, or, more properly, reverse discrimination, is based on the serious moral questions which any policy of favoring one racial group over another must raise in a liberal society.  To his credit, Louis does acknowledge these questions, in that he spends several paragraphs discussing some of them.  But in the end he fails to be convincing.</span></p> <p><span>Louis's first claim about reverse discrimination is that it is \"designed to remedy and redress past wrongs.\"  The validity of other cases of redress is not questioned, he asserts, yet \"affirmative action, which is based on the principle of redress, gets singled out for a special, vicious attack.\"  Among such cases of redress he cites lawsuits brought against asbestos manufacturers 20 years after the original exposure to the workers.  But in fact, his case points up the important deficiency in Louis's argument.  The plaintiffs accuse the asbestos companies of being directly responsible for harming those who were exposed.  Those who favor reverse discrimination, however, would require many whites to bear the burden of redressing the wrongs of their great-grandfathers.  And the ancestors of other whites (for example recent immigrants) took no part in the subjugation of Blacks, removing even that tenuous link to guilt, yet reverse discrimination punishes them just the same.</span></p> <p><span>The second point about reverse discrimination Louis makes is that those who insist that remedies for past discrimination not injure the rights of whites confuse the \"setting up [of] goals and timetables with quotas, presumably preferring that Blacks simply lodge individual lawsuits each time they find themselves victims of racial discrimination.\"  In this assertion, Louis is using the \"straw man\" technique in double measure.  First, no serious participant in the debate objects to increased efforts to recruit more minority applicants.  Goals and timetables are acceptable, and even laudable, as long as no applicant's credentials are given special weight because of his or her race.  In the event special weight is given, goals and timetables do indeed become indistinguishable from quotas.  Second, neither do serious critics of reverse discrimination assert that the bringing of lawsuits by individual Blacks who are victims of discrimination is a complete solution to the problem.  Nevertheless, an important principle of liberal society is that social utility--and no one denies the desirability of establishing racial equality--is not a sufficient ground for violating people's rights.</span></p> <p><span>Louis's final contention on reverse discrimination is that \"'merit' is usually trumpeted as the supreme good which affirmative action undermines, while in reality, anyone can name a thousand and one instances in which factors other than merit were taken into account in, for example, getting a job.\"  First of all, the fact that many employers often consider criteria unrelated to the performance of the job is no invitation to require the addition of racial status to that list.  Second, what is especially odious about reverse discrimination is not that it is just another example of an employer considering \"factors other than merit\" according to his or her personal preference, but that it includes a government effort to standardize those perferences in a particular way.</span></p> <p><span>Those of us who ardently desire a racially equal society are naturally tempted into calling for radical means to bring about that end as quickly as possible.  Nevertheless, some of us don't succumb, because we know that the rights which are violated today for a good cause may be violated tomorrow for a bad one.  The safest course is never to violate them at all. <b>James A. Cox '84</b></span></p>"}
{"title": "Fruit of the Tainted Tree | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>E</b>THYLENE dibromide (EDB) is not a household word, but Duncan Hines, Betty Crocker and Wonder Bread are.  So when government officials recently discovered significant levels of the pesticide, a potent carcinogen, in a host of grain and cereal products, a warning cry went out.  In the wake of these discoveries, and the public furor that followed, William Ruckelshaus, director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), last week suspended the use of the chemical on grain products.</span></p> <p><span>Ruckelshaus' move appeared dramatic, but, in fact, the action was long overdue.  Scientists have long believed that the chemical, used primarily as a fumigant after the grain has been harvested, causes cancer and birth defects in laboratory animals, even in minute quantities.  Industry spokesmen and EPA officials have often argued that there is no firm evidence linking the chemical to cancer in humans, but longterm studies have shown EDB to be carcinogenic in rats and mice.  For the time being, consumers everywhere are the unwitting guinea pigs who will demonstrate the pesticide's effect on human health.</span></p> <p><span>EPA first began to look closely at the chemical in 1977, and by 1980 had proposed to cancel all food-related use (EDB is also added to gasoline to prevent lead deposits in engines).  But then came the change in administrations and, with strong chemical industry lobbying against any restrictions, no action was taken under now-infamous EPA administrator Anne Burford Last September, Ruckelshaus cancelled use of EDB as a soil fumigant, but only after significant amounts of residues of the chemical showed up in the ground water in several states.  The current order extends the ban to use on grain after harvesting, but is by no means conclusive; citrus products, also often treated with EDB, are unaffected by the new decree.</span></p> <p><span>And despite the headlines, Ruckelshaus' restrictions on EDB use have done relatively little to counter the still more widespread threat which the use and overuse of pesticides in America poses.  When he presented the recent order, the EPA administrator reassured the press that the country is not facing a \"public health emergency:\"  yet such a crisis may be just around the corner.  EDB is only one of scores of pesticides in use across the country that are suspected of threatening human health, and are showing up in food and water supplies in many states.</span></p> <p><span>Over one billion pounds of pesticides were used in this country last year.  An overwhelming number of these chemicals have not been sufficiently tested to evaluate their health threat.  For example, around 80 percent of the pesticide products now sold have not been tested for their ability to cause cancer, and in the case of over 60 percent of them, it is not known if they cause birth defects.  In the 1970s, in one Kentucky county, the occurrence of a certain form of cancer quadrupled in the years after a new pesticide was put into use in the area.</span></p> <p><span>In large part, this crisis of truly unknown danger is the long-term result of the lax requirements of the little-known Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the law which governs the registration and use of pesticides.  Dating from the 1940s, FIFRA has allowed many chemicals to be widely used despite a lack of information about their health effects.  In recent years, its provisions have been strengthened, and pesticides introduced now do have to undergo thorough testing.  A process of re-registration, carrying out and verifying new tests for chemicals approved under old standards, was also loosely mandated by the newer provisions of FIFRA, but the EPA has been slow to tackle this task.  In 1972, Congress directed the agency to complete the re-registration process by 1976, but EPA then obtained extensions to 1977, 1978, and finally the removal of any set deadline.  By the middle of last year, the EPA had a complete and comprehensive set of tests for only 47 of the 605 major active pesticide ingredients now in use.</span></p> <p><span>In a sense, it is appropriate that the discoveries about the extensive presence of EDB in our food supply have surfaced recently, since far-reaching and badly needed amendments to FIFRA are now before both houses of Congress.  These amendments would prohibit the application of pesticides which are still not fully tested for their threat to human health.  This would bring a halt to the present EPA practice of allowing untested chemicals to be used while the studies are being carried out.  In addition, the amendments would stop the granting of special \"emergency use\" permits for the use of pesticides which are known to be deadly--a practice which has skyrocketed during the Reagan Administration.  And the proposed changes to FIFRA would direct special attention toward the threat of pesticides which contaminate food or groundwater.  These amendments would help the EPA avoid more problems like the recent discovery of EDB-tainted cake mix and bread.</span></p> <p><span>Not surprisingly, the organized and powerful chemical companies are lobbying hard against any tightening of the restrictions on the sale and use of their products.  In the past, they have supported a weakening of the FIFRA requirements, and the companies have resumed that push this year.  Positive change in an election year is always difficult, but Congress should have the courage to pass these needed amendments to the law governing the use of so many toxic chemicals.</span></p> <p><span>At present, the bill's chances are not good unless Ruckelshaus throws his weight behind the measure now before Congress.  Ruckelshaus has already compromised his office by avoiding any ruling on the use of EDB on citrus products--largely because of the potential effect on international trade--although residues of the chemical at 25 times the international limit considered safe for humans have been found in the pulp of fruits from Florida.  In light of his sworn duties to protect the environment and human life, strong support of the Congressional measures should be foremost on Ruckelshaus' agenda.</span></p>"}

Others say Jackson made the remarks while bantering with <i>Washington Post</i> reporter Milton Coleman and one other journalist, possibly from <i>The New York Times.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>*February 13:</b> <i>The Post's</i> Rick Atkinson publishes Jackson's remarks in that day's paper, with Coleman given reportorial credit at the end of the article.</span></p> <p><span><b>*February 19:</b>  Jackson tells Lesley Stahl on CBS News' <i>Face the Nation</i> he did not make the remarks.  \"It simply is not true, and I think that the accuser ought to come forth,\" Jackson says.</span></p> <p><span><b>*February 19:</b>  Jackson calls Benjamin C. Bradlee, executive editor of <i>The Post,</i> and sets up a meeting with <i>Post</i> reporters and editors two days later to discuss the publication of the remarks, according to <i>The Boston Globe.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>*February 21:</b>  During Jackson's meeting with <i>The Post, The Globe</i> reports, the Presidential candidate says he has \"no recollection\" of having said either \"hymie\" or \"hymietown.\"  When told CBS's Stahl is Jewish, Jackson reportedly says.  \"She doesn't look like she's Jewish.  She doesn't sound like she's Jewish.\"  Jackson also reportedly asks Bradlee.  \"Do you know that Freeman Gosden was Jewish?\"  referring to one of the creators of the largely racist mid-century radio show, <i>Amos and Andy.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>*February 23:</b>  At a nationally televised debate between all eight Democratic contenders at New Hampshire's St. Anselm's College, moderator Barbara Walters confronts Jackson about the remarks, telling him he has the chance to clear the air.  A nervous Jackson again says he has \"no recollection,\" repeating three times within one minute, \"I am not anti-Semitic.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>*February 24:</b>  Jackson tells reporters, \"I won't deny, nor on any level admit it,\" adding that what he just said \"constitutes a denial.\"  Jackson complains about \"media fascination\" with remarks made a month ago.</span></p> <p><span><b>*February 25:</b>  Jackson flies to Chicago to attend a Nation of Islam meeting.  Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan, referring to the \"hymie\" incident, warns Jackson's opponents.  \"If you harm this brother, I warn you in the name of Allah, this will be the last one you harm.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>*February 26:</b>  A month and a day after his Washington Airport conversation, Jackson tells a packed Manchester synagogue, \"Press reports were circulating brewing up a storm about the word 'hymie.'\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I was deeply disturbed.  I watched as the words spread into paragraphs and then into chapters,\" he adds.  \"I was shocked and astonished as the press' interest in this ethnic characterization made in private conversation but apparently overheard by a reporter.\"</span></p> <p><span>Asking to be forgiven and \"accepted in the Lord's house,\" Jackson goes on the offensive, accusing some Jewish groups of staging an \"organized effort to destroy this campaign.\"</span></p> <p><span>Jackson cites a history of racially motivated insults directed his way, including his daughter's admissions interview for Harvard three years ago.  In a <i>Crimson</i> interview.  Jackson charges Chicago attorney Stephen B. Cohen '61 with \"harassment\" of Santita Jackson because of her father's 1979 meeting with Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yassir Arafat.</span></p> <p><span><b>*February 27:</b>  Jackson defends Farrakhan's remarks in Chicago, telling <i>The Times,</i> \"Jews went to the chambers silently.  They should have gone fighting if they had to go at all.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>OR TWO WEEKS Jackson, the self-proclaimed \"moral conscience\" of the Democratic Party, engaged in double talk and even lied about having made a racial slur against Jews.  In the process, Jackson turned what should have been an irrelevant incident into a full scale rhetorical war between America's Blacks and Jews.</span></p> <p><span>Even in the aftermath of his dramatic Manchester confession, Jackson has demonstrated that his \"hymie\" reference was not just a random off-color remark, but evidence of a deep lack of understanding about the politics of the \"Rainbow Coalition.\"  The Jews never went to the gas chambers silently; throughout history the Jews, a persecuted minority since the days of Moses, have fought adversity and rose to prominence on their own terms.  And like Blacks, Jews still face irrational hatred in America.  But since last summer, when Jackson first started preaching about the Rainbow Coalition in earnest, he has excluded the Jews from that group.</span></p> <p><span>Even when begging forgiveness in the Arath Yeshuran temple.  Jackson refused to do the same.  Drawing seemingly vast conclusions from the virulent anti-Jackson demonstrations led by fringe groups such as \"Jews against Jackson,\" the candidate implied he is the victim of Jewish persecution.  Jackson told the packed hall that after his 1979 visit with Arafat, he did not \"feel welcome\" among American Jews.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE WIDENING GAP between Blacks and Jews is no surprise.  Since the '60s, when the two groups worked together on the cutting edge of the civil rights movement in the South.  Jews have gradually moved rightward.  During the '70s, the Jewish lobby came out against affirmative action programs and quotas, and more and more American Jews joined the Republican ranks.  Five percent more Jews--though not a majority--voted for President Reagan in 1980 than did for Gerald R. Ford in 1976, while 5 percent less Blacks voted for the Californian.</span></p> <p><span>In the last five years, Black leaders, led by Jackson, have moved to support the beleaguered PLO and the outlaw with a heart of gold--Arafat.  Jackson's outspoken support for the PLO prompted Nathan Perlmutter, director of the Jewish Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, to publish the now infamous 19-page critique of Jackson's politics, distributed widely to Jewish opinion-makers.  Perlmutter and others have harped on remarks, attributed to Jackson, that he is tired of hearing about the Holocaust and equating the PLO and Israel, Jackson now denies the former, and calls the latter out of context.</span></p> <p><span>The most outspoken Jewish media, especially <i>Commentary</i> and the once-liberal <i>New Republic,</i> have sounded alarmist tones about Jackson's trip to Syria to release downed Navy pilot Lt. Robert O. Goodman Jr., and a $200,000 contribution by Arab groups to Jackson's Chicago-based public service group, People United to Save Humanity.</span></p> <p><span>Jackson is not the only prominent politician to speak strongly against recent Jewish policies, especially the 1981 invasion of Lebanon and the resulting Shatilla massacre.  Candidate George S. McGovern has taken a political line similar to Jackson's, though he has couched his rhetoric in friendly terms.  McGovern, before the same Manchester audience that heard Jackson, said he criticized Israel as a \"friend,\" not as an adversary.</span></p> <p><span>But there is a blurry line between political and social disagreements and that line is made all the more hazy by inflammatory rhetoric from either side.  That Jackson cannot clearly articulate a pro-Arab platform--which is and should be perfectly acceptable--without also directing cries of \"racism at American Jews, shows that he is not the moral leader he professes to be.</span></p> <p><span>Were Jackson as magnanimous as he expects others to be, he would not stoop to the level of \"Jews against Jackson\" or <i>Commentary's</i> rabid Norman Podhoretz.  He would not bluster for two weeks about being \"bounded by members of the Jewish community\" or complain about press persecution.  As one who is the victim of many such off-color remarks, he should understand how and why people are insulted.</span></p> <p><span>Apparently, he doesn't.  While calling for a move to a \"higher moral plane,\" he provokes extremists such as Farrakhan and Meier Kahane and further damages any possibility of meaningful reconciliation.  And by neglecting to hold all to the same moral standard, he damages his own credibility, turning calls for reconciliation into self-serving hypocrisy.</span></p> <p><span><b>U</b>LTIMATELY, the only reaction is sadness.  Jackson is not conspiring to destroy Israel; it is doubtful that he wants to or will ever have the power to do so.  All Jews are not plotting up different ways to waylay the Jackson effort.  But in the heat of the moment, no one has stood back to assess the damage the incident has caused.</span></p> <p><span>If Jackson cannot raise himself from the mire, one hopes others will, and have the foresight to understand the reality behind the rhetoric of minority coalition politics.  A failure to do so bodes ill for both the Black and Jewish causes.</span></p>"}

Studds (D-Mass.) visited this small resort town of about 8000 to hold one of his frequent \"town meetings\" on issues and concerns of his constituents just two weeks after his censure for a 1973 affair with a male Congressional page.</span></p> <p><span>What Studds found was a community violently divided over his sexual misconduct and homosexuality.</span></p> <p><span><b>Manhood</b></span></p> <p><span>At the meeting, a Dennis selectman presented Studds with a petition signed by 314 residents calling for his immediate resignation because he had \"de-based his manhood\" and could no longer effectively represent the 10th district.  Demonstrators with picket signs reading \"Get the Gay Out\" and \"Dump Studds\" also greeted the 46-year-old Congressman.</span></p> <p><span>But about half of the crowd registered equally vigorous support for Studds, including a former page who pleaded that the crowd consider Studds's record and dedication.</span></p> <p><span>Six months later, tempers have cooled, but, as Studds begins his fifth reelection campaign, his 10th Massachusetts Congressional district remains clearly divided in its feelings about Studds as a man; and, to a lesser extent, Studds as its congressman.</span></p> <p><span><b>Three Sections</b></span></p> <p><span>The district includes three distinct sections:  the traditionally Democratic blue-collar New Bedford area, which still depends on commercial fishing for much of its livelihood; the more conservative and more elderly constituency on Cape Cod; and the affluent liberal suburbs to the southeast of Boston.</span></p> <p><span>Studds's strong record of service to the area over the last 10 years has made him extremely popular throughout his district, Studds is particularly strong in New Bedford, where fishermen associate him with helping institute in 1974 the 200-mile-limit on U.S. waters, which kept foreign boats out of the fishing zones off the Cape.</span></p> <p><span>Studds has also worked hard to keep oil drilling rigs off Georges Bank, winning him support from Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard residents.</span></p> <p><span><b>Angelic</b></span></p> <p><span>\"Until this scandal broke this summer, you'd think he was an angel from heaven, the way people talked about him,\" says David Morris, who works at The Peanut Store, a confectionery market in downtown New Bedford.  \"I've heard a lot of fishermen say they like what he's done for them.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think he's done a good job as far as helping the seamen around here.  I don't see anything wrong with him,\" agrees a secretary at a Christian Science reading room in New Bedford.</span></p> <p><span>Besides fishing and martime issues--Studds served as chairman of the House subcommittee on the Coast Guard and navigation until he was stripped of his seniority after the censure--Studds has been an outspoken critic of the Reagan Administration's military policy in Central America.</span></p> <p><span>But by and large, the 150,000 voters of the 10th district are divided over how they feel about Studds as a person, although not necessarily as a representative.</span></p> <p><span><b>District Divided</b></span></p> <p><span>An intellectual who is not well-disposed toward the nitty-gritty of politicking.  Studds comes across to his constituents as either smart and capable or aloof and arrogant.</span></p> <p><span><b>Strong Shoulders</b></span></p> <p><span>\"He has a good head on his shoulders.  He's a very smart person,\" says 28-year-old Pamela Moniz, a saleswoman at New Bedford Shade and Drapery.</span></p> <p><span>But Elaine Fisher, a Barnstable house-wife in her 60s, says she \"didn't vote for him before and I'm not going to now.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"It's because of his preferences for one thing, but I didn't know that before,\" she says.  \"I just don't like him--I think he's arrogant, and he makes himself sound better than he really is.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Ultra-Liberal</b></span></p> <p><span>Dennis Selectman George W. Fallon says he hopes Studds will get voted out of office \"because he's an ultra-liberal--his record is one of extreme liberalism,\" and also because he disagrees with his lifestyle and his activities.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think that we citizens have a right to expect more,\" Fallon adds.</span></p> <p><span>James Gouvela, owner of Jimmie's Hot Dogs in New Bedford, also says he thinks Studds's record as a congressman has been very good.  But on the congressman's homosexuality, Gouvela adds, \"As a man, I can't buy that kind of stuff.  He seems to think it's an ultimate lifestyle, but I don't agree.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>The Competition</b></span></p> <p><span>Peter Flynn, the sheriff of Plymouth County, which includes the part of the 10th district running south from the suburbs to the Cape Cod Canal, has emerged as Studds's principal rival for his seat.</span></p> <p><span>Flynn, is also the first Democrat to challenge Studds since 1976, Studds ran unopposed in 1978, and faced no challenge from his own party in 1980 and 1982 when he beat Republican opponents by more than two-to-one margins.</span></p> <p><span>Flynn has avoided making political capital out of Studds's censure, but \"quite frankly, when you talk to people, that's the first thing that comes up,\" notes Flynn's campaign manager, Robert J. Glenn.</span></p> <p><span><b>The Issues</b></span></p> <p><span>The principal issues in the campaign will be transportation and the environment.  The quick completion of repairs on the Southeast Expressway, which connects the South Shore with Boston, heads the list of area concerns.  The presence of toxic PCBs in New Bedford Harbor and cuts in the Coast Guard budget have upset district residents and are major campaign issues.</span></p> <p><span>There is, however, very little disagreement among Flynn and Studds on these issues.</span></p> <p><span><b>Retains Popularity</b></span></p> <p><span>Richard Kendall, the Democratic Party's Falmouth town chairman, says he feels Studds \"retains great popularity\" despite the censure.  \"I'm convinced that he will have a very strong showing in the Falmouth area and throughout the district.\"</span></p> <p><span>Studds swept every single town and city in the district in the past two elections, according to Kendall, and he feels an anti-Republican sentiment in the area will work in Studd's favor.</span></p> <p><span><b>Old News</b></span></p> <p><span>\"I think people have made up their minds months ago on the [censure] situation,\" says Studds aide Peter N.

{"title": "Presidential Doublespeak | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>N 1946, before he became notorious for what he is notorious for today, George Orwell wrote an essay called \"Politics and the English Language,\" in which he stated the following:</span></p> <p><span>Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the English language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that we cannot by conscious action do anything about it:  Our civilization is decadent, and our language--so the argument runs--must inevitably share in the general collapse.  It follows that any struggle against the abuse of language is a sentimental archaism, like preferring candles to electric light or hansom cabs to aeroplanes.  Underneath this lies the half-conscious belief that language is a natural growth and not an instrument we shape for our own purposes.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the best example of Orwell's complaint lies in the public statements of our present Administration.  Besides the fact that our President may well be the most illiterate man in America today--have you ever noticed the amount of effort it takes to reconstruct his sentences--his government is disconcertingly inept at saying anything clearly.  But the dangerous truth behind Mr. Reagan's statements is not his careless sentences, but his careless thoughts.</span></p> <p><span>Take for example, one of our government's favorite nouns, the word \"this.\"  Never meant to be a noun and defined as an indefinite pronoun at best, the word \"this\" is used by the Administration to avoid naming anything they'd rather not discuss.  Reading the morning paper on the day after any press conference, one is sure to find the President commenting, \"I have nothing to say on this,\" or (when he is disposed to talk) \"Let me say this on that,\" if he is referring to something like Grenada, Lebanon, Nicaragua, or the Russians walking out of negotiations.</span></p> <p><span>Our Administration also has a peculiar talent for calling their plans and operations by the name which most effectively describes what they are not doing.  We have a \"peacekeeping\" force in Lebanon which does nothing but keep war, a national security directive intended to reduce national comprehension, and we sent a \"rescue mission\" to invade Grenada.  Of course these kinds of names have been used before--we have had a Secretary and Department of Defense waging war for a long time--but our present Administration has carried even this kind of misnomer to an extreme.  During the past year, the Environmental Protection Agency facilitated the dropping of industrial waste, and the Secretary of the Interior made strip-mining easier.</span></p> <p><span>Reading the morning paper, more often than not, offers further examples of the President's particular brand of language.  Last week, for example, the President defended the conduct of the chief of the United States Information Agency, Charles Wick:</span></p> <p><span>I don't think that Charles Wick is a dishonorable man in any way.  I can understand his forgetting sometimes when he was talking to people particularly that he knew, \"[Wick's taping] was different... [from someone]\" trying to keep a record on other people's conversations what he was actually trying to do was to immediately transcribe so that he could provide the suggestions that were being discussed to the people that would have to implement them...</span></p> <p><span>Now this quotation is pieced together, but if one remembers the facts of the matter it is embarrassing to figure out what the President is actually saying.  What, for example, does Reagan mean when he says. \"I don't think Charles Wick is a dishonorable man in any way?\"  If \"dishonorable\" means anything it means lying and Mr. Wick lied several times when he told reporters early in the investigation of his taping that he had never taped without permission.  The issue is not \"forgetting\"; one does not forget taping a conversation the way one forgets an address.  And finally, what is the difference between \"trying to keep a record on\" and \"immediately transcribing,\" if the tapes are still in existence?</span></p> <p><span>The fact of the matter is that the President is playing a down limp game with words.  He appeals to one's \"understanding,\" to distract the listener from what's going on; the attempt may or may not be conscious, but the result is the same.</span></p> <p><span>Orwell uses a quotation from Ecclesiastes to show the danger of modern English:</span></p> <p><span>I returned, and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</span></p> <p><span>which he translates into modern English as follows:</span></p> <p><span>Objective consideration of modern phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must be taken into account.</span></p> <p><span>With (I hope) as little insult to Mr. Orwell as possible, here it is at a Reagan news conference:</span></p> <p><span>Mr. President, who do you think is most likely to gain \tfrom your economic programs?</span></p> <p><span>Now let me just say this to that, Bob...and I think Mr. Meese was misheard on this before and I want this clear now... When I look at this great country, and let me say \tthat at least 98.5 percent of this country is great and that's a real figure. . . I feel that it is the interests of this country in a great democracy ...and what Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said is applicable here, that \"everyone should do their best in this\" ... that we will off work together towards our common goal of making America great and it's just going to take time, that's all'...next?</span></p> <p><span>Now this may sound absurd, but try reading any of the texts of the President's news conferences and imagining what he's really saying.  Then try looking around you and see how few people actually network on his language at all.</span></p> <p><span>Orwell notes in the same essay that the result of slovenly and misleading language is much like that of drink to an alcoholic:</span></p> <p><span>A man may take to drink, because he is a failure and fail all the more completely became he drinks.  It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language.  It becomes ugly or inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language \tmakes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.</span></p> <p><span><b>W</b>HEN WE HEAR the President speak, we are usually much disposed to accept what he is saying; we don't think twice about \"peace-keeping\" and about a \"national security directive,\" and forget to consider what such words really mean.  But if we remember for a second what we are really about, the business of electing decent Presidents, it should not be hard to get rid of this whiskey-semantic trance; carry a dictionary and a Constitution about when you listen to the President speak, and refer to them, not to your yearning for the frontier.  Then let us hope that in 1985, we can send all the thises, peacekeeping forces and randomly cited percentages back to California, where they belong.</span></p>"}

As a chronicle of the reign of the New Right, the book is as depressing as it is funny.</span></p> <p><span>\"As a young child,\" writes Stamaty of his hapless antihero, Congressman Bob Forehead, \"young Bobby had one ambition; to host a TV quiz show.\"  Instead, the wayward actor--who bears a less-than-coincidental resemblance to Rep. Jack Kemp (R.N.Y.)--becomes the political pawn of Gerard V. Oxboggle, president of Glominoid Corporation.  And as a conservative representative.  Forehead is the tool of every right-wing cause, from maniacal weapons manufacturers to preachy Southern Senator Clancy Fumes (a.k.a. Jesse Helms).  Fumes lives in righteous fear of \"secular humanist liberals\" and plots to replace the Supreme Court with a panel of the four TV evangelists with the top Neilsen ratings.</span></p> <p><span>But what is really funny here is that \"Washingtoon,\" as any good satire, is so true to life.  Like an audience watching a very good impersonator, we see the antics of everyday Washington, and the Administration's social Darwinism emerges:  Defense Department officials order a new bomb that \"will kill only those people who do not carry a credit card\"; the President announces a policy called \"The New Deferralism\":  \"that we, at the federal level, defer all responsibility for social problems for a period of eight years\"; and Reagan justifies high interest rates, explaining:  \"We just recently received word of a man who got a loan to buy a new automobile many years ago when interest rates were low.  Well, that man used that automobile as a getaway car in several armed robberies.  But I'm happy to say that our current high interest rates make automobiles unaffordable to a man in his income bracket.\"</span></p> <p><span>Stamaty's imitation of the kind of logic being tossed around Washington by right-wing bureaucrats for three years is hilarious in its proximity to reality.  It's hard to tell how much talent a humorist has, though, when he chooses such an easy target.  Stamaty gets his best lines without much more than quoting Presidential statements; in an address to the House.  Forehead says, \"The only way to get rid of our deficit is to cut taxes.  Only when government has no money will it stop spending.\"</span></p> <p><span>Garry Trudeau raised quite a furor a year ago when he announced that he would take a leave of absence from his daily comic strip \"Doonesbury.\"  In explaining his sabbatical, Trudeau mentioned something about his characters, children of the '60s, needing to grow up and move on.  \"Doonesbury,\" created in the paradigm of the radical '60s, just wasn't funny under the Reagan Administration.</span></p> <p><span>Trudeau was right, of course, and though \"Washingtoon\" will probably never make it to Broadway's floorboards, the strip is one of the few that ably captures the irony of a liberal perspective on Washington in the '80s.  One effort that comes close is James T. Pendergast's \"Mrs. Gipper,\" which began appearing on the letters page of Rolling Stone last year, and portrays the adventures of the First Lady, surrounded by a full entourage as she galavants through the capital city, stopping off to order fast food and advise husband Ronnie on the issues of the day.  Few other cartoonists have come close to turning the absurdity of Reagan Washington into something to laugh at without then crying.</span></p> <p><span>\"Cynicism,\" wrote H.G. Wells, \"is humour in ill-health.\"  By this scale, \"Washingtoon\"'s humor is on the brink of terminal cancer.  Like his colleagues at The Voice and every other American of liberal bent, Stamaty demonstrates that survival that which has become vital in America in the '80s; cynicism.</span></p> <p><span>It is the attitude spawned and fed by the kind of thinking.  Stamaty satirizes in \"Washingtoon\" when a Pentagon official testifying at a committee hearing says:  \"At present, Soviet defense spending causes 85 percent more damage to the Soviet economy than U.S. defense spending does to the U.S. economy.  The gap is unacceptable, it must be closed.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HOSE WHO hold fast to their ideals, who cannot but take themselves seriously, react to conservative Washington by kicking and screaming--by marching and writing and knocking their heads against walls.  But the New Right has done its greatest damage in the rest of liberal America.  It has stomped all over ideals and beliefs turning an army of believers into a generation of cynics.  And while there are those who still carry globes and organize proves the vast majority wants only to laugh.  A little humor never hurt anyone.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Reagan's Wing | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>S</b>OCIAL SCIENTISTS await the opening of Presidential libraries with excitement, because each one--even Gerald Ford's--organizes and unveils important documents and mementos previously kept from view.  But the hype surrounding the Ronald Wilson Reagan's collection promises to be unprecedented.  For although such museums typically include a President's private memoranda, it's hard to believe Reagan owns enough such documents to back the many assertions he has made with seeming disregard for fact.</span></p> <p><span>Though the actual groundbreaking is years away, preparation has already started.  The guidebook for this magical museum was published late last year.  <i>Ronald Reagan's Reign of Error,</i> by Mark Green (a former Nader Raider) and Gail MacColl (a veteran preppie parodist who worked on <i>The Preppie Handbook</i> and an L.L. Bean catalogue spoof), diligently tallies the seemingly endless stream of Reagan's assertions that only the \"Great Communicator\" himself has been able to substantiate.</span></p> <p><span>The book suggests ample funding sources for the Presidential library.  The deepest well of money could be the tremendous increases in government spending and taxes over the past two decades identified first, and solely, by Reagan.  He said early in his Presidency that \"in the last 10 years, federal spending has increased more than 300 percent,\" and that \"the percentage of your earnings the federal government took in taxes in 1960 has almost doubled.\"  But official government records show only a 200 percent spending increase (46.5 percent when adjusted for inflation) and a rise in the tax rate from 10 percent to only 12.5 percent for the periods in question.  In locating these missing revenues.  Reagan should have more than enough for the building and all its trappings.</span></p> <p><span>Since his early days on the mashed potatoes circuit, the amiable conservative has made big government the biggest but of his jokes.  So it is likely that the biggest, and most popular of the displays will be on regulation.  One whole wing will have to be devoted to the 19,000 businesses which, in 1962.  Reagan said had been nationalized by the federal government (No one has ever catalogued more than a few hundred).  Another very large room will reveal 15,000 General Motors employees, whom G.M. 'itself never knew existed, slaving away on federal paperwork.'  Posted across one wall will be the complete set of 44 OSHA regulations for climbing a ladder which Reagan alluded to in a 1978 speech.  Up until now, the agency has only published and enforced two.</span></p> <p><span>One area that has been buried under a slag heap of red tape has been the environment.  As part of his attempt to cut through this morass.  President Reagan has made available substantial portions of previously preserved lands for development.  To answer critics who complained of dwindling resources.  Reagan said last March that \"there is today in the United States as much forest as there was when Washington was at Valley Forge.\"  Though the U.S. Forest Service places the figure at about 30 percent, the back yard of the Reagan memorial will have the 500 million acres of trees previously thought cut down (Visitors, however, will be forced to don gas masks before entering because, as the Republican nominee said before the 1980 election, \"approximately 80 percent of our air pollution stems from hydrocarbons released by vegetation.\").</span></p> <p><span><b>F</b>OREIGN AFFAIRS is another area where the Californian has made a sharp break from the past, both in policy and in conventional wisdom.  In this portion of the museum, scholars will for the first time get a glimpse at valuable documentation showing that the United States actually owned the Panama Canal (contrary to the 1903 treaty) and that North and South Vietnam had been two separate countries for centuries (despite volumes of history books and years when both were ruled by the same government, excepting periods of Chinese and French colonization).  Bolstering the United States strategic forces is one of the major accomplishments of the Reagan Administration, and while the President has broken a lot of new ground in this field, the item likely to get the most attention will be the display case showing the submarine-launched missile that is recallable--a device the Pentagon is not yet aware of.</span></p> <p><span>Yet there is a limit to the size of the memorial, so tourists will not get a chance to see everything from Ronald Reagan's career.  Missing will be the interviews and speeches he gave throughout the '60s and '70s suggesting that Social Security no longer be compulsory (In 1966, he said, \"Social Security ought to be voluntary.\"  In 1980, he said, \"I never suggested that Social Security should be voluntary\").  Gone will be the suggestions that the United States re-establish diplomatic relations with Taiwan (\"I misstated\"), his endorsement of a unified Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty, and the campaign promise of a balanced budget (\"In the first place, I said that [a balanced budget] was our goal, not a promise.\").  And in the wake of the current furor over the President's special hunger commission and the presence of a widespread problem, it is unlikely that the archives will put out on display the text of a 1964 TV speech in which the retired actor said \"We were told four years ago that 17 million people went to bed hungry every night.  Well, that was probably true.  They were all on a diet.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>F REAGAN loses his reelection bid, it should in part be because millions of Americans, regardless of ideology or party, are embarrassed that their leader is so consistently stupid, misinformed, or dishonest.  The library will be built in 1985, and in front will be a statue of Abraham Lincoln engraved with the first Republican President's pertinent insight:  \"You can fool some of the people some of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time.\"  If, as most pundits predict, Reagan does win four more years, the memorial will not be erected until 1989.  And next to that bust of the Great Emancipator will be a marble likeness of the Great Communicator with his famous refutation below:  \"There you go again.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Playing With the Rules | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>W</b>HEN THE DEMOCRATS go to the polls next month to begin selecting their party's nominee for President, they'll be participating in a process unlike any they have seen before.</span></p> <p><span>Electoral reforms from 1970 to 1980 were a valiant attempt to make the system more representative than in the old days, when party acolytes deliberated in smoke-filled rooms--but the last two elections demonstrated that the system was still in need of ample tightening.  This year, the party has completely revamped its delegate selection process.  And the new system, which will be tested in the coming months, seems finally to be moving in the right direction.</span></p> <p><span>Spurred by the chaos and perceived inequality of the 1968 Democratic Convention, electoral reforms in the next 10 years significantly broadened representation among delegates, virtually eliminated elected officials from service as delegates, and vastly increased the number of primaries and the length of the selection process.  Though well intended, however, the proliferation of primaries, from 17 in 1968 to 36 in 1980, seemed to backfire badly, turning the nominating process into a veritable steeplechase that discouraged those with hefty official responsibilities from running and led to gross inconsistencies in state voting rules.</span></p> <p><span>In some states candidates were represented directly on the ballot, while elsewhere only delegates were listed; in some, primary voting was open to all state citizens, in others only to those with declared party affiliation.  Moreover, the arbitrary order of primary dates and the duration of the process gave disproportionate influence to small states with early contests, while large and populous states like California often found the race over by the time their turn came.</span></p> <p><span>But perhaps the most worrisome consequence of the reforms was their impact on voter turnout:  As the primary system grew longer and longer, popular participation steadily declined.  Some analysts, including former President Jimmy Carter, have argued that the drop in turnout is due mostly to more complex registration requirements--but registration has been made progressively easier in the last decade and voting hours have been extended.  Nor can the \"new apathy\" be adequately attributed to a lack of clear issue choices and difference between party candidates; 1980, the Presidential election with the lowest percentage turnout to date, was a case study in contrast between candidates with unambiguous policy stands.</span></p> <p><span>More likely, the dulling of voter interest and participation resulted directly from the endless stream of contests from January to June.  Unlike the national election in Britain, which lasts only three weeks and generates profound voter excitement, the current American system lulls potential voters to sleep.  If the World Series were to drag on for six months, interest in the outcome would probably wane, too.</span></p> <p><span>Faced with the obvious failure of the system in 1980, the Democratic Party in 1982 completely revamped their nominating process.  The Hunt Commission, chaired by Governor James B. Hunt of North Carolina, shortened the primary season to three months and restored the automatic right of knowledgeable state, party, and elected officials to be convention delegates in 1984.  Such a system promises to be less wearing to candidates and the public alike.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HESE PROVISIONS have drawn overwhelming support from Democrats, but another Hunt innovation has come under increasing attack--the \"winner-take-all\" system of apportioning delegates, which gives all delegates in an electoral district to the top votegetter rather than awarding them proportionately to several candidates.  The Rev. Jesse Jackson lambasts the rule as discriminating against minority voters--but what he fails to acknowledge is that studies show the winner-take-all provisions will also help his candidacy by awarding him all delegates in the nation's many districts which are predominantly minority.  In fact, the Hunt Commission, which included several prominent Black leaders, was the first of its kind to ensure adequate minority representation at the national convention.  It enacted a new provision requiring the body, previously dominated by white males, to reflect proportionally the percentage of minorities in the nation's population.</span></p> <p><span>What the rule <i>does</i> do is make it harder for trailing candidates to keep their campaigns alive.  It favors frontrunners, \"stacking the cards very much towards the established center and away from a wild-card candidate,\" as Jackson complains.  The party adopted this conservative stance for a reason--their highest priority, as the race heats up, is to select a candidate who has enough broad political support to challenge the Republican incumbent with some hope of success.  The Hunt Commission rules, in the end, may make the Democratic Convention less open to the views of party extremes--but they will also produce a candidate and an organization with the best chance of ousting Ronald Reagan from the Rose Garden.  And that, in the year 1984, is a goal that most Democrats should be able to agree on.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Out, Out | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>T IS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING that taping scandals did not ring a bell in President Reagan's mind, when he went to bat for Charles Wick last week.  As usual, though, the President showed surprisingly little grasp of the serious implications of a member of his staff.</span></p> <p><span>Charles Wick, director of the United States Information Agency, is guilty of several rather damning actions, few of them illegal but most of them certainly unethical.  First and perhaps most depressing from the man who runs the Voice of America.  Wick lied to <i>New York Times</i> reporter Jane Perlez and columnist William Safire when they questioned him about his taping activities.  Although Wick had been taping conversations for some time and may well have carried about a tape device for use when away from the office, he denied to Safire and Perlez that he had ever taped without the consent of the caller, and then later conceded that he sometimes forgot to get that consent.  The worst example of his failing memory seems to have been the day he allegedly took a pocket tape recorder to Florida and taped a phone call to Chief of Staff James Baker III without telling him.  Baker wasn't the only one to find that taping incident \"unethical\"; the district attorney of Palm Beach, where such taping may well be a felony, presently has the event under investigation.  Similarly displeased are two Congressional committees and the Federal Services Administration, who are also looking over Wick's taping activities.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, the only one who is not displeased by the USIA chief's conduct is the President, who last week called Wick \"honorable,\" and pledged to let him \"continue\" in his post.  Perhaps Wick's previous Wattian statement this summer that the reason Margaret Thatcher opposed the Grenada invasion was that she was a \"woman\" should have clued the President earlier on that another staff member was falling by the wayside.  Perhaps the USIA chief's alleged summer redecoration of his house with public funds should have alerted Mr. Reagan that Wick was spluttering.  Let us at least hope that the Congressional investigations prompt the President into appropriate action.  Nor should he just put Mr. Wick on the waiting list for Secretary of the Interior.  He should remove the Chief of the United States Information Agency from his post.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Den of Thieves | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>\"I</b> DON'T THINK anyone in their right mind believes that there is a massive hunger problem\" in America, says George C. Graham, professor of international health and pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University and the only doctor on Ronald Reagan's Task Force on Food Assistance.</span></p> <p><span>Graham, in an Associated Press story of December 29, 1983, went on to insist that, contrary to popular belief, Black children are \"probably the best nourished group in the United States.\"  The pediatrician cited as evidence the achievements of Black athletes.  Malnutrition exists in certain areas, he said, but hunger among children \"is not a national problem.\"</span></p> <p><span>One initial impassioned reaction to this might be that Graham, like so many other people in Washington, is a racist pig.  But surely this description is unfair to the barnyard swine, who, for all their disgusting habits, do not steal food from starving children and then lie to escape responsibility for the resulting sickness and death.  That has been the thrust of the Reagan Administration's policy, which Graham seems intent upon seeing continued.</span></p> <p><span>Some lies should not be lent even the scant legitimacy of refutation.  But in this case, it is important to realize what a vast falsehood has been advanced--and to recognize that the money taken from hungry children has, in effect, been transferred to the military.</span></p> <p><span>When Reagan appointed the hunger task force last August, he claimed to be \"deeply concerned about the extent to which we have a problem that should not exist in this great and wealthy country,\" and confessed to being \"perplexed by these accounts\" of hunger in America.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, the puzzled President needed to look no further than his 1982 and 1983 budgets.  A Washington-based foundation, the Children's Defense Fund, has analyzed the extent of the damage Reagan has wrought, in a 244-page study called <i>A Children's Defense Budget,</i> from which the following information is drawn.</span></p> <p><span>The Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) is a program that provides food supplements such as milk, eggs, juice, and iron-fortified infant formula to pregnant and nursing women, children and infants.  To receive WIC aid, the recipients must have low income and be certified by a medical professional to be in danger of illness from malnutrition.</span></p> <p><span>A Harvard School of Public Health study cited the WIC program as a measure that markedly reduced the incidents of low-birth-weight babies.  A separate study by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health found that infant mortality rates were one-third lower among WIC children when compared to infants in similar circumstances that were not getting assistance.  When Reagan took office, there were 2.3 million people being served by WIC, with tens of thousands more languishing on waiting lists or turned away because there wasn't enough money to help them.  The Administration's first blow at the program was a 1981 proposal to cut WIC by 30 percent.  Congress, which the Children's Defense Fund says considers WIC \"one of the most effective programs run by the federal government,\" rejected the Reagan cut.</span></p> <p><span>Undaunted, the Administration bypassed Congress and encouraged some states to cut their WIC programs.  This resulted in 200,000 people being removed from the program in fiscal 1981--while $60 million in WIC money remained unspent.  Congress ordered the Reagan Administration to reinstate the removed women, infants and children, and to serve as many people as possible.  But by August of 1982, five states had run out of funds, while 25 states had unused money.  By law, the Department of Agriculture must shift funds to needed areas, but it refused to do so.  After a federal judge ruled that the Administration's refusal was illegal, the 200,000 people were placed back in the program, and funds were used to prevent program cutbacks in the five states.</span></p> <p><span>Congress and the courts stopped the Administration from gutting the WIC program, but yet another effort was made:  the 1984 budget proposal kept WIC funding at the same level as the year before--$1.09 billion--with no increase for inflation.  As food prices go up, an estimated 115,000 people could be dropped from the program.  There are about the same member of WIC recipients now as when Reagan took office.</span></p> <p><span><b>I</b>N SHORT, the federal program most successfully alleviating hunger, sickness and death among infants and young children has been subjected to an unrelenting and at times illegal attack by the Reagan Administration.  Other hunger programs have proved less resilient:  food stamps have already been cut $2 billion, and the Administration is calling for cuts of $3 billion more in coming years.  Some 875,000 people have been cut from the food stamp program.</span></p> <p><span>And hunger, of course, <i>is</i> a national problem, particularly among Black children (one half of whom live in poverty).  Dr. Graham contended publicly that Black infant mortality rates are high not because of hunger, but for \"cultural\" reasons, including a refusal by expecting parents to abstain from sex.  Gynecologist Patricia Conrad of New York speedily refuted Graham's statement, pointing out that sex during pregnancy is safe up until the eighth month--provided the mother is not malnourished.</span></p> <p><span>What next?  In light of Reagan's bafflement about the existence of a national problem he has done so much to exacerbate, it seems likely that he will accept the fabrications of unreconstructed racists like George Graham.  Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, says the Hunger Task Force is about to propose as much as $1 billion in cuts in food assistance over the next few years.</span></p> <p><span>The Children's Defense Fund has proposed that food programs for children be preserved and expanded, and that a closer budget-cutting eye be turned on the Pentagon.  Here are some of the Fund's calculations about the Department of Defense:</span></p> <p><span>* Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger '38's private dining hall at the Pentagon costs taxpayers $400,000 a year; it could be made to run on a self-sufficiency basis.</span></p> <p><span>* Every year, $2 million goes for 24-hour-a-day emergency \"Redline\" phones, which always have operators on duty.  The phones have been used for calls to everything from hobby shops and dog kennels to restaurants, banks, hairdressers and hunting clubs.  The price of the phones equals what it would cost to give breakfast to 2 million poor children.</span></p> <p><span>* The cost of the carpeted reviewing stand at Parris Island's Marine recruit depot could have provided mid-morning food supplements to 83,000 low-income children in child care centers.</span></p> <p><span>* Planes for military stunt flyers--the Air Force's \"Thunderbirds\" and the Navy's Blue Angels--cost taxpayers over $200 million, with tens of millions more spent each year on the program.  This is about twice as much as Reagan says he wants to save from cuts in school lunches and breakfasts.</span></p> <p><span><b>T</b>HE FIGURES are remarkable.  You couldn't in a thousand years dream up such a system, where starving infants are denied food while, for example, 21 new battle cruisers--at a cost of $1.05 billion each--are built.  It is a systemic problem.  On December 20, 1983, Sen. William V. Roth Jr. (R-Del.) was on the <i>CBS Evening News,</i> pointing out some of the military's worst excesses.  Roth decorated a Christmas tree with $100 in odds and ends, for which the Pentagon--with its \"cost-plus\" method of insuring that all contractors make huge profits--would have paid as much as $100,000.  A small wrench that Roth bought for 12 cents had been purchased by the Pentagon for $1600.</span></p> <p><span>If even a tiny fraction of the waste that is endemic to the American military were diverted to food programs like WIC, hunger would be vastly diminished and infant mortality rates lowered.  As things stand, however, the Pentagon is going crazy and the children are going hungry--and dying.  As President Eisenhower aptly noted in 1953:  \"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.\"</span></p>"}

Ranging in shade from deep purple to pale cobalt over the course of six hours, the color seems to be strictly local; it is darkest and heaviest between Mass.

Murray has had first-hand experience with national security, from the Marine Corps through a string of positions in the Department of Defense.  But only three months after entering the relative calm of academia by taking a job at the Kennedy School of Government, Murray was called back out to the front lines, this time to Beirut.</span></p> <p><span>Appointed Director of National Security Programs at the K-School in August.  Murray joined a five-man committee confronted with the grim task of assessing official blame for the October 23 terrorist attack on the Marines headquarters in Beirut which took 241 lives.</span></p> <p><span>The committee, appointed by Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger '38, strongly criticized the Marine Corps commanders for failing to provide adequate security and for stationing all the forces in one building.</span></p> <p><span>During his two visits to Lebanon, and additional trips through Europe.  Murray says he interviewed \"everyone from the man on the ground up to generals in Europe.\"</span></p> <p><span>Even though the compound was devastated by the suicide truck bomb, which Murray says is \"the largest conventional explosion the FBI has ever investigated,\" he says, the Marine installation managed to pull together and continue their job.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Marines were hurt and shocked by the nature of the catastrophe and the deaths of their comrades, but they were still functioning,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>Murray is the only civilian member of the commission, which included officers from all of the branches of the U.S. Armed forces.  He says he initially felt ambivalent about serving on it, because of the huge time commitment it would take--he was just beginning to settle in at the K-School--and also because he thought it would be a depressing assignment.</span></p> <p><span>\"I was not enthused about it,\" Murray said.  But he was won over in part by the substantial leeway he believed the commission would have in exploring the catastrophe.  \"It wasn't a commission whose job it was to say that everything was O.K., but rather a commission that looked at the circumstances and said what it honestly found to be the case.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>\"Putting in more American forces on a fairly large scale strikes me as the least useful of the solutions.  I don't think that the country will support it...\"</b></span></p> <p><span>The process of investigating the bombing required a heavy schedule of interviews and members of the commission spent their time speaking with eyewitnesses, sentries, Lebanese soldiers, and anyone who had any connection to the bombing.  As they gathered information, the committee members would meet and debate passionately the latest findings.</span></p> <p><span>At the end of the investigation, Murray, his four counterparts and 15 aides \"spent two weeks, day and night, in a room in the Pentagon.  There was a terrific lot of arguing, but in the end there was agreement on what we wrote,\" Murray recalled.</span></p> <p><span>\"Basically the argument was:  what really happened and how to explain it both accurately and fairly to the people involved,\" Murray said.</span></p> <p><span>Another central issue was whether to recommend punishment in principal for the commanders at fault.  While the commission held the ultimate responsibility for such a catastrophe lay with those in charge, they did not recommend that Reagan levy any punishment.  \"There is not evidence to prosecute successfully,\" said Murray, adding.  \"There should not be court martialing of some people while other people escape.\"  Reagan eventually accepted this recommendation.</span></p> <p><span>Murray's own responsibility was to interview Israeli government officials to determine why the U.S. declined to use Israeli medical help when it was offered.  The injured Marines were flown to West Germany instead of taking the 20-minute flight into Israel, a decision which Murray says was practically, not politically, motivated.</span></p> <p><span>Murray said that the general in command knew the West German facilities, and that it would be inappropriate during a time of crisis to use unfamiliar facilities.</span></p> <p><span>The head of the committee, retired admiral Robert L.J. Long, strongly praised Murray.  \"He brought a fine human quality to the commission.  I am most appreciative of the service he provided.\"</span></p> <p><span>Long added that Murray has a \"broad back-ground in political military affairs, with a good understanding of the military.\"  Murray has held a variety of positions in the federal government, including undersecretary of the navy and deputy assistant secretary of defense.  Before coming to Harvard he served as dean of the Naval War College in Newport, R.I.</span></p> <p><span>Although he declined to make any recommendations on future administration policy in Lebanon, Murray said he feels the worst course would be to increase the number of troops in the war-horn country.</span></p> <p><span>\"Putting in more American forces on a fairly large scale strikes me as the least useful of the solutions.\"  Murray said.  \"I don't think than the country will support it and I don't think our interests are, that deeply at stake.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Risky Business | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>1984:  UNEMPLOYMENT SUDDENLY halts its steady drop and even begins to rise again.  The Gross Natural Product sustains a major loss approaching $70 billion.  The national deficit surges another $26 billion on top of its already record levels.  Interest rates shoot up more than 2 percent in a matter of weeks.  The Democratic nominee coasts into the Oval Office amid the ruins of a recovery for which Ronald Reagan took the credit.  What happened?</span></p> <p><span>All of these effects are projected by economic think-tank Data Resources Inc. should South America declare a general default on debt owed to U.S. banks.  The international debt crisis, which began in 1981, is deeply rooted in world events of the past 15 years, and shows with painful clarity how tightly the U.S. economy is bound to the rest of the world.</span></p> <p><span>The numbers simply boggle the mind.  The total debt of Third World nations to Western banks is approximately $300 billion.  South American countries owe $71 billion to the U.S. Citibank, the largest U.S. bank, has made loans to Brazil alone worth fully 75 percent of its total capital.  The nine largest U.S. banks have lent Third World nations more than twice their net worth--$64 billion.  These concrete-and-steel Wall Street fortresses would be completely wiped out by a Latin American repudiation of all debt to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>The paradox of this truly dangerous situation lies in its dual character.  On the one hand, long-standing historical forces play the major role behind the crisis.  However, individuals in bank board rooms throughout the West made conscious decisions in the '70s to make choices which seem, in retrospect, to be foolhardy risks.  The actions of a very small number of bank executives have put the American people in a real bind.  Hopefully these same bankers will find their own was out of the mess without a major social and governmental shake up, like the Crash of 1929.</span></p> <p><span>The historical roots of the crisis are two-fold.  First, in the post-WWH international atmosphere, best exemplified by the United Nations, the principle of national sovereignty was raised to new heights.  The \"equality\" of nations was affirmed by equal voting in the General Assembly, and new respect was supposedly owed to then existing borders and to the legal status of each nation.</span></p> <p><span>From this international attitude arose such organizations as UNESCO and the Non-Aligned Nations Conferences, amid various calls for a \"New World Economic Order.\"  This new order would supposedly redress the imbalance of wealth between the developed industrial nations and the Lesser Developed Countries (LDC's), but has instead led to the present tenuous situation.</span></p> <p><span>Second, the phenomenal post-War growth of the West, particularly Western Europe and Japan, increasingly rode on cheap Arab oil, Quietly, throughout the '50s and '60s Western dependence on imported oil steadily grew, until the sheiks gathered enough expertise and courage to take advantage of their golden opportunity.  The subsequent oil shocks of '73-'74 and '79-'80, both associated with Mideast war, dealt a severe and permanent blow to the World economy.  These shocks were a major contributor to three well-known trends of the '70s--inflation, unemployment, and conservation.  A loss to the Western economies of over $1 trillion had to be paid by someone, and it wasn't the oil companies.</span></p> <p><span>The first payments were by relatively simple inflation, but when this reached the high levels of the late '70s the Federal Reserve decided to act.  The suffering of unemployed millions resulted from this monetary brake of high interest rates.  Finally, Americans took a deep breath and conserved fuel.  Since 1973 Western industry has achieved a remarkable 31 percent increase in energy, efficiency, and consumption of gasoline has been cut by a comparable amount.  Now the U.S. is finally climbing \"out of the hole\" with one of the most vigorous recoveries ever.</span></p> <p><span><b>O</b>R IS IT?  Here's where the effects of the oil crisis become really complicated.  Here, too, greed shows its ugliest face.  When the leaders of Arab nations found themselves virtually buried by Western oil money they initially had almost nothing to buy.  Although in the last few years increasing expenditures and decreasing revenues have narrowed this surplus (in some OPEC cases eliminating and even reversing it, as in Venezuela and Nigeria), at first the leaders of Arab nations had little to do with their wealth other than send it right back to Western banks.</span></p> <p><span>Futhermore, poor countries simply did not have the money to buy the oil needed for industrial growth.  They borrowed it.  And guess who they borrowed it from?  The western banks, of course.  This triangular money/oil system never had any self-sustaining reason for existence, and so when the West reacted, oil demand dropped, and OPEC stopped making the boom profits of yesterday.  The bubble burst, and it's the Western economies and citizens who will ultimately foot the bill.  The first installments have already been made--in 1981 $2.6 billion of debt was rescheduled, over $90 billion is pegged for 1984.</span></p> <p><span>Effects of post-War sovereignty principles and the oil crisis have been cleared.  The chairman of Citibank.  Donald Platten, perhaps stated the underlying linkage of the U.S. economy to the rest of the world in the <i>New Republic,</i> when asked it he thought the banks had gone too far:</span></p> <p><span>I have never worried that the international banking system would collapse as a result of the current problems It's too unacceptable to allow that to happen.</span></p> <p><span>The banks had one reason for calling major national default \"unacceptable\" during the '70s:  How could entire nations, with tens of millions of citizens, default on billion-dollar loans Now their reason for comfort is different, as stated by Platten.  They've gone so far that the Western governments <i>cannot let them fail.</i>  No one even wants to guess at the full effects of an international banking failure, but the scenario described by Data Resources Inc would surely be a conservative estimate of the outcome</span></p> <p><span>In the end only greed is left.  Awash with petrodollars in the '70s, big banks lent to every comer with a flag and a UN seat.  Confident that this type of lending wasn't subject to ordinary precautions applied to individual customers, bankers went far out on a limb.  Now the bankers are equally confident that they've gone so far with the nation's wealth that the U.S. government will have to bail them out if worse comes to worse.  Attached to the recent emergency Congressional approbation for the International Monetary Fund were new regulations concerning just that.  Congress should be ready and willing to go farther, much farther if necessary, to forestall a similar blunder by the nation's private banks in the future.  The expectation by these bankers that they will be bailed out after their mistake achieves new heights of private-sector hypocrisy.  For the present, though, all the American people can do is hope--that the very same bank executives who squandered a huge slice of the nation's treasure will be able to retrieve it.  Someday.</span></p>"}

Ambach.  Ambach said at the time that the deputy mayor was \"technically unqualified\" for the post.</span></p> <p><span>But Wagner says that his failure to secure the appointment was in no way a factor in his decision to resign from city government.  According to his long-time friend and campaign manager John Cownorton, the deputy mayor had been anxious to leave city government \"for a respite in academic world\" a year ago, but the possibility of the new post made him delay his resignation.</span></p> <p><span>\"He stayed as long as he did out of loyalty to Koch,\" Cownorton says.

He will continue to serve on the board of New York's Metropolitan Transit Authority, overseeing a five-year capital program he helped put together, and will head a recently-announced commission on \"New York in the year 2000.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm a glutton for punishment,\" Wagner explains.</span></p> <p><span>The IOP chooses fellows for their significant public service or journalistic experience, says Fellows Coordinator Theresa Donovan.  Wagner, who plans to live off campus, will receive the normal monthly fellow stipend of $2000, Donovan added.</span></p> <p><span>The six fellows are chosen in a rolling selection process, and IOP officials say they are currently busy confirming the acceptances of the four who will join Wagner and Gergen at the Kennedy School.  Donovan said they expect to announce the remaining fellows at the end of January.</span></p> <p><span>Wagner refused to speculate on what he would do at the end of the six-month long fellowship, but friends say they wouldn't be surprised to see him spend a number of years teaching before returning to government, maybe on a state or national level.</span></p> <p><span>\"He's always had a true interest in academic affairs,\" says Cownorton.</span></p> <p><span>Those who knew him in his undergraduate days agree.

{"title": "New Horizons | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>T</b>HE REV. JESSE JACKSON'S successful rescue effort of Lt. Robert O. Goodman Jr. was a well-calculated political risk that proved to be a most telling comment on Jackson's Democratic candidacy.  Jackson's previously voiced dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party should be recognized as only a minor facet of his plans.  Jackson wants to become president, not simply bring attention to the inadequacies of President Ronald Reagan or the no-win options on the Democratic slate he opposes.</span></p> <p><span>By pegging his rescue of Goodman as a \"Mission of Mercy,\" and stating his concerns as a citizen, not a Democratic candidate, Jackson downplayed the political significance of his effort, leaving lots of room for others, particularly the media to play it up.  Jackson was smart enough to leap into a no-lose political situation.  If he had not been successful, he would still have been lauded for the attempt by his supporters and any failure could have been blamed on the State Department and Reagan's limited negotiatory stance with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.</span></p> <p><span>The controversy surrounding Jackson's effort, amid State Department warnings, insured nightly news coverage, the cheapest form of campaign publicity.  The good reverend also limited his usually heated anti-Reagan rhetoric, even going so far (upon his return) as to thank the State Department for not blocking the mission.</span></p> <p><span>The Jackson campaign workers used an age-old tactic:  if the candidate is not getting enough attention at home, send him abroad.  With Reagan's foreign policy becoming a growing thorn in his side, Jackson's concern for Goodman was well-timed.  But Jackson has a history of such maneuvers.  He has become the most recognized Black leader since the Civil Rights Movement, without running or holding any political office.  When his Operation PUSH was under investigation for questionable financial shuffling, where was Jackson?  Lending his support to Black mayoral candidates Harold Washington.  Mel King and Wilson Goode, so that their successes would reflect upon him.  Jackson has mastered the politician's genius for being in the right place at the right time.</span></p> <p><span>But the rescue of Goodman is different from past cases, because it was engineered on a higher level of political expertise.  Jackson can play up the risk of his mission (though there wasn't any politically for him) and Americans will agree with him when he says it was \"the right thing to do.\"  His is the stuff that heroes are made from.  So what will Jesse do now?  If he can keep the American public asking that question, Jackson has a chance to stay in the limelight.</span></p> <p><span>It can only be assumed then that, like the opportunist he has admitted to being, he will take advantage of his position in the forefront.  Although the press has already declared Mondale the candidate for the Democratic nomination, Jackson cannot be ignored.</span></p> <p><span>The question is whether Jackson will end one campaign and begin another.  He has been running at a ragged pace to keep the yet-to-be established office known as the Leader of Blacks.  He has successfully launced the largest voter registration movement in the country's history.  Can he move from those campaigns to a real presidential one?  In a field of Democratic candidates that make a lifelong Democratic want to vote for Reagan, it is possible that an alternative may present itself in Jesse Jackson.  The rescue of Lt. Goodman points to such an idea, still narrowly conceived amid Jackson supporters, but probably firmly planted in the mind of Jackson himself.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Four | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>I</b>t is self-evident that the year 1984 will not in the least resemble the nightmare anticipated by Orwell.  Humanity has nowhere been transformed into an amorphous mass of automatons ruled by invisible forces, a Stanlinist Gulag pushed to its logical conclusion and extended to the world at large.  This has not occurred even in Communist countries.  Quite the contrary:  although their regimes remain frozen in totalitarian molds, their reality has been persistently evolving toward more liberal forms.  The world is certainly a freer place today that it was in 1948 when Orwell wrote his anti-utopian novel.</span></p> <p><span>Orwell's fear has not materialized because like nearly all predictions it has rested on flawed methodology.  Prediction is usually no more than the projection of trends observable in the present onto the future in a straight and uninterrupted line.  Therefore, the worse it is, the worse it will get.  It has been noted that investment advisory services grow in bullishness as the stock market rises, and turn bearish as it goes down.  In other words, they do not really anticipate events, they retrace them.  Although predictions of this sort appear to look ahead, they are, in fact, always gazing backwards.</span></p> <p><span>It is, of course, contrary to common sense to assume that any trend will keep on advancing until it triumphs all along the line.  A trend postulates a countertrend, a force to be overcome, and if that latter has any <i>raison d'etre</i> to begin with, it will eventually reassert itself, and turn things around.  The Hegelian triad of thesis-antithesis-synthesis has much to recommend it as a scheme of change.</span></p> <p><span>To the extent that one wishes to predict human affairs, it seems to me, one must proceed from what are known to man.  It may, perhaps, be possible to automate individuals but it is difficult to see how this can be done to mankind.  Mankind ceaselessly regenerates itself as children come into the world, fresh, ignorant of what has preceded them and what is expected of them, keen to observe, and averse to acting as they are told.  To create a uniform world, one would have to devise a way of making acquired characteristics inheritable:  something that the charlatan biologist.  Trofin Lysenko, promised Stalin, who desperately desired such power.</span></p> <p><span>When I first went to the Soviet Union in 1957, four years after Stalin's death.  I was astounded how much independence of thought there existed under the crust of conformity, what eccentric ideas young Kussians had managed on their own to develop.  Since then, many of these ideas have spilled into Soviet public life, the vitality and exuberance of which is concealed from sight by the regime's grip on the media.  In addition, the Soviet government is discovering that the only way to increase productivity is to resort to contractual arrangements with individual workers and peasants.  Thus, in most encouraging ways, freedom of thought and freedom of contract, the two pillars of the democratic order, are injecting themselves into what was to have been a permanent prison for body and mind.  Big Brother is learning that some freedom is indispensable even to his own survival.</span></p> <p><span>I believe that there are good grounds for optimism about the future.  Regimentation works up to a point but then becomes counter-productive.  Modern economics, in particular, have become so immensely complex and so interdependent that they can no longer be effectively run from a single center.  They wither unless they allow some scope to free initiative.</span></p> <p><span>As concerns the one dark cloud that hangs over us and causes the most concern--the fear of unclear war--I believe that there are grounds for optimism here, too.  It is true that Soviet leadership gives every indication of making active preparations for war.  The pace of its weapons' procurement programs is nothing short of frenetic, while the domestic hate campaign against the United States is assuming very ugly dimensions.  Soviet defensive preparations, especially the construction of shelters to protect cadres and industries against unclear attack, also give cause for worry, since they are not matched by anything on this side.</span></p> <p><span>But, on the whole, there appears little likelihood of war in the immediate future, because these preparations are balanced by other factors.  The failure of Soviet weapons in the Middle East must give Soviet leaders pause.  The same applies to the miserable campaign waged by the Red Army in Afghanistan, where, notwithstanding its immense advantage in firepower, victory seems as clusive as ever, and resort has to be had to mindlessly brutal, almost genocidal, terror tactics The fact that Moscow sees President Reagan as a strong and decisive leader further inhibits its spirit of adventure.  The Soviet Union needs militarism and the threat of war primarily to keep at bay mounting pressures for reform inside its empire and to intimidate foreign countries, especially Europe.  Although its forces are general for waging offensive nuclear war, the imponderables of such a war are too great to tempt precipitous moves.</span></p> <p><span>The things that seem troublesome to me are of a different order.  The dissolution of family and community which proceeds apace the world over causes traditional forms of social discipline as well as support to break down setting ever more individuals adrift in a sea of anxiety; terrorism and drug addiction are among its most disturbing manifestations.  The scope of international indebtedness is also worrisome because it parts at risk the whole financial and economic structure of the world.  But for the reasons stated I remain confident that before these undesirable trends have had a chance to run their full course, countervailing forces will emerge and restore the balance.  The main thing is to stay cool and keep one's sense of humor. <i>Richard Pipes is Baird Professor of History.</i></span></p>"}
