He added that his next report to the UN Security Council will focus around an inquiry on Guantanamo Bay detainees.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is only by adherence to human rights regulations that counter-terrorism can survive,\u201d he said before a crowd of about 50.</span></p> <p><span>Even though a state\u2019s primary human rights obligation is protecting the lives of its citizens, Emmerson said that this does not \u201cmean infringing the rights of those suspected of terrorism.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cVictims demand the accountability of public officials and the rule of law, not more human rights violations,\u201d Emmerson said. \u201cThey\u2019re not asking for the use of counter-terrorism as a justification of abuse and torture\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Speaking about the upcoming presidential elections, Emmerson criticized the candidates for avoiding discussions about the drone program and waterboarding during the electoral campaign. Emmerson said that the absence of this topic in political discussions is linked to a lack of clarity surrounding American counter-terrorism policy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere is increasing international pressure for transparency and accountability,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>The UN introduced Emmerson\u2019s current position in 2005 in an effort to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms in countries\u2019 counter-terrorism programs.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s not my job to speak for the UN,\u201d the lecturer said. \u201cI speak to the UN.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Law School Lecturer Mindy J. Roseman, who introduced the speech, said that Emmerson added an important perspective to the political discussion on campus.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis talk was especially important because the issues of waterboarding and accountability that Ben Emmerson brought up today have disappeared from the presidential campaign,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>After the lecture, Law School students said they wished Emmerson had delved further into the Obama administration\u2019s counter-terrorism activities.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI wish we had a more in depth conversation about the closing of Guantanamo and the role the Obama administration has played in this issue,\u201d said Law School student Maria A. Parra-Orlandoni.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t know much about human rights, but I thought that the issue of protecting human rights within the state was very fascinating,\u201d said Cathleen Chang, also a student at HLS. \u201cI\u2019ve never thought about it that way.\u201d</span></p>"}

{"title": "Parker Lectures on Journalism and Social Change | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Brianna D. MacGregor", "body": "<p><span>The social tensions caused by existing injustices in the world ultimately serve as strong inspiration for journalists, Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Richard Parker said at an event Wednesday on journalism\u2019s role as an agent for social change.</span></p> <p><span>Parker, who came to Harvard after working at several news magazines, extolled journalism\u2014considered dying by many\u2014as a powerful arbiter in discussions of social inequality or oppression.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe all live in societies which contain injustices of various kinds and in various scopes. The inescapability of that fact creates natural tension,\u201d Parker said. He added that journalism is created by the \u201cpeople who can speak or write about the possibility of justice.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Parker spoke candidly about his experiences in journalism, from his working at shuttered political magazine Ramparts to his co-founding of the award-winning independent news magazine Mother Jones. The bimonthly magazine recently made headlines for releasing the video of presidential candidate Mitt Romney calling 47 percent of the American population \u201cdependent on government.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe role of journalism is not to reprint the Constitution. It\u2019s not to point to the flag and urge you to salute it. It is rather to do that simple thing which is captured in the phrase, \u2018Speaking truth to power,\u2019\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>But Parker\u2019s optimism for media is restricted. He explained that he still does not use social media for his journalism.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTwitter is what I let birds do outside the window,\u201d Parker said. \u201cYour generation has social media and the internet\u2014we didn\u2019t have that.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Anes Sung \u201916, who was encouraged to attend the event by friends familiar with Parker\u2019s work, said that she thought the media sometimes can offer a biased report of objective facts. \u201cThe media is becoming more influential every day. A lot of people are ignorant of important issues in the world, and the media serves to provide that information, but at the same time, not a lot of it is true, or it\u2019s biased.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Parker ended his talk with enthusiasm for journalism and a call for audience members to join the field. \u201cThink about why you do what you do, in a sense that is larger than yourself. Try to keep your fears in check, and ride your hopes as often as you can,\u201d he said.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Defending a Dream | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last week, The Crimson <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/19/obama-romney-immigration-debate/\">reported</a> on the University\u2019s lobbying effort in support of the DREAM Act in light of the upcoming presidential election. That the University is heavily involved in the debate over this legislation should not come as a surprise to anyone. Harvard has been entwined with the debate ever since the DREAM Act rose to prominence. In fact, Harvard played an essential role in bringing the DREAM Act into the spotlight. First <a href=\"http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/dream-act\">introduced</a> in 2001, the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act languished in the halls of Congress until 2010, when the <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/6/11/balderas-according-immigration-eric/\">case</a> of Eric Balderas, an undocumented Harvard student facing deportation, made national headlines. Ultimately, Balderas was not <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/06/19/harvard_student_wont_face_deportation/\">deported</a>, but his case imbued the debate with a sense of urgency, and soon after the DREAM Act came within a few votes of overcoming a filibuster in the Senate and becoming law.</span></p> <p><span>Even before the Balderas case, Harvard expressed support for this legislation, which would offer a work permit and a road to eventual citizenship upon graduation to undocumented students who arrived in the United States as children. President Drew Faust has been <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1210/46124.html\">vocal</a> in her support of the DREAM Act, showing her support through her <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/9/21/act-letter-dream-support/\">signing</a> of a letter urging Congress to pass this piece of legislation. In the past, The Crimson has praised the University and President Faust for their advocacy on behalf of this bill and the students it is designed to help. When Senator Scott Brown <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2010/09/brown_blasts_ha.html\">attacked</a> Harvard for its support of undocumented immigrants, The Crimson defended the University and its position. The University has a duty to support its students no matter what their legal status, and thankfully, the University has delivered.</span></p> <p><span>Although President Obama\u2019s executive <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/15/politics/immigration/index.html\">order</a> issued this summer implements several provisions of the DREAM Act, it does so only for a period of two years. The President\u2019s deferred action program has offered hundreds of thousands of undocumented students across the nation, and a few here at Harvard, a respite from fears of deportation and renewed hope of being able to work legally after graduation. However, the deferred action program is only a temporary measure, and the University should not be placated by its implementation. Harvard should continue to advocate on behalf of the DREAM Act, so that a permanent solution for our undocumented peers can be enacted.</span></p> <p><span>This is an issue that affects not only undocumented students, but the entire nation. America would be ill-served by a generation of immigrants denied access to a college education due to their legal status. Our current policy denies America the potential future earnings (and tax revenues) of millions of undocumented minors who stand to benefit from the DREAM Act\u2019s passage.</span></p> <p><span>This is not to say we would consider DREAM Act\u2019s passage the end of immigration reform. Even the DREAM Act itself is only a stopgap measure. It is a bill that would offer to a path to citizenship for these deserving students while the country continues to debate what comprehensive immigration reform would look like. Even if the DREAM Act were to pass and all undocumented students given a work permit and a path to citizenship, these students would still face other challenges caused by our country\u2019s broken immigration laws. Many of these students, including those at Harvard, would still have to worry about their parents or other relatives being deported, but until the fight for comprehensive immigration reforms, we urge Harvard to keep up the good work.</span></p>"}

Bobo first talked about the role of race in the election, saying that incumbent President Barack Obama uses extreme caution when calling attention to problems of race. He cited Obama\u2019s comments about his former minister, the controversial Reverend Jeremiah Wright, and his response to the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/7/20/renowned-af-am-professor-gates-arrested-for/\">Gates</a> Jr. in 2009 as examples of the political maneuvering Obama, the first black president, has employed to maintain an image of even-handedness when it comes to race.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOften the elephant in the room is the problem of race,\u201d he said. Yet even as Bobo named moments when Obama minimized race, he said that race should not be overlooked at the polls. In the 2008 election, he said, Obama received overwhelming majorities of African-American, Asian, and Latino votes.</span></p> <p><span>Hailing from the English Parliament, the Right Honourable Douglas G. Alexander, Shadow Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, offered an outside perspective on the 2012 election. He cited the rise of China, the precarious governments of the Middle East, and climate change as issues that make the election not only important in the United States, but also crucial to global politics.</span></p> <p><span>Both speakers stressed the importance of voting. \u201cThis is going to be a turnout election,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cPolitics is a contact sport and participation sport, not a spectator sport.

{"title": "A New Hope | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to travel back to the moment I found out I had been accepted to Harvard. I felt unsurpassable and overwhelming feelings of belonging and reassurance. This time, however, I was a Harvard freshman. And even though I was standing in in the middle of the Science Center mailroom, people on all sides, I was not able to hold back my tears. The letter I had received came from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. It was a notification that my application for Obama\u2019s new immigration initiative, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, had been successfully processed.</span></p> <p><span>The tear-inducing feelings I experienced that day did not stem from the weight of the promises contained in the letter. The promises of DACA are subject to the outcome of the Presidential race, and are only as guaranteed as Obama\u2019s re-election. Unfortunately, if Romney is elected, there will be virtually <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/us/politics/romneys-stance-on-obama-reprieves-panics-young-immigrants.html\">no promise</a> that the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/us/young-immigrants-poised-for-deportation-deferral-program.html?pagewanted=all\">1.2 million</a> young people eligible for this brave new incentive, including me, will benefit.</span></p> <p><span>Although there have been other instances in my life in which I have felt this keen acceptance, the feeling has always been temporary, always driven out mercilessly by an ever-present reality. Ironically, some of my most enduring feelings of pertinence have come through my affiliation with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Growing up in the Mormon Church, I have seen its efforts to promote family life and family unity, even in undocumented families. Last year, for example, the church had an influential hand in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/us/politics/romney-immigration-position-at-odds-with-mormon-church.html?pagewanted=all\">backing legislation</a> that stood against the separation of families of illegal immigrants by deportation processes. But regardless of my church\u2019s friendliness towards illegals, reality has struck, because now that there is a fellow Mormon running for office, I often catch myself praying that he does not get elected.</span></p> <p><span>Despite sympathy from my church, I can\u2019t help but recognize the increasing disparity between my life and the lives of my peers. Without documentation, the list of things I have been ineligible for seems to grow. It\u2019s a pretty long list, filled with things that may seem mundane to any other Harvard freshman, but remain strictly dream material for me: a driver\u2019s license, any form of temporary employment, eligibility for major scholarships, federal financial aid, paid or unpaid internships, and even the ability to enter any <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R41138.pdf\">federal building</a>. Even during my short time at Harvard, I have come to find that because of my immigration status, I am ineligible for any on-campus job or study abroad opportunity. For other undocumented students I know, not having these opportunities has translated to not deserving them. DACA has changed this, as it will grant <a href=\"http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=f2ef2f19470f7310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=f2ef2f19470f7310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD\">many privileges</a> we have been missing out on: Namely, a driver\u2019s license, a social security number, a permit for work, and the possibility of studying abroad.</span></p> <p><span>Counting the freedoms I lack now helps me appreciate the freedoms I have and helps me direct my decisions. Instead of dreaming of one day being assigned by my church to a mission in a foreign country (Mitt Romney served his mission in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/man-on-a-mission-mitt-romney-in-france/2012/05/13/gIQA1n3cNU_story.html\">France</a>), I have enrolled in a foreign language class here at Harvard. And although I cannot cast a vote of my own this November, I have taken to canvassing in New Hampshire with the Harvard Democrats. But volunteering for Obama is something that I do out of more than just free will. In reality, this election may be the last chance for me to secure permission to work in the United States before I graduate Harvard in 2016.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019m tired of being counted among the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/us/young-immigrants-poised-for-deportation-deferral-program.html?pagewanted=all\">millions</a> of qualified undocumented students who have been let down again and again by the DREAM Act. For years, we have watched the\u00a0Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act stagnate in Congress, rising time and time again only to be <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dream-act-senate-republicans-block-act-for-illegal-immigrant-students/story?id=12429589#.UIbjPPl26Os\">shoved to the side</a> by senatorial Republicans. But looking back on the history of the DREAM Act makes it clear why, on June 15, when President Obama <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz4MMY76fu8\">announced</a> implementation of his deferred action program, DACA immediately became a new hope for me and millions of other undocumented students.</span></p> <p><span>DACA was created simply as a result of a Presidential request to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. Taking this into account, DACA is not a long-term solution to the fragmented immigration system. DACA will actually just place me and other applicants into a sort of limbo state, where we will have to keep applying for work permits every <a href=\"http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=f2ef2f19470f7310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=f2ef2f19470f7310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD\">two years</a> and never achieve any sort of naturalization. Even though it is far from comprehensive, DACA is significant step forward in terms of consideration. For the first time, many of my undocumented friends can begin to imagine life beyond the fear of deportation. We feel that, for the first time, the country we love loves us back.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout his campaign, Governor Romney has displayed unwavering <a href=\"http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/romneys-immigration-clarification-re-clarified/\">opposition</a> to the DREAM act and any benefits for students like me. Fortunately, Romney has not had the opportunity to act on his positions. And as Election Day approaches, it falls to voters to make sure such injustice does not occur.</span></p> <p><span><i>Enrique Ramirez \u201916 lives in Greenough Hall.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "The Climate We Ask For | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As Americans, we constantly congratulate ourselves on our spirit of innovation. Yet, we give our government no incentive to be forward thinking about important long-term problems like climate change.

Politicians are accountable to voters whose main concerns generally include how to feed their families<i> </i>and keep their jobs and houses. And it is this combination of preoccupied voters and cowardly lawmakers that has kept the U.S. from tackling climate change in any sort of comprehensive way.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s no surprise that <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx\">a recent Gallup poll </a>showed 72 percent of Americans thought the economy was today\u2019s most important problem. A mere two percent saw pollution and the environment as the most important problem. Yet, the two problems are undoubtedly connected. MIT economist Henry Jacoby <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-it-matters-despite-the-weather-climate-change-gets-little-mention-in-the-campaign/2012/09/23/3cb2ea74-0582-11e2-9eea-333857f6a7bd_story.html\">predicts</a>, \u201cPeople will pay...[for inaction on climate change] in taxes, energy prices, insurance premiums, disaster relief, food prices, water bills and changes to our environment that are hard to put a price tag on.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>We\u2019re constantly flooded with startling facts about rising ocean levels and shrinking rainforests. To those who pay attention, climate change is clearly imminent, and it\u2019s approaching the brink of irreversibility. Scientists <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6108414.stm\">predict</a> a nearly complete lack of wild fish in oceans by 2050. At the beginning of his numerical rundown of the current state of the climate, activist and writer William E. McKibben '82 grimly <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719%23ixzz27YAEPGj2\">states</a>, \u201cI can say with some confidence that we're losing the fight, badly and quickly\u2014losing it because, most of all, we remain in denial about the peril that human civilization is in.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Denial isn\u2019t the only reason that the situation is stagnant\u2014for those who are thinking short-term, there is a valid economic argument against cutting emissions. The fossil fuel sector certainly isn\u2019t a small deal, and the world economy is invested in the future of drilling. Construction of the southern part of<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/keystone-xl-breaks-ground-in-texas/2012/09/21/7c68b22a-0370-11e2-8102-ebee9c66e190_story.html\"> Keystone XL</a> is already underway.</span></p> <p><span>While economic hurdles block a smooth transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy, the carbon tax represents a potent economic solution. The Kennedy School\u2019s Joseph Aldy showed his support for the carbon tax in his talk at Harvard Thinks Green 2 last week. A tax on carbon would de-incentivize the purchase of carbon and naturally force investment in alternative energies. It would provide the economic impetus currently lacking from the green movement.</span></p> <p><span>Even conservative economist and policy advisor Greg Mankiw expressed his support of a world carbon tax in a 2007 New York Times op-ed, but he doubted that a carbon tax would make it through Washington. Mankiw <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/business/16view.html\">wrote</a>, \u201cRepublican consultants advise using the word \u2018tax\u2019 only if followed immediately by the word \u2018cut.\u2019 Democratic consultants recommend the word \u2018tax\u2019 be followed by \u2018on the rich.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>It would simply be political suicide for a Republican to support a new tax of any kind, and Democrats are too busy trying to get rid of tax breaks for the rich that suggesting a carbon tax right now might very well be too much. Yet, logical thinking would demand that our lawmakers push aside all of those political fears for the sake of doing something that makes pure and total sense.</span></p> <p><span>China\u2019s Communist Party recently released its <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2012-07/05/content_15551005.htm\">new five-year plan</a>, a strategic move that will end up investing $315 billion in measures for energy efficiency. And because of the one-party system, China can afford to be aggressive in the way it pursues its alternative energy goals. The National Energy Commission has <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/09/26/us-china-solar-idINBRE88P0CV20120926\">asked</a> each province in China to provide a plan for increased solar energy use by October 15. China <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=CH\">remains</a> the world\u2019s largest coal consumer, but these steps represent a significant effort to reduce emissions. The United States is the world\u2019s largest consumer of oil, but political polarization and corporate influence would block any clean energy initiatives of a similar scale.</span></p> <p><span>So while China\u2019s alternative energy plans charge forward, the US is stuck with little to no political or economic push for sustainability.</span></p> <p><span>This problem is not unique to the U.S., and it\u2019s why very little has been done in the way of large international agreements. Recent climate discussions have all failed miserably\u2014it\u2019s as if every time someone mentions the words Kyoto, Cop10, or Rio+20, the environmental community emits a collective sigh of frustration.</span></p> <p><span>Our markets are so interdependent that changes in energy consumption have global effects, and therefore countries must tackle the issue through a combination of domestic policies and international cooperation. The U.S. could help shape the international debate on climate change, but it chooses not to because U.S. citizens have yet to demand the discussion.</span></p> <p><span>Our government spends billions of dollars each year on defense. We stockpile more weapons than we will ever use. But the prospect of entire countries being submerged under water as a result of large scale flooding is in many ways equally as scary as a nuclear Iran. And just like our founding fathers were worried about the political freedoms of every generation to come, should we not be intensely concerned about the safety and welfare of our future generations? And should we not demand from our representatives that same view?</span></p> <p><span><i>Jennifer A. Gathright \u201916, a Crimson editorial comper, lives in Wigglesworth Hall. </i></span></p>"}

Menz \u201915, a Crimson arts editor, roamed the sleepy streets of Rochester, periodically referring to their list of about 30 assigned voters, autumn leaves crunching beneath their shoes as they walked from to door to door.</span></p> <p><span>The presidential election is fewer than three weeks away, and polls suggest that New Hampshire voters are torn between the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates\u2014a fact that worries Democrats since Obama easily won the state in 2008.</span></p> <p><span>With Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney neck-and-neck in New Hampshire and nationally, front stoop conversations such as these could be the difference between Obama\u2019s success or failure.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[It\u2019s] kind of a nerve-wracking experience because they have the election in their hands,\u201d Harvard Democrats Campaign Director Simon M. Thompson \u201914 said of New Hampshire voters. \u201cYou have to let people know that this is urgent.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A CALL TO ARMS</span></p> <p><span>As the yellow school bus carrying Harvard students rolled into Rochester, Daniel R. Ki \u201915, head coordinator of Harvard for Obama, stood up to address his fellow students, many of whom were still groggy from Friday night escapades.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA typical response is no response at all,\u201d Ki warned the volunteers, drawn from the Harvard for Obama team, the Harvard College Democrats, as well as the Kennedy School and Law School.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEvery door that you knock on does make a difference,\u201d he said, while telling canvassers that typically only about 5 percent of residents will even answer their doors.</span></p> <p><span>The bus came to its destination as Ki made his last points. It was a little after 2 p.m. Canvassers filed into Rochester\u2019s Democratic campaign headquarters, a cozy office with blue walls plastered with posters and charts. A countdown reminded volunteers how few days remained in the race: 17.</span></p> <p><span>Carol Shea-Porter, an N. H. Democrat running for the House seat that she lost two years ago, was the first to address the Harvard volunteer crew.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou\u2019re the reason that we\u2019re going to win,\u201d she said, noting the significance of volunteers in her 2006 and 2008 campaigns for Congress.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWho wants to go forward?\u201d she said. She was greeted by cheers and applause.</span></p> <p><span>Mike, a campaign coordinator based in New Hampshire\u2019s Democratic headquarters, recalled how 7,211 votes separated Bush from Gore in 2000. Obama\u2019s win or loss in New Hampshire could decide the election, he said.</span></p> <p><span>New Hampshire is \u201ccarrying the United States forward,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is the most important thing you can do.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>HITTING THE STREETS</span></p> <p><span>Riled up after the pep talks, Harvard students set forth on the small, mostly empty streets of Rochester, a town of 30,000 nestled on the Maine border.</span></p> <p><span>Volunteers carried a roster of voters, a map of Rochester neighborhoods, and a stack of promotional pamphlets and flyers.</span></p> <p><span>This canvassing effort, Harvard for Obama\u2019s third trip this fall, was markedly different from earlier attempts to win New Hampshire votes. Swaying undecided votes was only a secondary focus this time. Instead, organizers told volunteers to shore up already-won votes by urging registered Democrats to turn out at the polls on Nov. 6.</span></p> <p><span>This was, in part, due to lackluster enthusiasm for Obama as compared to 2008, canvassers said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was kind of a different race,\u201d Stephanie A. O\u2019Connell \u201913, a Harvard for Obama coordinator who volunteered in New Hampshire in 2008. Four years ago, Obama was \u201ca new figure, not wrapped in politics. Now, a lot of it is about the issues,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>Mendel and Menz, both veteran canvassers, walked out of campaign headquarters, stopping in the parking lot to chart their route.</span></p> <p><span>The duo encountered a variety of reactions to their attempts to win blue votes.</span></p> <p><span>At the first house that they visited, a disheveled middle-aged man in a red bathrobe emerged, holding back a few barking dogs.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t vote,\u201d he said promptly, shutting the door behind him.</span></p> <p><span>Drawing from a script provided by campaign headquarters, Mendel and Menz soon settled into a routine, taking turns to speak to voters.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cCan President Obama count on your vote on election day?\u201d they asked again and again.</span></p> <p><span>Often, no one would be home, and after a few minutes of tapping door knockers, they would leave promotional flyers under doormats and in door handles.</span></p> <p><span>Menz and Mendel soon found themselves at a multi-family home. The pair, unable to find the specific front door they were looking for, tried the garage door.</span></p> <p><span>Moments later, the door rose, stiff wheels creaking as it came up. A woman emerged and responded enthusiastically to the questions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOh, I like him. I\u2019m going to vote for him,\u201d the woman said.</span></p> <p><span>Another man, his baby in one arm and his young son by his knees, told Mendel and Menz that he planned to bring his older child to the voting booth along with him.</span></p> <p><span>Mendel had found during past experiences that \u201cmost people just really don\u2019t want to talk to you.\u201d This effort, however, was much more successful: \u201cThe people that we did talk to didn\u2019t tell us to go away,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was a pretty friendly neighborhood,\u201d Menz added.</span></p> <p><span>A VOICE ON THE GROUND</span></p> <p><span>At 4:30 p.m., students began to gather in the garage of the campaign headquarters, grabbing snacks and swapping stories.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI had a great experience,\u201d said Micaela Pacheco Ceballos \u201915, a campus coordinator for the Harvard for Obama team. \u201cOut of the 40 houses that we visited, we talked to 10 people.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Pacheco Ceballos said that the \u201cstark differences\u201d between the candidates and a sense of \u201ccivic duty\u201d had motivated her to get involved in the campaign, mentioning that she had successfully reached out to a young, first-time voter.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEven if it\u2019s just one guy that asked to register to vote, we made a difference,\u201d said Rebecca V. Park \u201916, who campaigned in 2008 with her parents.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard for Obama Campus Coordinator Sylvia A. Percovich \u201915 canvassed although she cannot vote as she does not have U.S. citizenship.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI could participate and give back to what I consider my country,\u201d said Percovich. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have a voice in the ballot, I can have one on the ground,\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Percovich said she was pleasantly surprised by some residents\u2019 willingness to talk with a stranger about a matter that, for some, can be very personal.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPeople are really excited about the election, so they\u2019re willing to engage you,\u201d she said, alluding to one of her conversations with an undecided voter.</span></p> <p><span>Thompson, the campaign director for the Harvard Dems, also emphasized that canvassing allows students to connect with voters who have much more life experience. Thompson mentioned an elderly couple who both expressed disappointment with the negativity of politics and, therefore, had yet to decide on their votes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s always a really nice experience. It\u2019s nice to get that real world aspect,\u201d Thompson said.</span></p> <p><span>LOOKING FORWARD</span></p> <p><span>As the school bus rolled out of placid Rochester, students chatted about the day\u2019s highlights, sharing tales of feisty dogs and frustrating conversations and parsing out the differences between New Hampshire and Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span>Two hours later, the evergreens and suburban streets of Rochester far behind them, the campaigners\u2014many still wearing stickers and pins promoting the Democratic party\u2014arrived in Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span>Before the crew disembarked and returned to academics and dorm life, Ki stood up and announced the results of the day\u2019s work: they had knocked on 700 doors and spoken to over 100 New Hampshire residents.</span></p> <p><span>Already looking to the next step, Ki told the canvassers about future trips in early November.</span></p> <p><span>He asked students to participate in at least one more effort. And if they participated in all three?</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI would die of joy,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nkansra01@college.harvard.edu.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Beyond Binders | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>On the heels of Mitt Romney\u2019s most recent campaign <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/madeleine-m-kunin/binders-full-of-women_b_2009893.html\">gaffe</a> on gender equality in the workplace, a group of students at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government have staged a protest against the dearth of diversity among the school\u2019s faculty, asserting that \u201cat least Romney had binders.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/2/14/kennedy-school-faculty-women/\">1988</a>, a mere 10 percent of HKS faculty was female. In comparison, today\u2019s 27 percent female junior faculty and 19 percent female senior faculty is a noteworthy improvement. Nonetheless, there remain significant structural impediments to women\u2019s advancement in academia. Particularly, the rigidity of the traditional tenure track poses an undue burden on female academics seeking to balance the requirements of family and work. We urge HKS to examine and address its current tenure process to level the playing field.</span></p> <p><span>Significant gender disparity among the faculty at any institution is worrying. There are many ways in which interacting predominantly with male instructors can shape students\u2019 expectations of which careers they can expect to succeed in, and this is particularly relevant to HKS because many of its students will go on to pursue careers in government, a field that <a href=\"http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/fast_facts/levels_of_office/documents/elective.pdf\">remains</a> disproportionately male. It is not unreasonable to suppose that a greater number of female professors at an institution as prestigious as HKS would translate into greater female participation in government across the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>The gender disparity at HKS is especially alarming because of the high profile that gender-related issues hold in contemporary politics. There is perhaps no better <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/republicans-struggle-to-contain-mourdock-comments/\">testament</a> to this than the prominence of women\u2019s issues in the current presidential and congressional campaigns, where issues like <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/24/despite-contraception-mandate-uproar-catholics-prefer-obama-over-romney/\">contraception</a>, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/richard-mourdock-rape-comment-puts-romney-defense/story?id=17552263\">rape</a>, and <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/22/13416844-ryan-backed-more-than-one-forcible-rape-abortion-bill?lite\">abortion</a> routinely take center-stage. Students of government go on to shape policies that touch millions of lives, and the interests of men and women cannot be equitably addressed until all genders are represented equally in government.</span></p> <p><span>That HKS employs a lower percentage of female faculty than its peers suggests that some practice specific to HKS is preventing women from obtaining professorships. Professor Jane J. Mansbridge <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/2/14/kennedy-school-faculty-women/\">notes</a> that the Kennedy School\u2019s system of tenure, unlike those of some of its peer institutions, is not particularly accommodating to female academics. We encourage HKS to remain cognizant of the unique challenges posed by the tenure track when raising a family. In a culture where women more often than men are expected to and will raise their families, women continue to bear the brunt of these challenges.</span></p> <p><span>To this end, HKS should examine and consider reforming its system of tenure so that it may be more compatible with the lives of women. A number of universities, such as the University of California, <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/article/Is-Tenure-a-Trap-for-Women-/44814\">have implemented systems</a> under which tenure candidates can switch between part-time and full-time status. In the same spirit, Princeton University\u2019s track automatically <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S12/42/89K59/index.xml?section=newsreleases\">allows</a> faculty extra time to pursue tenure after having a child. Such a system would not only enable more women to pursue tenure tracks rather than poorly paid lecturer positions, but it will also increase the diversity of perspectives and consequently the intellectual productivity of HKS by facilitating the entry of both women and men raising families into tenured professorships.</span></p> <p><span>Though David T. Ellwood \u201975, dean of HKS, has commendably doubled the school\u2019s number of tenured female faculty since his appointment in 2004, he has stated that he has \u201cno immediate plans\u201d to continue closing the gap. In light of the national conversation on gender in the workplace prompted by Romney\u2019s campaign blunder of \u201cbinders full of women,\u201d we hope that HKS administrators realize the importance of prioritizing gender equality among faculty.</span></p>"}

In January, a New York Times op-ed declared: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/opinion/china-as-a-destination-for-job-seekers.html?_r=0\">Go East, Young Man</a>,\u201d and many at Harvard seem to be responding.</span></p> <p><span>Students at Harvard are studying Chinese, spending summers interning in Beijing and Shanghai, and taking coursework on related topics (for example, Michael J. Puett\u2019s course on classical Chinese philosophy is currently the College\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/13/class-shopping-justice-economics/\">third most popular class</a>, with over 500 enrollees this fall). Everywhere we look, our politicians and our teachers are encouraging us to prepare for a future of engagement with China. In 2009, President Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/p/eap/regional/100000_strong/index.htm\">pledged</a> to send 100,000 American students to China.</span></p> <p><span>The message couldn\u2019t be clearer. But how do students who are listening to this advice and preparing for careers involving China think about their prospects?</span></p> <p><span>15 years ago, the now-clich\u00e9d answer might have fallen relatively neatly into a \u201cpassion versus paycheck\u201d binary. One cohort headed to China to work in financial services as foreign capital poured into the country in the 1990s and 2000s (what we could call the \u201cpaycheck\u201d group). They often spoke little or no Chinese and had begun working on China late in life. Another group went to China to work at schools and nonprofits (the \u201cpassion\u201d group)\u2014experiences vividly described in, for example, writer Peter Hessler\u2019s \u201cRiver Town.\u201d They often focused on language acquisition and immersive experience in life on the ground in China.</span></p> <p><span>Undoubtedly, exceptions to these broad categories existed\u2014but to a remarkable extent, as I interviewed students for this article, they discussed these two received cultural types as the framework for how they had initially thought about their career options in China. Nowadays, though, the students with whom I spoke told me that this old \u201cpassion versus paycheck\u201d distinction is fading. Instead, China\u2019s continued development and the growing interconnection between the United States and China are allowing Harvard students to consider new, high-impact career paths involving China.</span></p> <p><span>Charles G. Gertler \u201913 is part of this young generation of Mandarin-speaking Americans who are innovating new forms of professional engagement with China. Before starting at Harvard, he spent a gap year in China, where he worked as an English teacher and learned Mandarin. In college, he developed a strong interest in climate issues and energy policy in China, and he intends to make his career dealing with these challenges.</span></p> <p><span>Last summer, Gertler worked at a state-owned clean energy firm, the China Three Gorges Corporation. As he considers jobs after college, he is excited about the range of consultancies and think tanks that are built on \u201ccooperation between West and East\u201d on climate issues. \u201cThe jobs that I\u2019ve seen be open to me have been jobs with institutions that are both Chinese and American or European,\u201d he said, such as the <a href=\"http://www.china-greentech.com/\">China Greentech Initiative</a>, a \u201ccommercial collaborative platform focused on identifying, developing and promoting green technology solutions in China,\u201d and <a href=\"http://www.bnef.com/\">Bloomberg New Energy Finance</a>, which has offices in the West and Beijing. These jobs simply do not fit in the \u201cpassion versus paycheck\u201d binary.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, Gertler and other students like him said that they think about their decisions from a number of different perspectives. Geography is one obvious factor. \u201cI would rather stay close to home than move to China right now, but China is certainly still my main area of interest,\u201d Gertler said. Other students with primary career interests in China told me that they are looking at jobs in Great Britain, Brazil, India, and Southeast Asia. The jobs that these students are pursuing will place them in locations outside of China but will allow them to work closely on impactful China-related issues.</span></p> <p><span>A more ambiguous factor that many students also emphasized is a company\u2019s national identity. As American students gain better Chinese language skills and a deeper understanding of China, it becomes newly possible to work at Chinese companies or at employers that, as Gertler said, are built around cooperation between China and the United States. Taking these factors together, it is easier to see the novel way that young Americans are thinking about careers engaging with China: to many young Americans, these careers offer exciting possibilities to work with colleagues from diverse national backgrounds in diverse geographies.</span></p> <p><span>Some campus groups and University organizations are facilitating this evolution in thinking about careers in China. The Harvard China Fund is one example. HCF arranges summer internship experiences in Greater China for Harvard undergraduates. They offer a few jobs in finance and a few at NGOs, as well as a variety of options in media, agribusinesses, and healthcare, according to Assistant Director Jennifer Downing. The program has a remarkable reach, with 43 participants in the <a href=\"http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hcf/internships_application.html\">summer of 2012</a>, and Harvard should continue to develop programs of this kind, including programs for post-college employment.</span></p> <p><span>As interest in careers engaging with China continues to intensify, students, the University, and prospective employers will need to understand and respond to these newly available opportunities. As the dynamic country of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.wellesley.edu/Polisci/wj/China/Deng/Building.htm\">socialism with Chinese characteristics</a>\u201d continues to grow, we may soon find a wave of \u201ccareers with Chinese characteristics,\u201d too.</span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span><i>Julian B.

{"title": "In GOP We Trust | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I distinctly remember a moment in sixth grade when I took interest in a Kerry-Edwards \u201904 sticker on my history teacher\u2019s desk. I found the paraphernalia so perplexing that I immediately went home and asked my parents a question I will never forget: \u201cHow could my teacher possibly be Catholic and a Democrat?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Growing up, I naively assumed being Catholic meant you were a Republican. Before you laugh at my ignorance, I will say that I had some pretty strong research to back my case. I had participated in a straw poll in second grade, during which only one student would admit that he (read: his parents) supported Al Gore. I went to a Catholic school, and my family went to church every Sunday. We supported Bush. Politics seemed pretty cut and dry.</span></p> <p><span>Aging makes man wiser, and I now realize that nothing is that simple. As I became more interested in the political stage, I was surprised to see how wrong my original assumption was. I discovered the seemingly impregnable nexus between Catholics and the Democratic Party. I found out that historically, most Catholics (and Catholic politicians\u2014Al Smith, John F. Kennedy, and Geraldine A. Ferraro, not to mention Joe Biden, and Kerry himself) belonged to the Democratic Party. My fallacious thinking was based purely on selection bias. Unbeknownst to me, not every Catholic lives in the suburbs and sends her children to parochial school. My elementary school may have taught me many things, but none were about diversity. It took me a long time to figure out that the suburban Catholic demographic is vastly different than the Catholic demographic as a whole. For example, I do not think the notion of an \u201cimmigrant\u201d had even occurred to me.</span></p> <p><span>Looking back on my youthful ponderings, I believe I unwittingly sensed the nascence of a national trend. Perhaps better known as \u201csuburbanization,\u201d the trend highlights the historic tendency of Catholics to participate fully in society and, by extension, to fight for the preservation of the institutions that helped them achieve the American Dream.</span></p> <p><span>Despite my incorrect assumptions early on, a look at the panoply of Catholics in the upper echelon of American governance now indicates a general shift toward the GOP. Two of the top four candidates for the presidential nomination were Catholics, as is the vice presidential nominee, the Speaker of the House, and the five Supreme Court justices appointed by Republican presidents. While Catholic Democrats still outnumber their rivals in the Senate, it is worth noting that almost half of the Republicans who came to power in the 2010 \u201cwave election\u201d are members of the Roman Catholic Church.</span></p> <p><span>The trend has created a new tossup demographic, as, losing their connection with the Democratic Party, Catholic voters have become very important in electoral politics. Political strategists on both sides are greedily eyeing the Catholic vote, and they consistently <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/the-republican-partys-catholic-cadrecoming-soon/2012/04/26/gIQAB2rRjT_blog.html\">peddle</a> <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/08/opinion/sracic-catholic-voters/index.html?iref=allsearch\">theories</a> designed to justify and predict the trend lines.</span></p> <p><span>One of the most plausible of these is the common theory that the past 20 years have been characterized by increasing Democratic antipathy to Catholic values and social positions. This argument is corroborated by the current <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/catholic-groups-file-suit-over-hhs-birth-control-mandate/2012/05/21/gIQAtVrFgU_story.html\">lawsuit</a> lobbied against the Obama administration by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops over the government\u2019s mandate that birth control must be offered by insurance plans. A countervailing notion claims that the GOP\u2019s social moderation and the diminishing power of Evangelical Christians within the party <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/DougWead/Romney-VP-Paul-Ryan/2012/08/11/id/448266\">attract</a> open-minded Catholics. A third possibility revolves around Catholic anticommunism and the cohort that came of age in the GOP\u2019s golden days during the <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1820131,00.html\">Reagan Era</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Each of these conjectures likely possesses some grain of truth. They each identify specific reasons why certain subgroups of Catholics may have reconsidered their party affiliation within the past quarter century. Yet they all seem to be missing the broader point. By attributing various explanations for three distinct types of Catholics, the punditocracy is implicitly acknowledging that the Catholic segment of America has finally arrived.</span></p> <p><span>Fifty years ago, the Catholic Church was, politically speaking, nothing more than an interest group. Catholics in the early 20th century were mostly immigrants with the number one priority of feeding their families. This was no easy task in a prejudiced America that expressed a vocal populist sentiment verging on nativism. Catholics could not rely on society, so they relied on each other. Inner-city bosses and machine politicians easily exploited this fact in a successful attempt to cater to a growing voting bloc. Catholics formed powerful unions, like the <a href=\"http://the-american-catholic.com/tag/knights-of-labor/http:/the-american-catholic.com/tag/knights-of-labor/\">Knights of Labor</a>, to represent their interests collectively in a society keen on suppressing them. This lasted for decades as Catholics continued to vote along family lines.</span></p> <p><span>That Catholics are now primarily divided between the two main political parties demonstrates an end to the Democrats\u2019 monopoly on one of America\u2019s largest religious denominations. As a quarter of the American population, Catholics are no longer a demographic swayable with pandering and petty promises. As fully engaged participants in this society, they have the luxury of being able to consider their options carefully. Different Catholics may come to different conclusions. At least now that is their choice to make.</span></p> <p><span><i>John F. M. Kocsis \u201915, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Eliot House.

The happy couple are taking their wedding vows when all of a sudden the Winkelvoss twins appear and declare that Summers had stolen what was originally their idea to elope in Swaziland with Faust.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, back in the United States, Jeremy Lin runs into Justin Timberlake and has the following conversation.</span></p> <p><span>Jeremy: Hey Justin, congrats on your marriage.</span></p> <p><span>Justin: Thanks man, congrats on the new contract.</span></p> <p><span>Jeremy: Thanks, luckily there are no strings attached.</span></p> <p><span>Justin: An N\u2019Sync joke? Really? The \u201990s called, and they want their references back.</span></p> <p><span>Jeremy: Whatever, cry me a river, man.</span></p> <p><span>Justin: Who are you to trash my career? If it wasn\u2019t for Toney Douglas\u2019 unbelievable awfulness and Mike Bibby\u2019s tragic death, nobody would even know who you are right now.</span></p> <p><span>Jeremy: Well, that\u2019s not what the Rockets think. I just signed a $28 million contract.</span></p> <p><span>Justin [laughing]: 28 million. That\u2019s cute. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what I tipped my waitress last night. Newsflash, Jeremy, $28 million isn\u2019t cool. You know what\u2019s cool?</span></p> <p><span>Jeremy: A billion dollars?</span></p> <p><span>Justin: Nah, man. Power. Power is cool. I\u2019m out.</span></p> <p><span>Jeremy: Bye, bye, bye.</span></p> <p><span>Justin\u2019s parting words\u2014\u201cPower. Power is cool\u201d\u2014stick in Jeremy\u2019s head, leading him to make a snap decision. He ignores his current plans\u2014which were only cooking dinner for Chandler Parsons, anyway\u2014and instead retires from the NBA, gets on the next plane to Boston, and replaces Faust as president of Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Back at the wedding, Abe Liu suddenly appears and says he had secretly been there the whole time, disguised as the flower girl. He explains he\u2019s now vice president of Wonderful Pistachios and was at the wedding representing the company\u2019s new president, Adam Wheeler, who had worked his way up by claiming he owned the world record for shell cracking.</span></p> <p><span>Liu begs the Winklevii twins to come home, saying their ads are an essential part of the company\u2019s business. Wheeler, Liu explains, has an idea for a website called ConnutU, the world\u2019s first social network for nuts. They only need a $100 million investment from the twins to start things up. Of course, the Winklevii readily agree and return to the United States only to discover that Wheeler and Liu have defrauded them of all their money.</span></p> <p><span>Finding there to be no wealth in professional rowing, the twins live out the rest of their lives in poverty, future subjects of the documentary \u201cThe Social Nutwork.\u201d Faust and Summers live happily ever after in Swaziland.</span></p> <p><span>B) Princeton beats Harvard in Saturday\u2019s football game.</span></p> <p><span>When Raven asked which situation I predicted would occur at 3:30 pm Saturday\u2014when the Crimson led Princeton 34-10 with 13 minutes to go\u2014you know what I would have said? I would have said B.  Because everyone knows that a documentary about a pair of nut con-men would obviously be called \u201cCashew Me If You Can.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But nonetheless, what took place in Princeton on Saturday was absolutely shocking. Harvard was completely dominating the Tigers when things escalated quickly, Brick killed a guy, and yadda yadda yadda, Harvard lost.</span></p> <p><span>For the Crimson, it was a collapse faster than that of The Wire\u2019s Barksdale empire, an ending more shocking than that of the Sopranos, a world more fantasy-like than that of Game of Thrones. For the Tigers, it was a feat more impressive than my referencing three HBO dramas in a one-sentence analogy.</span></p> <p><span>Forget the perfect season that had looked increasingly likely every day. Forget being one of the best Ivy football teams of all time. Forget the 14 straight wins, the longest streak in Division I. Forget the program points record and the top-ten FCS ranking.</span></p> <p><span>All of that was over. The fat lady had sang, the Giants had won the pennant, and Al Michaels was believing in miracles once more.</span></p> <p><span>A team that had been the epitome of dominance for 399 days and 15 hours is now staring a stunning reality in the face\u2014it might not even win the Ivy League title.</span></p> <p><span>YALE AT COLUMBIA</span></p> <p><span>Princeton\u2019s victory wasn\u2019t the only shocker of the weekend, as Yale upset Penn, 27-13, despite having to feature the double first name buddies\u2013Logan Scott and Derek Russell\u2014who came into the preseason as its third- and fourth-string quarterbacks, respectively.</span></p> <p><span>This week, Yale gets to play Columbia, coming off an upset of its own against Dartmouth.</span></p> <p><span>Only kidding, of course\u2014the Lions didn\u2019t win. They\u2019re about as bad at football as Republican Senate candidates are at talking about the female reproductive system. But Yale is really not much better, and somebody has to take this one, so I\u2019ll go with the home team.</span></p> <p><span>Pick: Columbia 21, Yale 17</span></p> <p><span>PRINCETON AT CORNELL</span></p> <p><span>If the Tigers can win this, they face Penn, Yale, and Dartmouth the next three weeks, meaning they\u2019ll likely cruise to a championship.</span></p> <p><span>But traveling to Ithaca is always tough\u2014probably has something to do with the whole \u201cleaving modern civilization\u201d thing\u2014while Princeton will have to avoid a letdown after last week\u2019s high. And if Colton Chapple can throw for 448 yards against the Tigers\u2019 secondary, Jeff Mathews can throw for 600.</span></p> <p><span>On the whole, the outcome will depend on which of Princeton\u2019s two offenses last week shows up\u2014the one from first half that couldn\u2019t break into Crimson territory or the fourth quarter one that was more unstoppable than China\u2019s GDP growth.</span></p> <p><span>I think the former is far closer to reality than the latter.</span></p> <p><span>Pick: Cornell 35, Princeton 28</span></p> <p><span>BROWN AT PENN</span></p> <p><span>I should have seen it coming when it barely squeaked by Dartmouth and Columbia, but I never thought it would get this bad. Seriously, what happened to Penn football?</span></p> <p><span>A perennial title contender and preseason poll runner-up, the Quakers are now 2-4 after losing to the double first name buddies. Senior quarterback Billy Ragone, a 2010 first team All-Ivy star, has regressed faster than LeBron\u2019s hairline and now features a 1:1 TD:INT ratio. On the other side of the ball, a once vaunted defense is now tied for second-worst in the league.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s weird, but Penn football is no longer a threat, and Brown should take this one with ease.</span></p> <p><span>Pick: Brown 31, Penn 14</span></p> <p><span>HARVARD AT DARTMOUTH</span></p> <p><span>Remember that scene in I Love You Man where Jason Segel gets drilled with a golfball and yells \u201cThis is my nightmare!\u201d?</span></p> <p><span>Well, that\u2019s what Tim Murphy was doing on Saturday while watching his team fall apart faster than Eddie Murphy\u2019s career.</span></p> <p><span>After last week\u2019s debacle, the Crimson is going to be playing angry on Saturday, which means bad news for Dartmouth (quick, someone call Rolling Stone Magazine!).</span></p> <p><span>Bill Simmons likes to talk about \u201cEff You\u201d performances, in which an elite player or team\u2014often coming off a bad loss in which people question how good said player or team really is\u2014will come out and dominate to show people they shouldn\u2019t be written off just yet. Recent examples include President Obama\u2019s second debate, Peyton Manning\u2019s 2012 season, and Eminem\u2019s \u201cRecovery\u201d album.</span></p> <p><span>That\u2019s the type of performance I\u2019m expecting out of Harvard football tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span>Pick: Harvard 49, Dartmouth 10</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Scott A.

{"title": "Beware The Spoiler Effect | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Those who follow elections often talk about the <a href=\"http://www.fairvote.org/spoiler-effect%23.UI3Y40Kc-70\">spoiler effect</a>, which is when a third party candidate takes votes away from a major party candidate, resulting in a win for the opposition. Green Party candidate Jill Stein has put the 2012 Presidential election at risk of succumbing to the spoiler effect: If voters who would otherwise have cast votes for Obama instead vote for her, she might precipitate a Romney victory. So I appeal to anyone who cares about social justice, civil rights, or climate change to vote for Obama.</span></p> <p><span>Many people I know are fed up with the electioneering of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. Their influence of special interests and a refusal to give concrete details is more than frustrating. Instead, the people that I know are turning toward <a href=\"http://www.jillstein.org/climate\">Jill Stein</a>. Her main platform, the \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d is aimed at stopping climate change and getting our economy back on track.</span></p> <p><span>I recently heard Stein speak at a rally, and her perspectives on why our political system is broken were enlightening and encouraging. It is good to know that there are people who are speaking out against the current inefficacy of American government. But while Stein\u2019s commitment to mitigating global warming is admirable, a vote for Jill Stein is a wasted vote. She will not win this election.</span></p> <p><span>The spoiler effect has jeopardized many significant elections in the past. The most prominent example is the <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/25/politics/third-party-candidates/index.html\">2000 President election</a>, in which Green Party candidate Ralph Nadar received 94,000 votes in Florida, contributing to Democratic Party candidate Al Gore\u2019s losing the election. Thus began an 8-year-long disaster under George W. Bush. I would count the Iraq War, civil rights abuses, a plummeting economy, and rampant climate change as all consequences of 94,000 votes that a third party candidate took from Al Gore.</span></p> <p><span>The same thing happened in my home state of Maine. In our <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/11/03/maine.governor/index.html\">2010 gubernatorial\u00a0 election</a>, a right-wing Republican, Paul LePage, won with only 38 percent of the popular vote. The Independent and Democratic candidates split the remaining votes, receiving 37 percent and 19 percent respectively. Now, generally liberal Maine has a Governor who has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/07/paul-lepage-maine-governor-obamacare-irs-gestapo_n_1656515.html\">compared</a> the IRS to the gestapo and has <a href=\"http://www.wcsh6.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=144438\">told</a> the NAACP, \u201ckiss my butt.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As an environmentalist, I am not willing to risk anything on the chance that Romney might win this election. Like others, I have been disturbed by the pervasive \u201c<a href=\"http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/one-reason-for-debate-climate-silence/\">climate silence</a>\u201d in the presidential debates. For the first time since 1988, global warming\u2014the most serious issue facing humanity today\u2014was not mentioned during any of the debates. Obama mentioned the mythic \u201c<a href=\"http://www.policymic.com/articles/16761/obama-wins-second-presidential-debate-binders-full-of-women-quote-goes-viral\">clean coal</a>\u201d and Romney called for more <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/2012-presidential-debate-full-transcript-oct-16/story?id=17493848\">offshore</a> oil drilling and fossil fuel infrastructure. On the whole, neither candidate has demonstrated a deep commitment to real discussion about climate change. Nonetheless, Obama is clearly more committed to halting climate change than his competitor. At the very least, he has <a href=\"http://www.treehugger.com/environmental-policy/obama-talks-climate-change-mtv-video.html\">broken </a>the climate silence on MTV, and we cannot ignore the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/climate-change\">efforts </a>that he has taken during his presidency to reduce America\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels.</span></p> <p><span>If the Romney and Ryan ticket wins, not only will climate change be pushed off of the agenda, but our civil rights will be jeopardized. These two men do not support<a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/Mitt_Romney.htm\"> same-sex </a>marriage. Romney\u2019s cavalier and objectionable attitude towards women, as evident by his \u201c<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-presidential-debate-binders-women-20121016,0,3801080.story\">binders full of women</a>\u201d remark, will manifest itself in dangerous policies. Romney endorsed a GOP senator who said that \u201cGod intended\u201d <a href=\"http://www.standard.net/stories/2012/10/25/romney-backs-gop-senate-candidate-despite-rape-comment\">rapes</a> that lead to pregnancies. During his time as Massachusetts governor, he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/opinion/mr-romneys-version-of-equal-rights.html\">vetoed </a>a bill that would have provided emergency contraception to rape victims. If Americans elect a politician with these values, civil rights in our country will be doomed.</span></p> <p><span>I acknowledge that our political system is broken and overrun with special interests. But there is a clear choice between President Obama and Governor Romney. I am too frightened for our future to sit by and hope that Jill Stein does not jeopardize an Obama victory. There is too much at stake. So, I will be voting for Barack Obama in next week\u2019s election\u2014and I hope that others who care about the environment and civil rights will too.</span></p> <p><span><i>Chloe S.

{"title": "Remembering Romney | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>With the election right around the corner, the presidential race is getting intense. Obama and Romney are <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/election.aspx\">neck and neck</a> in the polls, my inbox is periodically inundated with emails asking for last minute donations, and I am beginning to fear that the election of Romney to the presidency is a real possibility.</span></p> <p><span>There are so many unappealing things about the prospect of having Romney as president that it is nearly impossible to choose any one of them as the least appealing. However, there is one aspect of his campaign that has bothered me consistently both as something that I do not feel has been addressed widely enough, and something that I believe I have a slightly more personal understanding of than most. As a lifelong resident of Massachusetts, I cringe whenever he references one of his \u201cachievements\u201d as governor of Massachusetts. A large part of his campaigning has emphasized his success in creating jobs, improving education, and balancing the budget without raising taxes in Massachusetts, but unfortunately, much of what he says about his governorship is so skewed and misrepresented as to be no better than lies.</span></p> <p><span>First of all, Romney did <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1139858/-Massachusetts-schools-are-great-but-don-t-credit-Mitt-Romney-with-that\">not</a> really improve education in Massachusetts during his stint as governor. Massachusetts has always had a strong public education system, and although Romney did not make many cuts in school budgets or do much to negatively affect the already existing school system, he also did not do anything to actively improve the preexisting system. Furthermore, he threw his support wholeheartedly behind the <a href=\"http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/11/6/81114.shtml\">Unz ballot initiative</a> when he was running for governor, an initiative that, once passed, was actually a huge blow to education in the state. This initiative mandated that public schools in Massachusetts could not teach bilingual classes, which made learning and teaching much more difficult across the commonwealth. Furthermore, the dropout rate in the state<a href=\"http://www.wgbh.org/articles/Total-Immersion-Assessing-English-Only-Education-In-Massachusetts-3293\"> doubled</a> over the three years after the initiative passed, with a large percentage of the students dropping out being students who did not speak English as a first language, and thus a system that had worked well was scrapped for a system that was shaped by xenophobia.</span></p> <p><span>Secondly, though it is true that Romney did not raise taxes as governor, he did cut state aid to many cities and towns, which resulted in those towns themselves raising property taxes on their residents. Thus, many working- and middle-class families did end up having to pay more taxes. Furthermore, rather than raising taxes even a small amount on the many upper-class residents of the state, he <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/how-mitt-romney-handled-massachusetts-spending-problems/1240133\">cut funding</a> to many extremely important programs that disparately help working-class people, such as programs that provide aid to teen parents and provide aid to families living in poverty. As much as he tries to portray the changes that he made to the Massachusetts budget as solely positive, his policies negatively affected the poor. He also did not do as much for job creation as he claims. The job creation rate during his governorship was extremely low, only <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mitt-romney-tries-to-play-the-jobs-card-2010-02-23?pagenumber=1\">0.9 percent</a> (compare this to the national average of five percent), which meant that the job growth in Massachusetts ranked <a href=\"http://www.massinc.org/Press-Room/Press-Coverage/MA-lags-in-job-creation-Springfield-Republican.aspx\">49th in the country</a> over the six years he was governor.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, though Romney touts his time in Massachusetts as evidence of his commitment to bipartisanship, his record does not really support this claim. He <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/vetoing-truth-mitt-romneys-bipartisan-claims-are-recorded-his-governorship-847299\">issued</a> over eight hundred vetoes during his time as governor, most of which were overturned by a Democratic Massachusetts House and Massachusetts Senate. The relationship that existed between him and the legislature was more of a struggle than a symbiotic relationship.</span></p> <p><span>However, the one good thing that was actually accomplished under his governorship is the one thing that he seems to be strangely uncomfortable fully owning up to. The state-wide healthcare system passed under Romney did a lot of good for a lot of people, and was actually a model for the healthcare plan passed under Obama, commonly known as Obamacare.\u00a0 Though Romney\u2019s plan was nearly identical to Obama\u2019s, Romney continually criticizes Obama\u2019s system and gives a skewed account of the plan passed during his term. For instance, Romney brags that he did not have to raise taxes in order to finance the plan, but conveniently leaves out that the federal government <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/health/health_stew/2012/08/romneycare_vs_obamacare_which.html\">provided funding</a> for most of the plan.</span></p> <p><span>I already had to live through four years of Romney, four years of bemoaning his inability to achieve his economic goals without affecting poor people, of seeing the terrible outcome of a xenophobic initiative that he supported unfolding around me in my school, and of seeing the repeated clashes between him and the legislature play out on the television. He was antithetical to nearly everything that I feel Massachusetts stands for, and if elected president, I am certain that he will be antithetical to all the good that this country is capable of as well.</span></p> <p><span><i>Reed E.

The debate was sponsored by a consortium of Boston media outlets and was to be moderated by CNN\u2019s John King.</span></p> <p><span>Tuesday\u2019s debate was expected to be the last of four between the candidates. Regina Daley, media relations manager for debate host WGBH, said that the consortium is working to reschedule the debate later this week, but ultimately the decision to debate will be up to the campaigns.</span></p> <p><span>As Brown stepped off the campaign trail and into disaster relief mode, political experts said he may end up benefiting politically from the storm and its aftermath.</span></p> <p><span>According to former Boston City Councillor Lawrence S.

Deval L. Patrick \u201978 until the storm had passed.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cToday the focus should be on safety.

Daschle who gave a lecture at Harvard Medical School on Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI am reluctant to say this, but I have to acknowledge the truth of it: [health reform] is going to happen regardless of who\u2019s elected president,\u201d Daschle, who is a Democrat, said. \u201cThere is going to be a dramatic transformation [in health care] over the next ten years one way or the other.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In his lecture entitled \u201cThe Affordable Care Act: A New Paradigm for Health in America,\u201d Daschle forecasted \u201cinexorable\u201d and \u201cnear-term\u201d improvements in transparency, information, and quality.</span></p> <p><span>The event was the HMS Department of Health Care Policy\u2019s 12th Annual Marshall J. Seidman Lecture on Health Policy. Past lecturers include former U.S. Senator William H. Frist and former Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers.</span></p> <p><span>The former Senate majority leader from South Dakota discussed the partisan disagreement surrounding the role of government and identified the \u201ctests\u201d that the Affordable Care Act has and will face. Daschle said that even if Obama is re-elected, the Affordable Care Act will continue to be challenged in the courts and in the legislature. He also anticipated challenges in the implementation of the Act\u2019s reforms.</span></p> <p><span>Daschle closed his lecture by contrasting the politicized character of health care policy and the insulated nature of monetary policy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cUnfortunately, health care policy-making in this country has become so politicized and so complex that, just like our monetary system, I honestly don\u2019t think that Congress has the capacity on a daily basis to manage it,\u201d Daschle said. \u201cI believe that we need to create a \u2018Health Fed,\u2019 a body that allows thoughtful decision making with the opportunity for Congress to override any decision they don\u2019t like.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>During the question and answer portion of the lecture, Daschle called on the work of health care policy lecturer Donald M. Berwick \u201968, who was asked to provide perspective on physician leadership in implementing health care reform.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think we know what better care looks like,\u201d Berwick said. \u201cWe actually know how to give better care at lower cost, but it\u2019s a matter of will and follow-through, and execution and change.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>When asked whether he believed the relationship between Congress and the Executive Office would improve in the next four years, Daschle noted the barriers of partisan politics. However, he said that he remains optimistic.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe election allows for a new stage to be constructed, upon which different scenarios can play themselves out,\u201d said Daschle. \u201cI do think there is an opportunity for a new dialogue.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>After the lecture, Berwick said that Daschle added an important perspective to the discussion about the Affordable Care Act.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou had a very sophisticated politcal expert talking about the inevitability of change,\u201d Berwick said following the lecture. \u201c[Daschle] sees as I see it: tectonics of health care change in the next decade are going to play out.\u201d</span></p>"}
{"title": "God Bless the King! | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Over the past few weeks, I have found it nearly impossible to watch any video on YouTube without first being assaulted by an attack ad from the campaign of either Elizabeth Warren or Scott Brown. With control of the Senate hanging in the balance, this fiercely contested race has garnered more coverage than almost any other in the country. There is no doubt that the outcome of this race will have a huge impact on whether the next president will be able to carry out his agenda effectively. Yet travel a few hours north, and you will encounter a Senate race that just might have a more long lasting impact.</span></p> <p><span>When Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) announced her retirement last February, political commentators mourned the loss of a moderate stalwart in the Senate. Throughout her tenure, Senator Snowe always stood for pragmatism and bi-partisanship, even forming a part of the Gang of 14, the group of senators that successfully ended the gridlock over President Bush\u2019s nominees to the Supreme Court. It was the growth of this very same gridlock that Senator Snowe cited as the reason for her departure. As a moderate Republican in the Senate, the senator was a member of a very small club, one that seemed to get smaller every election cycle. The rise of the Tea Party made targets out of Republican senators who strayed from conservative principles and made a habit of reaching across the aisle (gasp!). This new trend ended the political careers of several Republican senators, including Dick Lugar (R-Ind.) and the late Arlen J. Specter (R-Penn.), both moderates who lost tight primary races against more conservative opponents. In left-leaning Maine, however, Senator Snowe was virtually guaranteed re-election, which only serves to show just how inhospitable the Senate had become to moderates like her.</span></p> <p><span>Fortunately, soon after her announcement, a <a href=\"http://bangordailynews.com/2012/03/05/news/state/angus-king-announces-run-for-maines-u-s-senate-seat/\">candidate entered</a> the race that promised to continue Senator Snowe\u2019s legacy of moderation. With less than a week before Election Day, Angus King, the mustachioed former governor of the state, seems a lock to be the next Senator from Maine. Running as an Independent, King has the potential to be even more bipartisan than his predecessor. His positions show that he might be a true maverick in the Senate in the mould of John McCain before his turn to the right in the 2008 campaign left the term devoid of almost all meaning. On healthcare, King <a href=\"http://angus2012.com/issues/\">backs Obama\u2019s reform</a>, but concedes that it could use improvements. On financial reform, he has come out <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/maine-senate-race-king-stands/story?id=17485472#.UJB7yml26Qc\">against the Dodd-Frank Act</a>, which the President touts on the campaign trail as one of his most important achievements. After serving as governor, King <a href=\"http://www.pressherald.com/news/angus-king-defends-his-wind-career_2012-09-16.html\">co-founded a wind power company</a> <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/10/14/Angus-Kings-Next-Public-Raquet\">and served on the board of directors</a> of a natural gas engineering company, showing his commitment to an energy policy that makes use of a diversity of sources.</span></p> <p><span>On the most important issue that will face the next Congress, King has taken a responsible position by endorsing the Simpson-Bowles commission report as the basis for any meaningful fiscal reform. One of the co-chairs of the commission, Erskine B. Bowles, has <a href=\"http://angus2012.com/issues/\">endorsed</a> King saying that he is in \u201ca unique position to bridge the partisan divide and negotiate a solution to the debt crisis.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Beyond policies, King\u2019s calm demeanor could also help cool our nation\u2019s political rhetoric. His campaign ads conspicuously lack the ominous voiceover that seems to be the staple of most ads this election season. When Republican-affiliated groups attacked his record as governor, King did not respond in kind. Instead, he aired an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTyD7k8ZS7o\">ad</a> in which he looked directly at the camera and reassured voters that he is not the Godzilla portrayed by attacks against him. In fact, all of King\u2019s ads follow the same simple formula: just him in front of a camera speaking to voters. His ads do not feature any soundtracks, photo ops, or any other clich\u00e9s of the political ad genre.</span></p> <p><span>King, however, will face some difficulties due to his Independent status. Unless he caucuses with whichever party ends up in the majority (more likely than not, the Democrats), it is unlikely that he will receive his favored committee assignments. He will have to avoid the temptation of locking himself into a partisan label, so that he can more effectively bring the ever more divided Senate closer together. King has already shown that he is willing to fill this role through his pledge to work on a <a href=\"http://angus2012.com/issues/\">reform of the filibuster</a>, the Senate parliamentary rule that often brings the parties to an impasse.</span></p> <p><span>With the average poll giving King a fifteen-point lead over his Republican opponent, it seems voters in Maine will continue their tradition of sending moderates to the Senate. Olympia Snowe\u2019s retirement, which at first seemed like a tragedy, just might be a blessing in disguise. Come January, King will bring a new centrist vigor to the Senate. We can only hope that the rest of Congress will be inspired by King\u2019s independence and come together to solve the serious problems that our nations faces.</span></p> <p><span><i>Jos\u00e9 I.

{"title": "It\u2019s the Priorities, Stupid | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Four years ago, while most of us were still in high school, we watched helplessly as the global financial system crumbled. Many of our parents and neighbors lost their jobs, and our futures suddenly became much less certain than they had ever been. Since then, we\u2019ve seen class after class of peers graduate into an unforgiving job market that is stubbornly slow to improve. We understand that this is not the recovery that the Obama administration <a href=\"http://otrans.3cdn.net/ee40602f9a7d8172b8_ozm6bt5oi.pdf\">predicted</a>, but neither are we na\u00efve about the severity of the crisis that preceded it. In fact, it is largely through the ingenuity of the Obama administration and Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke \u201975 that we avoided the kind of depression witnessed in the 1930\u2019s.</span></p> <p><span>While President Obama\u2019s stewardship of the economy has been admirable, it is important to also assess both the candidates\u2019 past performances and their respective priorities when deciding who to support this November. The president is responsible not only for encouraging economic growth but also for establishing our national agenda. With his emphasis on education, innovation, and home investment, President Barack Obama is working to lay the groundwork for the kind of society we\u2019ll be proud to enter upon graduation.</span></p> <p><span>Education is the individual\u2019s key to success in today\u2019s society, as well as our nation\u2019s key to success in the world at large. Barack Obama has <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/obama-and-romney-on-the-issues-education/2012/10/05/2e0554ce-0f1b-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_story_2.html\">shown</a> himself to be a tireless advocate for students and, by extension, our national competitiveness. He has increased the amount of available Pell grants, and has successfully prevented interest rates on student loans from doubling. His 2010 restructuring of the federal student loan program under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which ended the practice of subsidizing private-sector loans to students, has allowed increased funding to reach young people instead of flowing into the coffers of America\u2019s largest banks. This kind of creative and effective solution demonstrates that the President is serious when he pledges to help American students get the education today\u2019s economy requires. Additionally, the Obama administration has taken a hard line against for-profit universities, which frequently <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/12/17/colleges-forprofit-students-percent/\">underperform</a> in their educational mission. When it comes secondary education, the president has supported maintaining the accountability associated with No Child Left Behind, while easing up on the parts that are overly punitive and unconstructive. This focused flexibility is essential when solving problems as complex as K-12 education in America.</span></p> <p><span>Mitt Romney, on the other hand, has <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/obama-and-romney-on-the-issues-education/2012/10/05/2e0554ce-0f1b-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_story_2.html\">oscillated</a> between an intellectually impoverished game of \u201cme too\u201d on Pell grants and federal student loan interest rates, and a run-of-the-mill attack against conservative b\u00eates-noirs like universities, bureaucrats, and teachers unions. Furthermore, his unspecified commitment to balance the federal budget while reducing tax rates across the board and raising military spending force us to <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=3658\">question</a> whether those tax cuts for millionaires might come at the expense of student-oriented programs.</span></p> <p><span>Yet the divergence in priorities does not end with education. President Obama believes in marriage equality; Mitt Romney opposes it. President Obama wants to mildly reduce military spending to create a more modernized force and free up funds for domestic investment; Mitt Romney wants to establish a <a href=\"http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2012/10/28/presidential-stances-on-defense/\">minimum</a> level of military spending, and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/05/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-would-spend-2-trilllion-military/\">raise</a> it well above its current level. President Obama believes the government has a roll to play in encouraging the development of valuable industries like sustainable energy; Mitt Romney does not find such a roll for government. President Obama believes in a deficit reduction plan combining spending cuts and tax increases; Mitt Romney is a <a href=\"http://www.atr.org/mitt-romney-signs-taxpayer-protection-pledge-a1872\">cosignatory</a> of Grover Norquist\u2019s \u201cno-tax\u201d pledge, which directly subordinates the government\u2019s revenue-raising capabilities to a private interest group.</span></p> <p><span>At the end of the day, this presidential race presents a stark choice between priorities.</span></p> <p><span>Values are important. To treat this election as a referendum against some arbitrary standard of recovery in a nearly unprecedented economic crisis overlooks a large part of why we elect presidents. Not only has President Obama has shown himself an effective economic steward, but he also is prepared to make the choices necessary to keep America on top in the 21st century.</span></p>"}

Sure, Romney would be quicker than Obama to praise Israel, but on actual policy, their positions would necessarily be remarkably similar.</span></p> <p><span>Moving west, regardless of whether or not the Obama administration deliberately <a href=\"http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2012/10/house-oversight-chair-issa-obama-administration-absolutely-misled-us-on-benghazi-attack-video/\">misled</a> the public on last month\u2019s attack in Benghazi, American foreign policy in Libya under either candidate would continue to awkwardly balance oil and security interests with humanitarian interests. Ditto for the rest of North Africa and the Gulf. During Monday\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/us/politics/transcript-of-the-third-presidential-debate-in-boca-raton-fla.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;\">debate</a>, Romney even explicitly approved of Obama\u2019s handling of the outbreak of revolution in Egypt.</span></p> <p><span>Onward to Syria. Romney calls for American funds to arm Syrian militias <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/08/romney-obama-failed-leadership-middle-east\">that</a> \u201cshare our values\u201d and for the transfer of heavier weapons to those militias. Romney\u2019s failure to specify what he means by heavier weapons or how we would locate groups with our values convinces me that these assertions are nothing more than campaign rhetoric. Like Obama in 2009, Romney in 2013 would similarly adopt positions more in line with the status quo than his campaign promises suggest.</span></p> <p><span>When Vice President Joe Biden stopped chortling at the recent vice presidential debate, he and Romney\u2019s running mate Paul Ryan engaged in a serious <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/10/11/162754053/transcript-biden-ryan-vice-presidential-debate\">debate</a> about the Obama administration\u2019s handling of Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons development. However, during the last presidential debate, Romney appeared much less critical of the administration\u2019s efforts over the last four years. In fact, Romney could only vaguely <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/us/politics/transcript-of-the-third-presidential-debate-in-boca-raton-fla.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">promise</a> \u201ctightening sanctions\u201d and \u201cdiplomatic isolation,\u201d which are two approaches Obama and his administration likely already explored.</span></p> <p><span>In a <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/blog/foreign-policy-address-virginia-military-institute\">speech</a> last month, Romney asserted, \u201cWhen we look at the Middle East today\u2014Iran closer than ever to nuclear weapons capability, with the conflict in Syria threatening to destabilize the region, with violent extremists on the march\u2026it is clear that the risk of conflict in the region is higher now than when the president took office.\u201d Of course, he is right, but one can hardly blame the president for that reality, nor can Romney make a convincing case that the region would look differently had he been in office instead of Obama.</span></p> <p><span>Admittedly, my country-by-country analysis may have sacrificed depth for breadth, but the point is that, even in the details, Obama and Romney\u2019s policy prescriptions for the Middle East only differ by the platter they are presented on. Devoted to that platter more than the substance that rests on it, many Democrats and Republicans are deeply uncomfortable with the vast similarities between Obama and Romney\u2019s platforms for foreign policy in the Middle East.</span></p> <p><span>If the president\u2019s record over the last four years has taught us anything, it is that campaign rhetoric rarely translates into policy. Since election season seems to endow Americans with selective hearing and collective amnesia, let us recall Obama\u2019s plans four years ago.</span></p> <p><span>Obama took office with many aspirations for the Middle East that were at best na\u00efve\u2014and more likely foolhardy. Direct <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/24/us/politics/24transcript.html?pagewanted=all\">negotiations</a> to pacify Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions? Not quite. <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/fatah-memo-we-lost-hope-in-obama-for-caving-to-zionist-pressure-1.6182\">Force</a> Israel and Fatah back to the negotiating table? Never mind. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/29/world/middleeast/29syria.html\">Normalization</a> of relations with Syria as a <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/04/06/090406fa_fact_hersh\">path to peace</a> in Palestine? Yikes. Immediate <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2009-01-22/politics/guantanamo.order_1_detention-guantanamo-bay-torture?_s=PM:POLITICS\">closure</a> of Guantanamo Bay? LOL.</span></p> <p><span>Obama\u2019s foreign policy in the Middle East today is not reminiscent of Jimmy Carter\u2019s, as Republicans sometimes suggest, but nor is it similar to the foreign policy Obama promised during his 2008 campaign. Don\u2019t tell a party demagogue from either side, but it is largely an extension of the foreign policy built by the Bush administration.</span></p> <p><span>Some of my friends, especially Jewish Americans and Arab Americans, describe themselves as \u201csingle issue voters,\u201d in reference to Middle Eastern affairs. I would recommend that they find another issue to base their votes on in this election.</span></p> <p><span><i>Eric T.

{"title": "Our Very Own Campaign of Terror | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>According to some of the best available <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drones/\">data</a>, the United States has, since 2004, killed anywhere between 2,500 and 3,300 people in Pakistan using drone strikes. Of those killed, around 500 to 900 are suspected of having been civilians, including 176 children.</span></p> <p><span>And now, a just-released <a href=\"http://livingunderdrones.org/\">report</a> compiled by Stanford and NYU students reveals how our country\u2019s drone campaign, which has been expanded <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/06/24/obama-s-muslim-world-fantasy-early-hopes-undermined-by-drone-war.html\">fivefold</a> under Obama, is responsible for mass-suffering and civilian death in the northwest region of Pakistan.</span></p> <p><span>The evidence offered in this new report, along with what we knew before, makes it clear that the US needs to significantly reform its use of drones in the region, if not completely abolish it.</span></p> <p><span>The report exposes that, far from being the \u201csurgically precise and effective tool[s]\u201d most Americans believe them to be, drones are actually incredibly violent and messy. It points out that, \u201cwhile civilian casualties are rarely acknowledged by the US government, there is significant evidence that US drone strikes have injured and killed civilians.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The United States, in its Pakistani drone campaign (along with parallel campaigns elsewhere) has targeted a range of public establishments, from village squares to schools, in the pursuit of eliminating accused terrorists. This wide scope of targeted structures has, understandably, created a sense of fear and helplessness within the communities living under drones. As one villager interviewed in the report explains, \u201cEveryone is scared all the time. When we\u2019re sitting together to have a meeting, we\u2019re scared there might be a strike. When you can hear the drone circling in the sky, you think it might strike you. We\u2019re always scared.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The terror experienced by these Pakistani citizens, a terror documented through the many interviews and polls within the report, is far from surprising. All one must do to understand it, in fact, is look at just who and what our government has attacked using drone missiles in the past.</span></p> <p><span>Time and again, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/07/19/drones/\">the US has claimed</a> to have successfully eliminated multiple military targets in a strike, only to have it later revealed that there were heavy civilian casualties and few, if any, real militant deaths. Three such instances of this pattern are documented in detail by the Stanford-NYU report, and they serve to show just how unreliable the \u201cofficial\u201d accounts of drone attacks can be, while also highlighting the attacks\u2019 innately devastating nature.</span></p> <p><span>Add to this the fact that the Obama administration now officially records any military-age males killed in drone strikes as \u201cmilitants\u201d, and it\u2019s not hard to see why these Pakistanis are so afraid for their lives.</span></p> <p><span>The Obama administration has also approved the use of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/white-house-approves-broader-yemen-drone-campaign/2012/04/25/gIQA82U6hT_story.html\">\u201csignature strikes\u201d,</a> drone attacks that target individuals whose identities are unknown yet who seem to exhibit behavior in line with that of an active militant. The broad power this grants our government\u2014to kill people we haven\u2019t even identified living thousands of miles away\u2014is frightening in its own right. Couple that power, though, with our track record for mistakenly killing civilians in the place of actual militants, and the terror felt by each person forced to live under our drones is made even more tangible.</span></p> <p><span>Apart from engaging in signature strikes, the US has also seems to be willing to attack both the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/world/asia/us-drone-strikes-are-said-to-target-rescuers.html?_r=0\">rescuers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/03/american-drones-kill-12-pakistan\">mourners</a> of drone victims. This practice is, on its face, morally grotesque, as it literally means we are targeting people who seek only to save others' lives or honor their deaths, those first-responders at the strike zone and those family and friends gathered at the funeral. Yet our government continues to commit these \u201cfollow-up\u201d strikes in the hopes that they will kill further suspected terrorists, no matter the cost.</span></p> <p><span>Such clearly unjust and destructive drone practices don\u2019t just fill the affected Pakistani populations with terror, either. They also fill them with rage, and in doing so help foster the very anti-American sentiment that our foreign enemies thrive off of. In the report, an affected mental health professional notes \u201cthe impact [the drone program] has on personality development,\u201d stating that \u201cpeople who have experienced such things, they don\u2019t trust people; they have anger, desire for revenge.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>So now, amongst all the collateral deaths and destroyed properties, we find that the policy we have instated to fight terrorism may very well be fueling it.</span></p> <p><span>Consider that for a moment.</span></p> <p><span>Not only does it turn out that our drones terrorize entire Pakistani villages, but they might not even achieve their intended goal of combating terrorism. We simply cannot continue a policy that so indiscriminately and insensitively kills innocent civilians, especially when its efficacy is so called into question.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, because of its bloody record, our drone campaign has now come to embody the very terror it originally sought to vanquish.</span></p> <p><span>Targeting emergency first-responders, or those gathered at funerals, or those attending village meetings, or those who\u2019s identities we don\u2019t know, or even those who are simply in the area and over eighteen\u2014these are not the policies of a nation defending its freedom; these are the policies of a nation terrorizing another\u2019s populace.</span></p> <p><span>America now has the responsibility to either change or end its drone program. That\u2019s it.</span></p> <p><span>If we continue on like this we are embracing the very terrorism we claim to despise, and in doing so are abandoning the very values we claim to defend.</span></p> <p><span><i>Tyler VanValkenburg \u201916, a Crimson editorial comper, lives in Canaday Hall.</i></span></p>"}

{"title": "Pay It Forward | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>On January 26th, in a speech at the University of Michigan, President Obama announced a large number of reforms to college financial aid programs, specifically tying a college\u2019s eligibility for funding to that college\u2019s ability to keep tuition fees down. This would apply to programs such as Perkins loans, work-study jobs and supplemental grants for low-income students. However, his speech has stirred some controversy, as state-funded colleges have already had to cut significant costs as a result of previous fiscal reforms implemented by the Obama administration. Ultimately, Obama\u2019s reforms are positive changes, considering that most schools are ill equipped to help their students deal with the ever-increasing cost of higher education.</span></p> <p><span>Education in America is quite expensive compared to education in other countries. The United Kingdom, which has a higher education system on par with that of the United States in terms of quality, has a maximum cap on education tuition of \u00a39000 (or USD $14,300). Obama\u2019s reforms will significantly help to alleviate the serious financial burden of American higher education.\u00a0 He specifically addresses the problem of interest rates on student loans, which can be as high as 25 percent for private student loans. Obama\u2019s plan will make it easier for students graduating from high school to apply for and eventually pay for college and will improve the work-study program.\u00a0 Obama is also introducing a new $1 billion Race to the Top competition and a $55 million \u201cfirst in the world\u201d competition to reward states for improving efficiency and keeping down costs. Obama also plans to increase Perkins loans, a federal program providing low interest loans to help needy students finance the costs of postsecondary education, from $1 billion to $8 billion. All these measures will provide greater accessibility to college and will go a long way to alleviating this serious problem.</span></p> <p><span>Another aspect of Obama\u2019s plans for higher education involves releasing net costs, graduation rates, and employment information. Given the significant difficulty of paying off student debt, this information is important for students to consider when deciding which colleges they want to apply to and which courses of study to pursue. While we can understand the usefulness of such information, it is imperative that the government ensure that schools, while making these statistics available, don\u2019t use them to funnel students into particular majors or programs.\u00a0 There is a temptation when dealing with this sort of information to portray a college education as simply a means to earn more money when in reality it is much more than that, and provides graduates of college with myriad lifelong benefits unrelated to a higher starting salary or career advancement; the government must be careful when dispersing this information to note that you can\u2019t judge the value of a degree in dollars and cents.</span></p> <p><span>Obama\u2019s reforms are well intended and will have significant positive ramifications. They expand on his general proposals on education from his State of the Union speech and demonstrate his seriousness about tackling the vital issue of rising tuition and student loan rates.</span></p>"}

By itself, it is not the issue. The biggest determinant of teacher success or longevity is actually their principals and their peers.

Facing off against feminists, liberals, the new left, any enforcer of the politically correct, easy graders, and fresh young minds, Mansfield hasn\u2019t pulled any punches. He has been a vigorous opponent of the Ivory Tower\u2019s conventional wisdom. He\u2019s against race and gender-based affirmative action. He categorically opposes gender studies departments. He puts the Constitution on a pedestal. He thinks women, in general, should be expected to earn less than men. He wrote a book entitled \u201cManliness,\u201d a defense of traditional gender roles. In 2008, he hosted \u201cThe Conference the Radcliffe Institute Didn\u2019t Want to Host.\u201d He\u2019s an unyielding critic of grade inflation, earning the moniker Harvey \u201cC-minus\u201d Mansfield. He even opposed Harvard\u2019s course evaluation tool.</span></p> <p><span>You could call him a polemic. But then you might be missing the point.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSometimes I think if Harvard was just as conservative as it is liberal now, I wouldn\u2019t be a conservative,\u201d Mansfield reflects, eating a BLT with avocado and picking at greens instead of French fries\u2014even the great arbiter of manliness must bow to the requirements of old age.</span></p> <p><span>Harvey Mansfield entertaining the thought that he could be himself without being a conservative\u2014this idea seems pretty far from any regular conception of the Mansfieldian Platonic ideal. The words \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be a conservative\u201d come from the same person who minutes later labels himself a \u201cconservative Republican with the emphasis on Republican rather than conservative\u2014because I like to win.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The passing mention is not a half-hearted apology for decades spent as Harvard\u2019s head heretic. He is not apologizing. In fact, Harvey Mansfield is first and foremost a philosopher\u2014a man who has spent his career thinking about big ideas, a man who only half-jokingly lists John Rawls among his chief rivals. The idea of a Mansfield without conservative values is, like everything he touches, more complicated than it seems\u2014or maybe more complicated than he likes to let on. Perhaps after spending a lifetime studying Nietzsche and Machiavelli, he understands the joy of the aphorism, of the provocative remark.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI believe that Harvey is a provocateur, but I do not believe that Harvey is a superficial provocateur or an insincere one,\u201d says Sharon R. Krause, a left-leaning political science professor at Brown University and a former Harvard government department Ph.D. student advised and mentored by Mansfield. \u201cI believe that the position he defends, he believes he has good grounds for. But, he sees the limits of beliefs or convictions\u2014even convictions that he believes are sound.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mansfield might be a man driven by the primacy of his conservative values, but maybe it is the confrontation itself that has kept him fighting.</span></p> <p><span><b>***</b></span></p> <p><span>Mansfield was born March 21, 1932, in New Haven, Conn.

Almost without intention, but with plenty of passion, Mansfield immersed himself in the study of government\u2014describing himself as a \u201cgrind.\u201d As Mansfield, who went to a public high school, says he was a member of Harvard\u2019s first class to have equal numbers of men from prep schools and public schools, he revels in his own brand of diversity.</span></p> <p><span>After he graduated, he spent one year in England on a Fulbright scholarship and then two years as an enlisted man in the Army.</span></p> <p><span>He received his Ph.D. from Harvard in government in 1961, taught at Berkeley for a couple of years, and then returned to Harvard as a lecturer. In 1969, he was appointed a full professor; he chaired the government department from 1973 to 1976. Today, he is the William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of Government.</span></p> <p><span>During his time as an undergraduate, Mansfield was not yet a neo-conservative; he was a liberal. In a straw poll in the 1950s, he even voted for Adlai Stevenson.</span></p> <p><span>Then, in the late 1950s, Mansfield recalls\u2014employing a phrase coined by the neo-conservative thinker Irving Kristol\u2014getting \u201cmugged by reality.\u201d His transformation came in two parts. First, Mansfield discovered Leo Strauss, a Jewish-German political philosopher who has had a sustained impact on Mansfield\u2019s scholarship and worldview. Strauss\u2019 views on history and the classics naturally translated into a conservative school of thought, Mansfield says. Second, the protests that erupted in America and on Harvard\u2019s campus during the Vietnam War shaped his political perspective forever.</span></p> <p><span>Paul A. Cantor \u201966, an English professor at the University of Virginia who participated in a reading group led by Mansfield during his time at Harvard, says, \u201cWhen you had these various forms of student protest and politics suddenly intruding on academics, you suddenly had to take political positions because the students were forcing you to. Those events I wouldn\u2019t say politicized him as a teacher, but they made it necessary to make certain political positions.\u201d Cantor recalls, \u201cStudents would barge into your class and try to stop you from teaching.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mansfield kept teaching.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMany students refused to go to class after the American invasion of Cambodia, and Harvey Mansfield taught when many other faculty cancelled their classes,\u201d says Nathan Tarcov, who received his government Ph.D. at Harvard under Mansfield\u2019s mentorship.</span></p> <p><span><b>***</b></span></p> <p><span>Mansfield has kept teaching\u2014and researching, and writing\u2014for the past five decades, but he says he feels he has been passed over by the academic elite. He mentions, for one, that he\u2019s never been honored by the American Political Science Association. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me a whole lot because it goes with the territory,\u201d he says, referring to his conservative convictions and controversial stances.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think he has gotten less credit than he deserves...some of that is undoubtedly because of politics, some of it is because his work is difficult,\u201d says William Kristol \u201973, a preeminent Republican thinker and the founder of The Weekly Standard. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t pulled his punches. I don\u2019t just mean that in a political sense; I mean that in an intellectual sense.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s not that he\u2019s gone entirely unacknowledged, but that the plaudits have come almost exclusively from his fellow conservatives. He\u2019s been to the White House five times: once under Gerald Ford, twice under George H.W. Bush, and twice under George W. Bush. In 2004, he won the National Humanities Medal, and in 2007, he served as the Jefferson Lecturer in the Humanities\u2014\u201cthanks to George W. Bush.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Amidst academia\u2019s quest for diversity, Mansfield believes that the most important kind\u2014intellectual diversity\u2014has been forgotten. He says he watched the primacy of Western civilization evaporate. The classics have fallen off the canon. Great books are no longer considered indispensable in liberal arts institutions. He sees a government department that has little interest in studying the military or the minutiae of the Constitution. And to make matters worse, faculty members are more and more willing to coddle their students.</span></p> <p><span>Mansfield sees it as his mission to try to attract faculty members to Harvard who will question this \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d \u201cOne of the worst things about democracy is conformism,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI get angry,\u201d Mansfield says, breaking his calm and professorial speaking voice. He invokes his favorite foe, \u201cfeminists\u201d\u2014which he often applies as a catch-all term for his ideological opponents\u2014and splutters: \u201cThey\u2019re so intolerant.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But conservative academics are routinely overlooked by the University\u2014not on political grounds but because of their old school academic interests, he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re from another point of view, you probably study different things.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The problem transcends Harvard. Mansfield is routinely frustrated when his graduate students don\u2019t get appointments at other universities, and he bristles at the suggestion that this is because of anything other than a bias against their approach. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a feeling,\u201d he declares. \u201cIt\u2019s an observation.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mansfield wants Harvard to practice affirmative action for conservatives. \u201cI think a certain kind of affirmative action\u2014searching out, not quotas,\u201d he says. \u201cLooking out for people who are different from what we have.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Now with a barer plate in front of him, Mansfield has hit his stride. He cites Commencement speakers as another example of Harvard\u2019s prevailing liberal bias. Then he adds that Harvard Yard has only been shut down for two term-time speeches: Jesse Jackson and Al Gore \u201969.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard never gave an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher, the mightiest woman of our time,\u201d he rails.</span></p> <p><span><b>***</b></span></p> <p><span>He may consider himself first and foremost a political philosopher, but he\u2019s perhaps best known as an antagonist in an area in which he can claim no extensive pedigree: gender. He wrote the book \u201cManliness\u201d in 2006 and made an appearance on \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d to promote it.</span></p> <p><span>The book argues that men and women have inherent differences due to nature and social construction, and that they should remain different. He says it should be expected that women will earn less than men. He says that women will always be less focused on their careers than men: \u201cI do think they will always be less single-minded,\u201d he says. \u201cThey want a family in a way a man does not. I think most women think about being mothers, but a man doesn\u2019t think about being a father until he is one.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>His book was slammed in a New York Times book review. It also received strident criticism in a piece written by Martha C. Nussbaum, a political philosopher at the University of Chicago, appearing in The New Republic entitled \u201cMan Overboard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTo begin with, it is slipshod about facts\u2014even the facts that lie at the heart of his argument. He repeatedly tells us that \u2018all previous societies have been ruled by males,\u2019 producing Margaret Thatcher as a sole recent exception,\u201d writes Nussbaum in the article, proceeding to refute Mansfield\u2019s claim by citing more than two dozen female leaders missing from his tabulation, including politicians in New Zealand, Turkey, India, France, and Canada.</span></p> <p><span>But in typical Mansfield style, faced with a lengthy recitation of Nussbaum\u2019s critique, he says, \u201cNo, I think it\u2019s true: All previous societies have been ruled by men\u2014and Elizabeth. I\u2019ll add Queen Elizabeth to that,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s my concession.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>After some prodding that Nussbaum might be empirically correct, he says: \u201cThose are recent, and they\u2019re not significant.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ll stick with Margaret Thatcher,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>In the piece\u2019s conclusion, Nussbaum\u2014an esteemed political philosopher who has won a number of mainstream academic awards and honors\u2014writes that \u201cManliness\u201d has a \u201clack of definitional clarity,\u201d an \u201cideological enthusiasm,\u201d and \u201ca tendency to romanticize characters\u201d in a way that makes the book \u201cuncourageous, just when we badly need to think well about how to cultivate true courage.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Again, asked to respond, he pauses and takes his time to collect his thoughts. \u201cThe last thing Martha Nussbaum wants is true courage,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause true courage would be exercised against her very politically correct position.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cShe\u2019s a classical scholar and philosopher, and she paid no attention to my discussion of Plato and Aristotle in the last two chapters of the book,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Her piece does, in fact, address Plato and Aristotle. Whether it pays sufficient attention to his discussion is a question that seems unanswerable when faced with unyielding disagreement between two highly credentialed minds.</span></p> <p><span>For her part, Nussbaum writes in the article that Mansfield might not be the patient philosopher but instead be a familiar character from Plato\u2019s dialogues: the sophist. \u201cFar from seeking truth, the sophist seeks to put on a good show. Far from wanting premises that are correct, the sophist seeks premises that his chosen audience will find believable.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In \u201cManliness,\u201d Mansfield did not attempt to grapple with homosexuality. He says that he testified on behalf of the \u201canti-gay\u201d side in a Colorado court case, but that it\u2019s not really his issue. \u201cI don\u2019t care that deeply,\u201d he says about gay marriage. \u201cSome things are bigger problems than others.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Then, atypically, he acknowledges that social change has brought with it actual progress. He quietly mentions a gay classmate of his who committed suicide. \u201cIt\u2019s good that we don\u2019t treat gays in such a way that we used to,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span><b>***</b></span></p> <p><span>Mansfield does not look like somebody obsessed with manliness. You might have to lean in to hear exactly what he\u2019s saying. He never played varsity sports as an undergraduate. \u201cI\u2019m pretty small,\u201d he says. He is a fan of football (he tries to go to every home game), hockey, and basketball (about Jeremy Lin \u201910, he says, \u201cI\u2019m ruing the day that I never saw him play\u201d).</span></p> <p><span>He also played squash socially; Kristol recalls their time spent playing against each other: \u201cHe probably won more often than not.\u201d These days, Mansfield makes sure to walk down the stairs from his fourth floor office in the Center for Government and International Studies to get exercise. He looks spry for almost 80, but he\u2019ll need a hip replacement at the end of the spring semester.</span></p> <p><span>Mansfield is going on leave during the 2012-2013 school year. He has no plans to retire, but he says he\u2019s well aware that \u201csenility can sneak up on you.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mansfield drives a gray Porsche Boxster, and an old Lexus when he\u2019s going to get the groceries. He has been married three times. His first wife Margaret Dittson Mansfield, the mother of his three children, divorced him and later died in a 1989 automobile accident along with one of his children. He married Delba S. Winthrop, a professor at the Harvard Extension School, who died of cancer in 2006. He has since remarried again, this time to Anna Schmidt, whom he met in Munich during a research professorship there. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who opened the taxi door for me,\u201d he says, describing how the pair met.</span></p> <p><span>At Crema Caf\u00e9, Schmidt\u2014a 37-year-old with wavy hair, a fur coat, glasses, and too much energy for 9 a.m.\u2014says her husband is not exactly what you would expect from the author of \u201cManliness.\u201d When it comes to moving furniture around the house as they renovate the living room, she\u2019s the one doing any heavy lifting. And in debates\u2014which she typically instigates, rather than her more subdued husband\u2014she says she can hold her own. She\u2019s perhaps most critical of her husband not when he talks about feminism but when he spends too much time and energy watching sports.</span></p> <p><span>He is a man who is skeptical of anyone who claims to know truth. \u201cOne thing that makes me angry is open and aggressive atheism,\u201d he says. \u201cReligion can be aggressive if it makes you think God is always on your side.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Today, near 80, he calls himself \u201cjust only officially\u201d a Christian. \u201cI respect them,\u201d he says. But: \u201cIn practice I don\u2019t believe. In practice I\u2019m one of those two,\u201d he says, referring to atheism and agnosticism. \u201cPhilosophers as such are more likely to be skeptics.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He is a dapper dresser, wearing a coat jacket, a brimmed hat, and a colorful striped tie\u2014the kind that only old men seem to get away with. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best dressed people I know and he cares about it,\u201d says Jerry Weinberger, a political science professor at Michigan State University and a former government department graduate student mentored by Mansfield. \u201cHe\u2019s a gentleman. That\u2019s what he is, in all the best meanings of that term.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mansfield is old, but he is not a political relic. He says that he is not against social safety net, for instance; he just thinks it is too big and encompasses too much of the middle class. \u201cI\u2019m not a fanatic,\u201d he asserts.</span></p> <p><span>He has picked a candidate for the 2012 Republican nomination. \u201cI would support Romney as the best of what is being offered by the Republicans,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span><b>***</b></span></p> <p><span>While Mansfield\u2019s public persona is largely tied up in his political and social views, for many of his former students, those attitudes take a back seat to his qualities as a teacher.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI remember to this day his first lecture: It was so witty,\u201d says Kristol, who went on to get his government Ph.D. under Mansfield. He describes Mansfield\u2019s lectures as \u201ca very unusual combination of incredibly dense on the one hand and incredibly entertaining.\u201d The lectures, Kristol says, were broadly apolitical, but Mansfield took to \u201ctaunting the students to break out of their complacence\u201d\u2014an attribute lauded by many of Mansfield\u2019s former students.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHis seminars and lectures were always meticulously crafted; at least for me, they were always designed for and succeeded in prodding students to think through problems themselves. He expected you to learn. He expected you to stand on your own two intellectual feet,\u201d Weinberger says.</span></p> <p><span>Mansfield says that Harvard hasn\u2019t given him a single award\u2014except his 1993 Levenson Memorial Teaching Prize, from which he derives a healthy amount of pride. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m more of a teacher than most people are,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>He tends to score above the average for the social sciences on the Q course evaluation tool, the same tool he once outspokenly opposed. The comments on his course Government 1061: \u201cThe History of Modern Political Philosophy\u201d warn of a dense reading list\u2014Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau\u2014while at the same time offering whole-hearted endorsements.</span></p> <p><span>One comment reads: \u201cBe ready for a lot of reading, but if you are into deeper questions, you will really enjoy this course. It doesn\u2019t focus on details, but talks about the bigger questions of life and politics, and focuses on philosophizing instead of memorizing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mansfield teaches philosophical texts that are sometimes centuries old, and he tries to push students to consider the possibility that the claims in the texts are true. Unlike some philosophers who see a general march forward in intellectual thought, Mansfield pushes his students to consider the possibility that these ancient texts got it right\u2014and that maybe it was in the time that followed that people went astray.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe made these books speak for themselves. That\u2019s a great gift. It\u2019s in a way uncomfortable, because when these books speak for themselves, they shake you up,\u201d Weinberger says. \u201cEvery book that I studied with him, we took it seriously like it had been written yesterday.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>His fellow professor in the government department Michael E. Rosen says the reason for Mansfield\u2019s effectiveness as a teacher is obvious. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who\u2019s intensely engaged with individuals and text. You can tell this is someone who\u2019s read with extraordinary care and loves what he\u2019s reading,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Yet one would be remiss to describe Mansfield as a teacher without acknowledging his abilities as a performer. Mark Lilla, a professor at Columbia and former Harvard government graduate student mentored by Mansfield, fondly recalls his time spent in Mansfield\u2019s class. \u201cPolitical philosophy suddenly seemed urgent,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cAnd he was unbelievably droll. He liked making slightly racy or un-PC asides now and again, just for the fun of hearing the Harvard hiss return from the students (which meant they were awake).\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>***</b></span></p> <p><span>To truly understand Harvey C. Mansfield\u2014a man whose solution to grade inflation at Harvard is to give students one grade, the one they deserve, and then another, the ironic grade, which goes to the Registrar\u2014you have to realize that he tries to think outside history. Or, at least, he likes to pay a bit more deference to the old ways than the rest of us.</span></p> <p><span>His is an uncommon voice at Harvard, broadly opposing the notion that progress is for the better. \u201cSociety always takes things for granted,\u201d he says. \u201cIf one looks at modernity from the outside, one is not so impressed by the latest thing or the newest thing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps Mansfield stumbled into his role as provocateur by dint of his conservative worldview, but this script has become one that he acts out with both intellectual honesty and an understated self-awareness. No one will ever know for sure what Mansfield would be like at a conservative Harvard. In this world, however, he has become one of the most visible elements of intellectual life on campus. Some might say that his clamorous dissent has done more harm than good. On the other hand, even if his views lose out in the march of history, there\u2019s something to be said for Mansfield dragging his heels and throwing intellectual barbs along the way. Maybe it means that progress comes with more honesty.</span></p> <p><span>Mansfield recalls a time when the University of Chicago offered him a position on their faculty. Harvard\u2019s government department chair at the time asked Mansfield not to leave, calling him the department\u2019s balance. \u201cI don\u2019t count as diversity,\u201d he scoffs. \u201cI count as balance.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But despite his frustrations, he has a deep affection for Harvard and his many friends among the faculty. \u201cI love Harvard,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I have my quarrels.\u201d</span></p>"}

{"title": "In Defense of Snobbery | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word \u201csnob\u201d is of obscure origin, which accurately describes the thought process behind Rick Santorum\u2019s latest tirade against President Obama. In Troy, Michigan (I hear Helen was quite the snob) Rick Santorum called Obama the \u201cS word\u201d for suggesting that Obama \u201cwants everybody in America to go to college.\u201d According to Santorum, matriculation in university is akin to \u201cindoctrination,\u201d whereby young people lose their faith and become brainwashed Obama-bots. One of the most virulent attacks on higher education heard on a campaign trail this election cycle, Santorum\u2019s college-bashing is echoed in Mitt Romney\u2019s continued derisive references to the \u201cHarvard faculty lounge,\u201d which was supposedly a place he was unfamiliar with while pursuing a joint JD and MBA degree in Cambridge. But campaign cant aside, Santorum\u2019s broadside should make us all consider what exactly we do in college and why it is so important.</span></p> <p><span>Ideally, college should perform the inverse of the process Santorum describes. He sees it as a place where people lose faith and exchange one set of positive allegiances (religion, traditional values) for another (political liberalism, secularism). Santorum\u2019s critique of the university is not that it teaches dogmatism, but rather that it substitutes the wrong kind of faith for the one right one. But at its best, our colleges and universities do both much more and substantially less.\u00a0 It is often hard to specify or remember what exactly we learn in a lecture or tutorial, but we are changed by academic work. In focusing so exclusively on the content of university education, Santorum neglects the impact of its form. To say that we should aspire to be a country where \u201ceveryone goes to college\u201d is to insist that we try to be citizens who question rather than accept and challenge rather than parrot. As Andrew H. Delbanco \u201973 notes, \u201cin America there has been an impulse to slow things down, to extend the time for second chances and defer the day when determinative choices must be made.\u201d It might be argued that our network of institutions of higher education constitute one of this county\u2019s crowning achievements.</span></p> <p><span>To be sure, the history of exclusion and, yes, snobbery, runs deep in many of our universities; I am typing this editorial in Lowell House, whose namesake is synonymous with quotas of many pernicious kinds. But that is precisely why Santorum\u2019s dismissal is so problematic. As Lionel M. Trilling notes with regard to Rudyard Kipling, \u201che tempted liberals to be content with easy victories of right feeling and with moral self-congratulation.\u201d\u00a0 Santorum cedes too much ground when he gives up the university to those of a different political persuasion. In fact, some of the traditions that most resonantly contribute to his worldview have valued the importance of the specific kind of scholarship that intellectually, if not fiscally, funds universities. Catholic monks stewarded the glories of the Classical world into modernity. The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and, of course, Harvard, were all formed by men of faith.</span></p> <p><span>If today the texts studied are secular rather than sacred, that distinction is less important than the abiding practices of inquiry and intellectual habit.\u00a0 Universities are still our best bets for perpetuating the commitment to common cultural and artistic touchstones that are so important to the ongoing conversations we have with each other and ourselves. In Santorum\u2019s dichotomous worldview, there is no room for the complexity that the most \u201cconventional\u201d texts can exhibit or the sense of exhilarating strangeness that comes with encountering a new philosophy or vantage point. Santorum fears a young, impressionable student falling for Chomsky and Foner and Trotsky, but might not another young student see the wisdom in Burke\u2019s restraint, in Oakeshott\u2019s prose, in William F. Buckley\u2019s charm, or in Allan D. Bloom\u2019s formidable learning?</span></p> <p><span>Don\u2019t give up on colleges, Rick; we would all be poorer for that capitulation. And for those of us privileged to study, let us remember that we participate in an enterprise that needs defending and are responsible to a set of values and way of being in the world that needs a voice. Stand up for college and alongside all those who aspire to get there.\u00a0 If that makes you a snob, then I can think of no higher encomium (look it up!).</span></p> <p><span><i>Ari R.

This announcement has the potential to be a merely symbolic moment, a simple election-year scheme designed to appease environmentalists and budget hawks. However, it also has the potential to become a powerful victory for our country should we choose to answer our president\u2019s call to action and make his words reality.</span></p> <p><span>From any position on political spectrum, ending fossil fuel subsidies should be a policy to support. Most people would argue that subsidies can be smart investments\u2014assuming that they support industries which work in the public interest through the products they supply or jobs they provide.\u00a0 However, fossil fuel subsidies are a waste of money. Why should an average American give his or her money to an industry which already makes <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2008/07/31/news/companies/exxon_profits/index.htm\">record profits year after year</a>?\u00a0Beyond being a senseless fiscal decision, subsidising fossil fuels is dangerous.\u00a0Every year, <a href=\"http://www.betterfutureproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Energy-Casualties.pdf\">24,000 Americans die </a>because of toxic pollution from fossil fuel powerplants. By subsidizing fossil fuels, we pay to harm our own families. Fossil fuels are also a <a href=\"http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/emis/perlim_2009_2010_estimates.html\">major contributor</a> to climate change, which has health, agricultural, economic, and ecological consequences around the world. It is outrageous that the federal government wastes around $10 billion each year subsidizing a harmful industry already bloated with profits.</span></p> <p><span>It is particularly frustrating that our government is giving money to already-profitable corporations at a time when there are many other pressing issues crying for financial support. Those billions of dollars given to fossil fuel corporations could be used to help pay off our national debt. They could provide tax relief to struggling American families. \u00a0The money could be used to upgrade our public transport systems, like the seriously-troubled<a href=\"http://boston.cbslocal.com/2012/02/14/mass-lawmakers-pressured-on-planned-mbta-hikes/\"> MBTA</a>, which would have the additional benefit of reducing dependence on automobiles. Or it could be invested in shovel-ready renewable energy projects which would create thousands of jobs, like <a href=\"http://www.capewind.org/article24.htm\">Cape Wind</a> or clean-tech infrastructure. There are many productive uses for those billions of dollars\u2014but supporting dangerous energy corporations which already earn record profits is not one of them.</span></p> <p><span>Critics may argue that fossil fuel subsidies are necessary to protect consumers from high gas prices. However, this is false reasoning\u2014<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/28/opinion/sanders-gas-speculation/index.html\">oil prices are not a simple issue of supply and demand</a>.\u00a0 According to the Energy Information Administration, supply is higher than it was three years ago, when gas cost $1.90. An oil boom in North Dakota is expected to push US crude output this year to its highest level since 1999\u2014and yet the price of gas is expected to hit the roof. These rocketing prices come, in fact, <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/blame_wall_street_for_all_your_bad_YCkqoa8VYaru8QmZYWtt5H\">from Wall Street</a> trading of gasoline futures contracts, which are basicallly bets on where gas prices are going to be. Elimintating fossil fuel subsidies will not affect the real forces which drive the prices at the pump.</span></p> <p><span>Some may argue that if we eliminate fossil fuel subsidies, we should also cut back on renewable subsidies in the interests of fairness. This is false logic. Firstly, there is a belief that taxpayer money can and should be spent on initiatives that work in the taxpayer\u2019s interest\u2014clean and safe renewable energy is in the public interest and worth taxpayer support through subsidies. Secondly, subsidies on fossil fuels do not serve to level the playing field, so removing them would only help to lessen the distortion. Fossil fuels have the tremendous advantage of externalizing immense costs of production to the public, which makes them appear cheaper than they really are. If fossil fuel corporations actually paid for the healthcare bills and economic losses which result from their pollution, fossil fuel energy would be far more expensive than clean and safe renewable energy. It is also worth noting that fossil fuel subsidies today are far greater than renewable energy subsidies\u2014between 2002 and 2008, <a href=\"http://www.eli.org/Program_Areas/innovation_governance_energy.cfm\">the government gave $72 billion to the fossil fuel industry compared to just $29 billion for renewable energy investments</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Now is the time to step up and answer our president\u2019s call to stop supporting a dangerous industry. Do you have two minutes of free time today? \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.house.gov/representatives/\">Call your representatives </a>and <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm\">your senators</a>, and ask them to take action in the next two weeks to remove fossil fuel subsidies from the 2013 budget.</span></p> <p><span>This is our country, and it is our duty to see that our money is spent wisely. We must stand up for a safe, healthy future. Will you make that phone call?</span></p> <p><span><i>Chloe S. Maxmin \u201815, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Wigglesworth Hall. Alli J.

{"title": "Polarization Problems | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>This past January, President Obama stated that the state of our union is and always will be strong. With an improving yet still ailing economy and bleak budget outlooks for the future, some may disagree. What nearly every American and politician agrees upon, however, is that the state of our politics is weak. The strong reaction to the miraculous recovery of Representative Gabrielle D. Giffords showed, if anything, that most Americans and members of Congress wish that the government could work better for its people. Despite the good intentions of many individuals\u2014from the Bowles-Simpson Commission to the Senate Gang of Six\u2014politics in America remains unnecessarily polarized. If gridlock remains despite the willingness of significant party members and committee leaders to work together, perhaps we as Americans have been looking for the problem in all of the wrong places. Polarization in America is not a result of disagreements over solutions; it is a serious dispute over what the problems actually are.</span></p> <p><span>If Americans remember one thing about their government from the summer, it is the fierce and drawn-out debate over the debt ceiling and fiscal future of the United States. Approximately six months later however, the president seems to have forgotten. He\u2019s been fighting against Congress for six months, but he won\u2019t even mention what they were fighting about. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/state-of-the-union-2012-obama-speech-excerpts/2012/01/24/gIQA9D3QOQ_story.html\">In the State of the Union address</a>, the big three entitlement programs\u2014Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security\u2014received one mention in a speech that lasted well over one hour, despite the fact that they are <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/topics/budget/long-term-budget-projections\">the largest drivers of the federal debt by a wide margin</a>. In the Republican response<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/us/politics/gov-mitch-daniels-republican-address-to-the-nation.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\">, it took Governor Mitch E. Daniels (R-IN) a mere few minutes </a>to point out the glaring omission: \u201cSo 2012 is a year of true opportunity, maybe our last, to restore an America of hope and upward mobility, and greater equality. The challenges aren\u2019t matters of ideology, or party preference; the problems are simply mathematical, and the answers are purely practical.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>On the issue of entitlement reform and truly placing the nation on a path to fiscal sustainability, Republicans have kept their word. Last April, Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-WI) introduced<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703806304576242612172357504.html\"> a plan to reduce the federal deficit</a> by $6.2 trillion over the next ten years and reform welfare and entitlement programs to bring future spending under control and preserve the programs for the future. In response, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/28/opinion/28nocera.html?_r=1\">Democrats accused Ryan of throwing grandma off the cliff</a> and gleefully used the plan <a href=\"http://maddowblog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/05/24/6711669-democrat-wins-ny-26-first-election-since-ryans-medicare-plan\">to pummel Republicans in a special congressional election in New York</a>. Ryan tried again, this time <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/paul-ryan-ron-wyden-bipartisan-medicare-reform/2011/12/15/gIQAx7xyvO_blog.html\">introducing a bipartisan Medicare reform plan </a>with Senator Ron L. Wyden (D-OR) that offered both more choices for seniors and means testing programs, which determine eligibility based on each recipient\u2019s wealth. The White House, Democratic leaders, and liberal advocacy groups once again <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/medicare/199805-overnight-health-ryanwyden-medicare-plan-panned\">flatly rejected the proposal</a>. When Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) introduced<a href=\"http://blog.heritage.org/2011/06/21/from-sen-hutchinson-another-opportunity-for-congress-to-save-social-security/\"> a plan to reform Social Security</a> that would prevent drastic cuts as it depletes its funds over the next 20 years, Democrats and Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-NV) refused to consider it.</span></p> <p><span>After two Republican proposals and at least one bipartisan proposal, Democrats have yet to put forward even one solution to the entitlement crisis that currently threatens to engulf the nation. <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/175963-pelosi-vows-to-protect-medicare-medicaid-social-security-from-cuts\">Rep. Nancy P. D. Pelosi has vowed </a>to fight against any attempt to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Sen. Reid called Social Security<a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/03/28/harry-reids-social-security-lie.html\"> \u201cthe most successful social program in the history of the world,\u201d</a> yet he proposed nothing to save it. President Obama has done little but attack Republicans for even touching the programs. Under the president\u2019s 2013 budget plan, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the economy <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/291315/corpsing-mark-steyn\">will completely shut down in 2027</a> because of the sheer size of the debt. The Democratic Party has essentially announced that its policy is to deny reality. Medicare will be bankrupt in less than nine years. The economy will collapse in 15 years, and, if we somehow survive Obama\u2019s budget projections, Social Security will cut all benefits by nearly 25 percent in 20 years if nothing is done. Currently, <a href=\"http://www.candidatebriefing.com/entitlements/\">the entitlement programs have promised $46 trillion in benefits that they cannot pay for</a>, and the figure worsens every year that nothing is done. If Democrats want to pay for these with increased taxes on the 1 percent, they better hope that the wealthy get a lot richer, and quickly. For every year that the status quo remains, the situation worsens, and the possible solutions shrink in number.</span></p> <p><span>By refusing to recognize the true financial state of the union, Democrats have created the paralyzing partisanship that they so frequently complain about. Republicans have come forward with solutions for the American people and have displayed willingness to compromise, but compromise assumes that the opposite side has a position with which one can compromise. Democrats not only lack solutions, but they also willingly remain ignorant of perhaps the greatest threat to the future of the nation for their own temporary political gain. Ending polarization doesn\u2019t require any complicated reforms; all it requires is for one side to open its eyes to reality and come forward with its own solutions. The adults in the room are waiting.</span></p> <p><span><i>Derek J. Bekebrede \u201913 is an economics concentrator in Winthrop House. His column appears on alternate Tuesdays.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "War and the Israel Lobby | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>On March 4, President Obama <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/04/remarks-president-aipac-policy-conference-0\">warned</a> thousands of members of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that excessive talk of war would only benefit Iran and hurt Israel and America. However, he assured AIPAC that he would take a strong stance against Iran, even resorting to military action as a last resort. Obama is right to take a firm but even-handed stance against Iran, a country which has consistently destabilized regional peace. However, Iran does not pose a legitimate threat to Israel, a country with the military might to handle a hypothetical Iranian attack without the help of the U.S. The growing sound of drumbeats on Capitol Hill over Iran is a symptom of the influence of the Israel lobby rather than the demands of the situation at hand, and the U.S. should avoid getting involved in a potential war with Iran at all costs.</span></p> <p><span>Iran\u2019s bark is surely louder than its bite. For one, the country has failed to prove itself militarily. Its apparent assassination attempts on Israeli agents <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/15/bangkok-assassins-not-terrorists-official\">failed</a> catastrophically, with every participant in the affair apprehended before a single Israeli was harmed. Furthermore, although it may not be immediately apparent, sanctions on Iran have been effective. The Iranian rial has <a href=\"http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/01/23/190110.html\">plummeted</a>, losing half its value since December 2011, the same month that President Ahmadinejad admitted to Iran\u2019s parliament that the country was segregated from the international banking system. Rising food and gasoline prices have been a problem since early 2010, when the Iranian government <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/31/world/la-fg-iran-subsidies-20101031\">cut</a> food and gasoline subsidies substantially due to economic difficulties.\u00a0 The recent sanctions enacted by America and the European Union in light of the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s troubling report, which are estimated to cut Iran\u2019s oil exports\u2014themselves accounting for an estimated <a href=\"../Local%20Settings/Temp/iranprimer.usip.org/resource/oil-and-gas-industry\">65 percent</a>of the Iranian government\u2019s revenues\u2014by <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21548235\">60 percent.</a> These economic difficulties are being felt by Iran\u2019s general public: <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/153002/Opinion-Briefing-Iranians-Outlook-Relations.aspx\">65 percent</a> of Iranians worried about the current sanctions affecting their lives a \u201cgreat deal\u201d or \u201csomewhat.\u201d Iran\u2019s inflation also remains high at <a href=\"http://www.menafn.com/qn_news_story_s.asp?storyid=1093489651\">21 percent.</a> Clearly Iran is in no military or economic position to attack Israel. Allowing war rhetoric to dominate diplomatic strategy in the Middle East will only drive the Iranian people to favor their government even more in the face of foreign adversity and increase the likelihood of an Iranian pre-emptive strike.</span></p> <p><span>On the other hand, Israel has demonstrated its military might countless times since its inception, crushing opposition in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and Lebanon in the past decade alone. Not only does this demonstrate Israel\u2019s obvious resilience against a weaker opponent, it also raises another question: Is Iran the only country in the Middle East whose belligerent militarism should be worrying the United   States right now? Although Iran is belligerent and weak, Israel is belligerent and terrifyingly strong.</span></p> <p><span>But if the threat of Iran is indeed so minimal and Israel is more than capable of handling the situation, where is all this war talk coming from in the U.S.? The Israel lobby has maintained a prominent presence in Washington  D.C., with lobbying groups such as the aforementioned AIPAC responsible for providing <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Israel-Lobby-U-S-Foreign-Policy/dp/0374177724\">significant funding</a> to the campaigns of countless congressmen, governors, and even presidents. The addition or subtraction of support from this powerful lobby can <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Israel-Lobby-U-S-Foreign-Policy/dp/0374177724\">literally</a> mean the birth or death of a political career. A number of powerful members of the Israel lobby have come out wholeheartedly in favor of U.S. intervention in the situation. It comes with no surprise that Mitt Romney, who has also been invited to speak at AIPAC conference, has <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/04/10576764-romney-if-obama-is-reelected-iran-will-get-a-nuclear-weapon\">stated </a>\u201cIf\u00a0<a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" title=\"More articles about Barack Obama\">Barack Obama</a> gets re-elected, Iran will have a nuclear weapon, and the world will change if that\u2019s the case.\u201d Republican candidates Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich have also been invited to speak at the conference. The pressure for the U.S. to intervene in an issue in which it has very little, if any, involvement stems almost solely from political pressures rather than from U.S. interests in the conflict. Surely we should pay more attention to the situation at hand rather than the war mongering of lobbying groups.</span></p> <p><span>Iran poses little threat to Israel and it is highly unlikely that its nuclear program will turn into a full-fledged attack against Israel. Israel is more than capable to launch a pre-emptive attack and does not need America\u2019s help should it decide to do so. Ultimately, the U.S. should resist the influence of the Israel lobby and try to stay out of this sticky situation. If anything, there are more pressing matters in the Middle East than the overhyped tensions between Israel and Iran.</span></p> <p><span><i>Heather L.

M. \u201cTrey\u201d Grayson \u201994 said of Tuesday\u2019s results. \u201cRomney\u2019s still a frontrunner, but he\u2019s a very weak one.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The story is a familiar one, pundits said. Romney has been the assumed Republican frontrunner since the primary process began in January, yet he has failed at nearly every step to convince party voters he should be their representative on the national stage.The tone at Tuesday\u2019s election night event was upbeat, with a crowd of supporters young and old chanting \u201cWe want Mitt! We want Mitt!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Flanked by his wife and grandchildren, an energized Romney addressed a\u00a0group of former constituents, thanking them for his victories thus far and reflecting on the weeks and months to come until the general election.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie; it\u2019s been a long road to Super Tuesday,\u201d Romney told his supporters.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere will be good days and bad days, always long hours and never enough time. But on November 6, we will stand united\u2014not only having won an election but having saved a future,\u201d he added.</span></p> <p><span>Super Tuesday is considered the biggest test of the primary season to date. A total of 419 delegates were up for grabs nationwide on Tuesday\u2014a little more than a third of 1,144 needed to earn the Republican nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Analysts said that Romney\u2019s indecisive showing, coupled with Santorum\u2019s continued strong performance, will likely draw the race out well into June.</span></p> <p><span>In the absence of key victories, the night was about Massachusetts. Romney\u2019s speech at the Westin Hotel in downtown Boston marked the first time the candidate has been home in two months. Though energized when talking to the crowd, he looked physically tired, with his eyes downcast or lost in the room, as his wife Ann addressed the crowd.</span></p> <p><span>Romney won in Massachusetts by a landslide, taking home over 70 percent of the vote and all of the state\u2019s 41 delegates.</span></p> <p><span>Romney\u2019s victory in his home state was expected by analysts, who said anything short of a blowout here would have been a major disappointment to the campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Romney served as governor of the state from 2003 to 2007 and is a graduate of Harvard Law and Business School.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s a coronation of Mitt in his main home state,\u201d Republican consultant Todd Domke wrote in an email before the vote tallies came in. \u201cThe other candidates didn\u2019t contest him here, so the outcome has never been in question.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Nicholas P.

{"title": "The Cards and How You Play Them | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>There once was a president who proposed a national <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Tragedy-Child-Care-America-ebook/dp/B0024NLHSU\">government-run daycare</a> program, a universal health care plan <a href=\"http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Checking-In-With/stuart-altman.aspx\">almost identical</a> to the one eventually passed in 2010, and a <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8548.html\">guaranteed minimum income</a> for all Americans. What\u2019s more, he got all those measures\u2014which, taken together, would have transformed the US into a bona fide, Western European-style social democracy\u2014reasonably close to passage. He oversaw major Constitutional reform measures, including the lowering of the voting age to 18 and the passage by Congress of the Equal Rights Amendment, which banned discrimination on the basis of sex. He created the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupation Safety and Health Administration and signed the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act into law.</span></p> <p><span>If you read enough articles like this one, you know that the president in question isn\u2019t Franklin D. Roosevelt, class of 1904, or Lyndon B. Johnson, or anyone else you\u2019d expect; that\u2019d be too easy. No, it was Richard M. Nixon, enemy number one of the left for upwards of a decade and also the person who came closest to closing the gap between the American welfare state and those of all other developed nations. The fact that we cannot even imagine a conservative Republican advocating policies remotely similar today can tell us a lot about what has happened to U.S. politics since the 1970s. And the fact that Nixon failed in bringing the U.S. in line with its peer nations can tell us a lot about how hard it is to make real progress even when the fundamentals are on the side of change.</span></p> <p><span>Today, it\u2019s hard to imagine even a Democrat proposing some of Nixon\u2019s agenda. A guaranteed minimum income would be laughed off the table, a silly proposal to give people an excuse to bum around and not work, rather than the <a href=\"http://bostonreview.net/BR25.5/vanparijs.html\">devilishly</a> effective <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,642310,00.html\">anti-poverty measure</a> it is. So what happened? Basically, the parties got more ideologically polarized, and the Republicans got much more conservative than the Democrats got liberal. As Jacob Hacker <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/30/120130fa_fact_lizza?currentPage=all\">explained</a> to The New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza, since 1975 Senate Republicans went twice as far to the right as Senate Democrats went to the left, and House Republican went six times as far to the right as House Democrats went to the left. The end result was that the political center shifted significantly rightward.</span></p> <p><span>So we\u2019re left with a Democratic president whose domestic agenda is less ambitious than that of a Republican president from three decades ago and a Republican opposition that decries that same agenda as rank socialism. No matter how well Obama plays his cards, the fact remains that he\u2019s been dealt a terrible hand, and it would take reversing a generation-long national shift in political culture to change that. Obama could throw his heart and soul into a guaranteed minimum income proposal and it wouldn\u2019t get half the momentum it did when Nixon pushed one.</span></p> <p><span>But playing your cards well still matters, and advocates for a more generous welfare state played their cards really, really terribly in the 1970s. The man who killed Nixon\u2019s health care plan was not a free market conservative but Senator Ted Kennedy \u201956, who, preferring a single-payer approach, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/27/AR2009082703919.html\">decried</a> the Nixon proposal as little more than corporate welfare. Kennedy\u2019s last fight, of course, would be pushing for passage of the Affordable Care Act, which shares most of its structure with the Nixon plan.</span></p> <p><span>The death of Nixon\u2019s childcare efforts was even more bizarre. As Edward F. Zigler, the administration\u2019s head advisor on childcare, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Tragedy-Child-Care-America-ebook/dp/B0024NLHSU\">explains</a> in his excellent book, \u201cThe Tragedy of Child Care in America,\u201d Nixon first proposed a program to be run as a partnership between states and the federal government. But civil rights advocates like Marian Wright Edelman killed that plan for fear of increasing the power of segregationist state governors, preferring instead a technically unworkable plan that would have had the federal government coordinate childcare with thousands of individual municipalities. Their lobbying, combined with opposition from the religious right, ended up killing the effort entirely.</span></p> <p><span>Changing the fundamentals is important, but how you perform given those fundamentals matters tremendously, as well. The fundamentals for health care reform were orders of magnitude better in the Nixon administration than they were in the first years of Obama\u2019s tenure, and yet Obama got it done while Nixon failed. The difference was that liberals in 2010 knew how to take a win and liberals in 1974 didn\u2019t. The day-in, day-out tactical dance of legislating is boring, disheartening stuff. But getting it right could not be more important.</span></p> <p><span><i>Dylan R. Matthews\u00a0\u201912, a Crimson editorial writer, is a social studies concentrator in Kirkland House.

{"title": "Help Me, Rick Santorum | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Like many of my fellow Harvard students, I have been appalled by several of your recent deeply misinformed comments about liberal arts colleges. In January, for example, you accused President Obama of encouraging kids to attend college <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57366219-503544/rick-santorum-left-uses-college-for-indoctrination/\">because</a> the \u201cindoctrination that occurs in American universities\u201d is how the left holds power in America. You said that Obama\u2019s push for higher education is nothing more than an attempt for the president to <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/27/obama-defends-college-remarks/\">\u201cremake\u201d</a> our nation\u2019s youth in his own image. You\u2019ve painted a nightmarish picture of our American universities as <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/santorum-says-religion-and-conservative-principles-are-at-risk/\">\u201cindoctrination mills\u201d</a> run by liberal professors, plagued by an atheistic spirit where students lose their religion due to \u201cpolitically correct left\u201d professors.</span></p> <p><span>I am writing to tell you that these claims are wild, ignorant exaggerations. Over the course of my few years at Harvard, I have come to discover a wonderful, vibrant campus that values freedom of expression and diverse viewpoints. We are taught to think independently here at Harvard, rather than simply to follow the herd. Heck, our introduction to economics class is even taught by a former advisor to President George W. Bush! Furthermore, contrary to your claim that colleges are bastions of anti-religious sentiment, the center of our campus is the austere and awe-inspiring Memorial Church, which emphasizes the profound contribution of religion to the fabric of the Harvard community.</span></p> <p><span>And furthermore\u2026um\u2026and furthermore\u2026</span></p> <p><span>(\u2026Are they gone? I think they\u2019re gone. Oh, thank God.)</span></p> <p><span>Rick, you\u2019ve got to help me. Everything you\u2019ve been saying about liberal indoctrination? The godlessness? It\u2019s true\u2014all of it. Don\u2019t believe anything they tell you\u2014Harvard\u2019s been keeping me trapped here and brainwashing me.</span></p> <p><span>Oh, sure, everything started off great. Then there were the little things. Like the time that my resident dean caught me reading the Bible and gave me a copy of \u201cRules for Radicals\u201d instead. Or the time my tutor saw me reading an article from Fox News on my laptop and proceeded to smash my computer while berating me for not remembering that \u201cRed is the new Crimson.\u201d You know, nothing major. I was told to expect college life to be a bit different than high school, so I thought nothing of it.</span></p> <p><span>But then they started mandating these University-wide 7 a.m. salutes to Obama, and Rick, that\u2019s when I really started getting suspicious. Now every day they make us stand outside in the cold now wearing these brown shirts and make us say these meaningless phrases over and over again. \u201cFalse consciousness.\u201d \u201cPoststructuralism.\u201d \u201cUniversal Health Care.\u201d All nonsense. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can take this.</span></p> <p><span>Oh, sure, Harvard\u2019s apologists like to tell people that a church sits at the center of its campus. But have you ever been inside Memorial Church, Rick? All the crucifixes are upside down and there\u2019s a shrine to some guy named Baal at the front of the room. All likenesses of Jesus have been plastered over with photos of Howard Zinn. Hell, I only manage to get exempted from the weekly orgies (also known as \u201cSunday Services\u201d) because I have asthma problems.<a href=\"#_msocom_1\"></a></span></p> <p><span>I haven\u2019t eaten real food in months. They don\u2019t allow meat anywhere on this campus. If you so much as bring a piece of chicken within a fifty-foot radius of a Harvard building, they lock you in a human-sized cage and poke you with a stick. \u201cHow do you like it, huh?\u201d they say as they poke you. \u201cHow do you like it?\u201d I can\u2019t eat any more hemp cereal, Rick, and I\u2019m sick of these vegan turkey legs, too\u2014these people are trying to kill me.\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"#_msocom_2\"></a></span></p> <p><span>So they bring up Greg Mankiw? Have you ever actually opened Mankiw\u2019s textbook, Rick? It\u2019s, like, six pages of supply-and-demand charts and the rest is plagiarized directly from the original German version of Das Kapital. It\u2019s a farce, Mr. Santorum. If you even utter the phrase \u201cregressive tax\u201d at Harvard, the administration grabs you and throws you into a cellar underneath Lamont where you\u2019re forced to watch a Paul R. Krugman video on repeat for days on end while Occupy Harvard protesters throw tomatoes at you. Now my friend can\u2019t even say the words \u201csupply-side economics\u201d without vomiting.</span></p> <p><span>I need to wrap this letter up quickly\u2014there\u2019s smoke in my eyes from the Yard bonfire where all the students are burning their draft cards (there isn\u2019t even a draft right now, Rick! What the hell are they burning?!). But this is a desperate plea for help, Mr. Santorum. I need you and all of your supporters to help beat Mitt Romney and take down Obama so that we can stop this madness. Together, we can reclaim liberal arts colleges for the sane few of us remaining in this country. Fight the power! Take back the campus! We are the 99 percent! We are the 99 percent! We are the 99 percent!</span></p> <p><span>Oh, dear God. It\u2019s\u2026starting\u2026already\u2026</span></p> <p><span><i>Avishai D.

Frank pulled about 54 percent of the vote to Bielat\u2019s 43 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Frank decide to retire after more than 30 years in office in the wake of redistricting that brought a large number of Republicans into his traditionally Democratic district.</span></p> <p><span>Childs announced her bid for the Fourth Congressional seat in July 2011 but was eclipsed by Bielat and by Democrat Joseph P. Kennedy III, who announced his interest in the seat in January.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cElizabeth Childs certainly has a good reason to feel pleased. However, this will be a long race, and Sean Bielat will get his endorsements,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI expect it will be a very competitive primary.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bielat is considered by most political analysts to be the frontrunner for the Republican nomination this time around, but a poll taken in January showed Kennedy with a two-to-one lead over Bielat.</span></p> <p><span>Childs said that as an independent-minded Republican, she is better positioned to appeal to her district\u2019s voters.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI do think that I\u2019m a real contrast with Sean Bielat and Joseph Kennedy, and the whole point of democracy is to give people options,\u201d Childs said in an interview in late January. \u201cOnly voters can change the course of the country....

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last night, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney sat down for a third and final presidential debate before election day. Although the close proximity of the candidates and moderator Bob Schieffer didn't quite produce the verbal fireworks we saw between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan when they were seated in the same format two weeks ago, we did hear quite a lot from both sides of the table (literally). Fortunately, Flyby stayed alert and on BS-patrol. For one last time, we're back to help you sort through some of the evening's more memorable moments.</span></p> <p><span>1. Romney: \"Promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America. We didn't ask for it. But it's an honor that we have it.\"</span></p> <p><span>You're right, Mitt. In fact, we told them that's how it was <a href=\"http://www.ushistory.org/us/3c.asp\">gonna be</a>. Thanks, John Winthrop.</span></p> <p><span>2. Obama: \"If we're going to talk about trips that we've taken\u2026\"</span></p> <p><span>Yeah, about that. Afghanistan in '01 and Iraq in '03 never did quite top <a href=\"http://5ones.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/obama-surf.jpg\">Hawaii '08.</a></span></p> <p><span>3. Schieffer: \"Obama's bin Laden.\"</span></p> <p><span><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/22/schieffer-oops-obamas-bin-laden/\">Oof,</a> Bob. This guy's been president for the last four years, not hiding out in the mountains of Pakistan. We know you were born in 1937, but get it together.</span></p> <p><span>4. Obama: \"Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines. And so the question is not a game of Battleship where we're counting ships.\"</span></p> <p><span>There goes the Hasbro endorsement, Mr. President\u2014you just sunk that battleship.</span></p> <p><span>5. Side note: Flyby supports breast cancer research (and we definitely give Obama props for mixing up the red and blue sartorial scheme with a pop of <a href=\"http://seattletimes.com/html/politics/2019492688_apuspresidentialcampaignwomenvoters.html\">pink</a>), but if you want to do wristbands right, we suggest taking a page from the Romney <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2012/10/romney-friday-night-lights-bracelets.html\">playbook</a>.</span></p> <p><span>6. Schleiffer: \"I think we all love teachers.\"</span></p> <p><span>Preach, Bob. Still, we can't help but feel that this comment fed into the candidates' seeming misconception that this foreign policy debate was actually all about education.</span></p> <p><span>7. Obama: \"What we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership.\" And later: \"America is a pacific power and we're going to have a presence there.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bonus points for pulling out the alliteration in full force. But even if Romney kept his word choice squarely within the realm of the (third-grade) vernacular (see: \"bad guys\"), at least we know he's read his Robert Frost\u2026</span></p> <p><span>8. Romney: \"There are two very different paths the country can take. One is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean we'd have $20 trillion in debt heading towards Greece. I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.\"</span></p> <p><span>Which will be your road less traveled? Perhaps the one that runs somewhere between Appleton and Philadelphia?\u2026</span></p> <p><span>9. Romney: \"I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin. I met a young woman in \u2014 in Philadelphia who's coming out of \u2014 out of college, can't find work.

But before the candidates give their opening arguments, here are five things we wouldn't mind seeing tonight, based on some of the most notable debate moments of years past.</span></p> <p><span><b>A One-Sided Train Wreck</b></span></p> <p><span>During the very first televised debate in 1960, Richard Nixon set the standard for how to look like a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbrcRKqLSRw\">hot mess.</a> In reality, he was more of a cold, clammy, perspiring mess, and it didn't help that his opponent, John F. Kennedy '40, looked like cool combination of Cary Grant and a Ken doll.</span></p> <p><span><b> </b></span></p> <p><span><b>Faulty Information</b></span></p> <p><span><b> </b></span></p> <p><span>Nothing is more fascinating or troubling than watching a candidate try to fudge the facts, and nothing quite compares to Gerald Ford's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfyL4uQVJLw\">declaration</a> during a 1976 debate that, \"There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.\" Moderator Max Frankel's befuddled response (\"I'm sorry, what?...\") says it all.</span></p> <p><span><b> </b></span></p> <p><span><b>Historical Allusions</b></span></p> <p><span>Digging up the past always spices up a debate, especially when the past comes back and bites you in the butt. A certain Senator Dan \"Potatoe\" Quayle learned this lesson all too well during the 1988 Vice Presidential debate. When Quayle, comparing his youthful self to John F. Kennedy, tried to school opponent Lloyd Bentsen on the older senator's own period of history, Bentsen had <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRCWbFFRpnY\">a few words</a> for the young grasshopper: \"Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Awkwardness</b></span></p> <p><span><b> </b></span></p> <p><span><b> </b>The Harvard hug that never was? We're not quite sure what exactly Al Gore '69 was going for when he abruptly stood up and approached George W. Bush (HBS '75) during a 2000 presidential debate\u2014maybe he was looking to share some Crimson loving with his opponent? We hope tonight's debaters will have better luck. The president's track record with\u00a0<a href=\"http://images.politico.com/global/2012/09/120905_clinton_obama_hug_jlee_605.jpg\">middle aged</a> <a href=\"http://www.chow.com/blog-media/2012/09/hug-460.jpg\">white guys</a> seems to be in Mr. Romney's favor.</span></p> <p><span><b> </b></span></p> <p><span><b>A Little Bit of Sass</b></span></p> <p><span>You could say that then-Senator Barack Obama started it when he told Hillary Clinton that she was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3DeCLPwxXI\">\"likable enough\"</a> during a January 2008 primary debate. But when Obama was called to defend himself against accusations that he had plagiarized parts of his speeches, Clinton wasted no time in\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq2AEwFtPEA&amp;feature=related\">dishing out</a> a memorable, \"That's not change you can believe in, that's change you can Xerox.\" Obama didn't appreciate the swipe, but we hear he's doing all right these days. Clinton, for her part, may not have won the election, but four years later, she's Secretary of State and arguably a lot more\u00a0<a href=\"http://textsfromhillaryclinton.tumblr.com/\">likable</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of what happens tonight, things are bound to go better than they did in 1940, when Republican candidate Wendell Willkie challenged Franklin D. Roosevelt '04 to a debate and was promptly rejected by the President. Some things (like a President Wendell Willkie) just aren't meant to be.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Technocrats to the Rescue | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Nearly four years after the start of the financial crisis, unemployment remains high and business investment is slowing. The housing sector appears to finally be sputtering back to life, but America is still waiting for a sustained recovery.</span></p> <p><span>So what are our leaders doing about it? Largely nothing.</span></p> <p><span>In a country with all the economic tools to give a serious pick-me-up to its slow economy, most of the key players are sitting on their hands or actively making things worse. Congress has blocked the President\u2019s jobs plan and is actually cutting spending before the economy has recovered.</span></p> <p><span>And so America, finding its democratic institutions incapable of responding to economic sluggishness, turns to its resident technocrats at the Federal Reserve. On September 13, the Fed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/14/business/economy/fed-announces-new-round-of-bond-buying-to-spur-growth.html?pagewanted=all\">announced</a> a new round of monetary stimulus in which it would buy billions of dollars in long-term assets and mortgage-backed securities to drive down long-term interest rates, including mortgages.</span></p> <p><span>Past rounds of stimulus have had specific end-points, limiting their impact. In a significant shift, the Fed said this time its commitment to asset purchases would be open-ended. The Fed will continue the stimulus not just until the labor market improves \u201csubstantially,\u201d but \u201cfor a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.\u201d In effect, the Fed is making clear that it isn\u2019t joking around this time.</span></p> <p><span>Which is nice to hear, because looking at Capitol Hill, you get the impression that our leaders think they\u2019re playing a game in which reelection is the only goal and actually helping the economy is something nice to do if you can get around to it.</span></p> <p><span>Current fiscal policy is wildly inappropriate, combining short-term tightening during a weak economy with inaction on our serious long-term federal shortfall. Congress hasn\u2019t passed a significant stimulus bill since 2009. In fact, Congress itself has managed to create one of the gravest threats to the recovery with the fiscal cliff, which we continue to blithely sail towards. Meanwhile, leaders in both parties position themselves for political advantage in the inevitable national crisis at the end of this year instead of working to defuse the time bomb.</span></p> <p><span>Republicans serve an important role as long-term budget hawks, but in their rightward lurch they\u2019ve forgotten tried and true ways to stimulate in the short term. Cutting spending during a sluggish recovery will hurt your economy, as <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443477104577548361202287278.html\">Britain</a> can attest. Long-term debt matters, but it\u2019s okay to temporarily expand borrowing to stimulate yourself out of a recession (including with tax cuts!) when your borrowing rates are <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/07/12/the-world-desperately-wants-to-loan-us-money/\">effectively negative</a> and inflation is low.</span></p> <p><span>President Obama essentially got as much fiscal stimulus through Congress as he could. His economic team <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/100961/memo-Larry-Summers-Obama\">felt</a> the stimulus needed to be roughly twice as large to truly fill the \u201coutput gap\u201d in the economy, but the moderate Senate Democrats whose votes were needed to overcome a GOP filibuster <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-obamas-stimulus/2012/08/10/7935341e-e176-11e1-ae7f-d2a13e249eb2_story_1.html\">demanded</a> it be no larger than $800 billion.</span></p> <p><span>The bill likely should have included more aggressive action to restart the housing market, but there is no doubt that the stimulus helped the economy, Mitt Romney\u2019s claims notwithstanding. The Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/13/fact-check-did-the-stimulus-create-zero-jobs/\">estimates</a> it increased employment in the second quarter of 2010 by 1.4 to 3.3 million. Private economic forecasters and a consensus of academic studies arrive at <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-obamas-stimulus/2012/08/10/7935341e-e176-11e1-ae7f-d2a13e249eb2_story.html\">similar</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/08/the-romney-campaign-says-stimulus-doesnt-work-here-are-the-studies-they-left-out/\">conclusions</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Yet last fall, when Obama proposed the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/09/08/fact-sheet-american-jobs-act\">American Jobs Act</a>\u2014basically, a second helping of stimulus that would create 250,000 to 2 million jobs, depending on whom you ask\u2014Senate Republicans <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/11/obama-jobs-plan-senate-vote_n_1005900.html\">filibustered</a> it.</span></p> <p><span>Clearly, the two parties have very different philosophies on how to spur economic growth. Democrats favor spending while Republicans favor tax cuts and deregulation. Luckily, those two policies are not incompatible; we could pass another large stimulus package tomorrow split evenly between new spending and tax cuts. Unfortunately, polarization has reached the point where one party refuses such compromises as a rule.</span></p> <p><span>The result: Millions of Americans who could be employed search fruitlessly for work, losing skills and slipping into the ranks of the long-term unemployed. This, because politicians have lost the willingness to compromise that has kept our diverse nation together since the beginning.</span></p> <p><span>And that leaves the Fed, insulated as it is from the perverse political pressures of today\u2019s Washington, to take action. Monetary stimulus, however, is not a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/video/87394432-bernanke-says-monetary-policy-not-a-panacea.html\">panacea</a> and is <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-13/the-fed-has-done-its-part-now-it-s-congress-s-turn.html?wpisrc=nl_wonk\">reaching</a> its limits, as Ben Bernanke has warned. Congress needs to, but won\u2019t, do its part with smart fiscal policy, meaning both short-term stimulus and long-term deficit reduction.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019m as much a fan of democracy as the next American, but our political system today is of the parties, by the parties, and for the parties. Somewhere along the way, the public good got lost in the shuffle. Maybe that will change someday, but until then the Fed will remain a lonely curiosity of Washington: A proactive institution that bases its policy on sound evidence rather than partisan ideology and is beholden to no one but the American people.</span></p> <p><span><i>Wyatt N.

In fact, the structure of American foreign policy in the Middle East is so centered upon U.S.-Israeli relations that it has inevitably created tension in the Arab world. Every anti-American conflagration in the Middle East\u2014such as the recent spat of violent anti-American protests\u2014reminds us of the consequences of our special relationship with Israel. It is clear that America must do more to decentralize its focus on Israel in order to build closer ties with the broader Middle East.</span></p> <p><span>Last year, President Obama staunchly <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0911/64026.html\">sided</a> with Israel against Palestine\u2019s request for full state membership, suggesting that peace would not be achievable through any decision made at the United Nations. Since granting UN statehood would give the access to the International Criminal Court necessary to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/19/romney-campaign-%09israel-%09palestine_n_1898706.html\">allow</a> Palestine to carry out war crime prosecutions, this response appears more to be an effort to preserve the integrity of U.S.-Israeli relations than an attempt to promote peace talks. As if that isn\u2019t enough to frame the U.S. as an Israeli-centric nation, events from this month alone would erase any doubt. Namely, both Romney\u2019s recently leaked remarks about Palestine\u2019s alleged lack of interest in peace, coupled with the perceived <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/%09International/american-consulate-officer-killed-libya-attack-egyptians-flood/story?%09id=17211455%3E.\">role</a> of the American-made film \u201cInnocence of Muslims\u201d in paving the way for the attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, do little to construct a positive image for U.S. relations with the Middle East. Whether or not such claims hold even a minuscule degree of merit, one thing we can be certain of is that the attacks demonstrate a real anti-American sentiment which should be taken as a challenge for the U.S. to amend its foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span>The United States is fervent in keeping Israel on its side for a few reasons, the most important being defense. Israel is a favorable ally in part because it is a democracy that America can rely on for security cooperation. Israel is <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/%09why_we_need_israel_tza4kAkH7m7f10fCiMve4M\">lauded</a> and revered for creating some of the most advanced missiles and drones along with possessing one of the best espionage agencies in the world. Alternatively, others argue that the U.S. has a sense of moral <a href=\"http://csis.org/publication/%09israel-%09strategic-liability\">responsibility</a> to continue nourishing Israel, a mindset that was formed primarily in response to adversity Jews have faced since time imemorial. While it is only valid to agree that Israel plays an integral role in U.S. homeland security efforts, we must not be too quick to discuss moral duties when Palestinians, despite attempts at peace such as the 1993 Oslo <a href=\"http://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/oslo_eng.html\">Accords</a>, continue to have their lands settled by right-wing extremists. There is no question that military defense is a key topic in foreign relations and is crucial to the prosperity of our nation\u2014but so are human rights. If promoting human rights truly is a \u201ccentral <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/j/drl/hr/index.htm\">goal</a> of U.S. foreign policy,\u201d America must demonstrate this through encouraging peace and compromise instead of taking a passive approach in the case of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</span></p> <p><span>Israel is fated to time and again find itself at odds with the Muslim world. Naturally, America\u2019s decision to back Israel consistently has sometimes been at the root of anti-American sentiment. The U.S. does not need to completely distance itself from Israel. Rather, it must strike a balance between its support of the nation and the Middle East as a whole in order to implement fully a more holistic foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span><i>Dina M.

{"title": "All of Us Are 'Hooligans' | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When three members of the Russian punk-rock band \u201cPussy Riot\u201d were sentenced to two-year jail stints in mid-August for \u201chooliganism\u201d, human rights activists in the West jumped to their feet. Everyone from the White House and 10 Downing Street to <a href=\"http://rt.com/news/pussy-riot-appeal-hearing-354/\">Madonna and Yoko Ono</a> condemned what they deemed a disproportionate sentence for a 40-second protest against Russian President Vladimir Putin during a church service. But the attitude we take on the Pussy Riot debacle is hypocritical and is one of many examples of our condescending attitude towards countries we deem less free than our own.</span></p> <p><span>The categorical condemnation of the Pussy Riot controversy was the right course of action for individuals and governments of Western nations to take. But Western nations taking the moral high ground on this issue don\u2019t have a leg to stand on, given their own limitations on freedom of speech and instances of government abuse of legal authority. Rather than just criticizing human rights violations in other countries, we should see them as an opportunity to reflect upon and amend our own limitations on human rights. Our rightful denunciation of Putin\u2019s repression needs to be taken one step further.</span></p> <p><span>Suppose that a group similar to Pussy Riot disrupted a prayer service in London\u2019s St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral or New York\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral rather than Christ The Savior Cathedral in Moscow. All three of these churches have public spaces around them where it would be perfectly legal to protest without interrupting a service within the church, which is illegal. The police forces of all three countries would most certainly arrest protestors who interrupt a church service, regardless of how worthy their message is. If you are still convinced that our state is a more benign about cracking down on protests than Russia is, think again. On December 10, 1989, the New York Police Department <a href=\"http://articles.boston.com/2011-10-25/news/30320745_1_aids-epidemic-aids-crisis-cost-of-aids-drugs\">removed</a> several protestors from St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral for disrupting a church service. The protestors were staging a \u201cdie-in\u201d on behalf of the advocacy group ACT UP in protest of the Catholic Church\u2019s position on AIDS. The measures taken against Pussy Riot are, in some ways, reminiscent to those taken against ACT UP\u2014in both cases, activism held in an iconic location in protest of an issue already ignored by the government was crushed. Constant government repression of marginalized groups and radical ideas is clearly universal and is not limited to the developing world. Russia is not the only country that cracks down on \u201chooligans.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In all fairness, we are lucky to have many freedoms that other people around the world do not enjoy. But the West should not feel so complacent about its own stances on freedom compared to other countries. Barack Obama gave a <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/25/world/la-fg-obama-un-20120926\">speech</a> defending freedom of speech at the United Nations in light of recent protests in the Arab world against a YouTube video insulting the prophet Mohammed, while Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.latinospost.com/articles/4611/20120926/egypts-mohammed-morsi-un-general-assembly-speech-mubarak-united-nations-transcript.htm\">speech</a> defending the right to censorship in the name of religious sensitivity went largely condemned in the West. But during the 2011 riots in the United Kingdom, Parliament and the London Metropolitan Police seriously <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/dec/07/bbm-rioters-communication-method-choice\">considered</a> shutting down Twitter and BlackBerry Messenger in an attempt to prevent rioters from coordinating themselves. UK Prime Minister David Cameron <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/world/europe/12iht-social12.html\">said</a> that the \u201cfree flow of information can be used for good. But it can also be used for ill. And when people are using social media for violence we need to stop them.\u201d I see very little difference between Cameron\u2019s and Morsi\u2019s stances.</span></p> <p><span>Similarly, in 2011, the San Francisco transit authorities preemptively <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Plenty-of-losers-few-winners-in-BART-debacle-2334947.php\">shut down</a> mobile phone services in subway stations after receiving a tip that a group would be staging a protest against the shooting of an unarmed man by the police at select subway stations. What makes this any different than former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak <a href=\"http://thereboot.org/blog/2011/03/18/the-role-of-technology-in-the-egyptian-revolution/\">shutting</a> down mobile phone and internet services between January 25 and February 5, 2011, in an effort to frustrate the efforts of protestors? I do not defend the actions of dictators and those who wish to infringe upon our rights, but I refuse to defend our general naivety about our own rights violations, which allows us to have an uninformed, condescending attitude towards the rest of the world.</span></p> <p><span>This is not just another plea for the improvement of civil rights in the developed world. This is a plea for us to apply our own values of freedom to ourselves in addition to our efforts to campaign for the freedom of those who live abroad. If the rest of the world can easily identify our hypocrisies, not only is our support for human rights weakened, but the values themselves lose also their appeal.</span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span><i>Heather L.

{"title": "A Step Toward Security | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "D. SIMONE KOVACS", "body": "<p><span>Dario Guerrero-Meneses \u201915 pulled an all-nighter on August 15, filling out his application for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program the day it came out.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI stayed up and I got everything done and in the morning I got up and took it to the mail,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Guerrero-Meneses came to the United States from Mexico with his parents when he was two years old on a tourist visa meant for a wedding. They never left, and once the visa expired, they couldn\u2019t renew it. That\u2019s when they became undocumented.</span></p> <p><span>Now under DACA, a program announced June 15 by the Department of Homeland Security, Guerrero-Meneses and about a million other young people who came to the United States before their 16th birthdays are able to apply for \u201cdeferred action\u201d on their case for a period of two years.</span></p> <p><span>For many undocumented youths, including those whose nearly lifelong fears of deportation and hopes for immigration reform have followed them to Harvard, DACA represents a major step toward security in America.</span></p> <p><span>A SENSE OF SECURITY</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt means not living in fear anymore,\u201d said Mary, an undocumented junior in Quincy House who asked that her real name not be used due to her immigration status. \u201cI\u2019m just happy having deportation protection.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Under DACA, so-called \u201cchildhood arrivals\u201d who were between 15 and 30 years old on June 15, 2012, can receive temporary work authorization, a Social Security number, and a two-year reprieve from immigration proceedings. The application asks them how they came to the United States and demands information including school transcripts.</span></p> <p><span>To be eligible, applicants must also prove that they have graduated from high school, received their GED, or been honorably discharged from the Armed Forces. Criminal convictions for felonies, \u201csignificant misdemeanors,\u201d or more than three misdemeanors can disqualify applicants.</span></p> <p><span>After an applicant\u2019s materials are partially processed, he or she receives a summons to come into an Application Support Center to have biometrics\u2014fingerprints and I.D. photos\u2014taken.</span></p> <p><span>Fernando Espino \u201915, an undocumented student born in Mexico, echoed Mary\u2019s feeling of relief that the program may offer him a respite from his fear of running into legal trouble due to his immigration status.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s that nagging feeling in the back of your mind that...at any point, if it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s my parents,\u201d he said. \u201cIt provides me with a sense of calm and security, knowing that I can go about my normal life here without worrying about that.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Before DACA, undocumented persons could not get a Social Security number or the ability to work legally. As a result, even those with college degrees were often relegated to jobs that paid under the table.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn two years, I know I have two summers and advantages to take the opportunity of an internship, or a job somewhere that will hopefully lead to better things,\u201d Espino said.</span></p> <p><span>Eve, an undocumented sophomore in Winthrop House whose name was changed due to her immigration status, didn\u2019t learn she was undocumented until she started applying for jobs in high school.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI remember going to [Qdoba] and I got the application, but when I came to that last spot that asked for my Social Security number\u2026I asked my dad, \u2018Papi, what\u2019s my Social Security number,\u2019 and he didn\u2019t answer,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then, little did I know, I didn\u2019t have a Social Security number.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t understand what that meant,\u201d she added. \u201cA number\u2019s a number. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. I\u2019m still a person.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Eve, who arrived in the United States on a tourist visa when she was six, turned in the application with the Social Security number slot blank. The interview went \u201cperfectly,\u201d she said, until she explained that she couldn\u2019t provide the number.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s when it really hit me,\u201d Eve said. \u201cI remember staying calm and saying okay and exiting through that door.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But as soon as she left the fast food restaurant, Eve says she broke down.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI ran and I ran, and I cried and I asked myself, why? Like, why me? Like, what did I do?\u201d she said. \u201cLike, what the\u2014what the fuck does this number have to do with me?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE</span></p> <p><span>Like Eve, Guerrero-Meneses found out he was undocumented in high school, when he started applying to colleges.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI told my parents that I had to fill out the FAFSA, and they said, \u2018Okay, we have to have a sit-down,\u2019\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Undocumented undergraduates at Harvard\u2014students interviewed for this article said there are around 40\u2014are eligible for the same financial aid as U.S. citizens and permanent residents. But Harvard is one of only a handful of institutions able to offer the same aid packages to domestic students and those it deems \u201cinternational.\u201d In many states, undocumented students who grew up and went to high school in-state are ineligible for in-state tuition at public universities.</span></p> <p><span>While DACA grants undocumented students a postponement on consideration of their immigration case, it does not make them eligible for federal student aid and other financial support reserved for citizens and permanent residents. These financial constraints prompt some students to opt for working rather than attending college, or to shoot for private schools that could provide enough financial aid for them to attend.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard was the only one that would give me a full scholarship,\u201d Guerrero-Meneses said.</span></p> <p><span>Luis, an undergraduate who was smuggled across the Mexico-United States border with pi\u00f1atas when he was seven, said he too was unsure whether he would be able to afford college until he was accepted to Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI figured I was going to have to go to a really inexpensive school\u2014if I could go to college,\u201d said Luis, who asked that only his first name be used due to his immigration status.</span></p> <p><span>Herbert B. Castillo \u201914, the president of Fuerza Latina, said that while some undocumented students he knows feels safe from deportation at Harvard, the student organizations\u2019 members have discussed what happens once they graduate. Castillo also said there has been some worry about how the upcoming presidential election could affect the students who have applied for deferred action.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOnce you apply, you\u2019re basically giving all your information away,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people told me they weren\u2019t going to apply until after the election.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Deborah E. Anker, a clinical professor of law and the director of the Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program at the Law School, also noted that the upcoming election has created trepidation for some students thinking about applying for deferred action.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey\u2019ve surrendered to immigration service in order to get this,\u201d Anker said. \u201cIt takes a lot of courage to come forward right now at this incredible moment in history when this country could go in two such radically different directions. But these kids have demonstrated a lot of courage.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As an immigration policy change for the Department of Homeland Security that was announced by the President, DACA is not a law and can be discontinued by the next administration. But the prospect of a Mitt Romney victory in November has raised worries for those applying for relief under the policy, many of whom believe Romney\u2019s immigration track record takes a particularly harsh stance on undocumented immigrants.</span></p> <p><span>Romney announced on Tuesday, however, that he would not deport those that have been granted deferred action. Instead, he said that, if elected, he will enact immigration reform before the two-year program expires.</span></p> <p><span>Though widely viewed by immigration rights advocates as a bigger ally to undocumented students, President Barack Obama is on track to a harsher record on illegal immigration than past Republican presidents. Obama has deported around 1.5 million immigrants in just under four years in office.</span></p> <p><span>A HOPE FOR CHANGE</span></p> <p><span>Despite her experience at Qdoba, Eve did not want not to apply for deferred action at first. The program, she says, fails to address the major problems undocumented students face.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cDeferred action is a joke,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t encourage people to continue their education\u2026. If anything, it\u2019s encouraging kids to work, because it\u2019s giving you a worker\u2019s card.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But when she found out that the program might enable her to study abroad, Eve eventually decided to apply. Widespread misinformation about the program and its benefits\u2014positive and negative\u2014persists, she says, and even her lawyer was misinformed about the opportunities for travel.</span></p> <p><span>The real solution for students like Eve, most people interviewed for this article said, lies not in DACA but in the passage of the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act\u2014better known as the DREAM Act\u2014and eventually, comprehensive immigration reform.</span></p> <p><span>The DREAM Act, which was first proposed in Congress in 2001, would give conditional permanent residency to undocumented people who arrived in the United States before their 16th birthdays. As with DACA, to qualify for residency, undocumented persons would need to have obtained a GED, graduated from high school, be attending or have attended college, or have served in the military for at least two years.</span></p> <p><span>However, unlike DACA, DREAM Act beneficiaries would receive six-year temporary residency status, which would turn permanent if the person meets sufficient criteria.</span></p> <p><span>Luis said that he believes DACA was the most Obama could accomplish without approval from Congress.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m hoping that it will be replaced with something much wider, more comprehensive, that takes care of more people,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want DACA to be the end.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Anker predicted that over the next five to ten years, the changing demographics of the country will result in immigration legislation at last.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe need a legalization program. We need a program that, in my mind, brings the whole undocumented population out of the shadows and on a path\u2026to permanent status,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of opposition to that, and that opposition is rooted in a time and place of America that\u2019s over.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Other students, including Espino, said that they think the U.S. needs a better immigration process in general, not just for students. Some, who said that Mexican citizens, whose American family members can file a petition for them to receive permanent residency, expect to wait an average of 20 years for their case to be considered.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI know a lot of people would immigrate legally if the process wasn\u2019t so convoluted, so bureaucratic, so expensive,\u201d Espino said. \u201cIf there was a more successful way to immigrate legally, it would go a long way towards solving the issue.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Part of Congress\u2019 hesitancy over the DREAM Act and broader immigration reform, Anker said, stems from the fact that many Americans are not very aware of the situation that most undocumented students are in.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think they aren\u2019t aware of what a large population there is of very hardworking people who are just very much wanting to pursue the American dream, who will be incredible workers and citizens in the future,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rhetoric of the last several years has been about \u2018criminal aliens.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But some students who have long struggled against barriers for undocumented students\u2014the emotional ones and the legal ones\u2014think that DACA could be the stepping stone to a more permanent and more positive policy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cInstead of demonizing the person, look at how messed up the law is, that so many people are having to do this,\u201d Mary said. \u201cI hope that DACA will lead the way to another step up.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer D.

{"title": "In Advertisement, Retired Athletes Endorse Scott Brown | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Several retired Boston athletes became the latest group to endorse U.S. Senator Scott Brown in his reelection campaign for Massachusetts\u2019 junior Senate seat in a new television advertisement released Wednesday. Calling Brown a team player in Washington, the former Celtics and Patriots stars argued Brown deserves another term.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt seems to me, what we need are independent thinkers who will vote their consciousness, not their party,\u201d former NBA Most Valuable Player Bob Cousy said in the advertisement. \u201cThat\u2019s why on my 84th birthday, I am very pleased to endorse the return to Washington of Senator Scott Brown. He\u2019s my most valuable player.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Boston political consultants said the ad fits into a broader narrative that has emerged from Brown\u2019s campaign. Running in a state as deeply blue as Massachusetts, the Republican senator has had to fashion himself as an independent common man to woo politically independent male voters and socially conservative Democrats, consultants said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is a case where given the voter registration dominance by Democrats in Massachusetts, it\u2019s hard to run an issues-oriented or an ideological campaign, so he\u2019s trying to win with a personality campaign,\u201d said Joseph D. Malone \u201978, a Republican political strategist and former Massachusetts Congressional candidate.</span></p> <p><span>The strategy worked for Brown during the special election he won in 2010, said former Boston City Councillor Lawrence S. DiCara \u201971. During that campaign Brown caught the attention of dissatisfied Democratic voters with his easygoing persona, political independence, and pickup truck. Unlike then-opponent Mass. Attorney General Martha M. Coakley, who seemed stiff and out of touch, Brown promised likability and political independence.</span></p> <p><span>After two years in Congress in which he built up a bipartisan reputation, DiCara said Brown is putting the strategy to work again, though the circumstances are different. Presidential election years historically drive up voter turnout, which in Massachusetts means more Democratic votes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy guess is he needs those voters who have been, through the years, known as Reagan Democrats\u2014people who might vote their party in the presidential election, thus giving Obama a landslide victory in Massachusetts,\u201d Malone said. \u201cBut at the same time saying he seems like the boy next door, like the guy I could have a beer with.

Cobb, Sr. Memorial Lecture held in Sanders Theatre.</span></p> <p><span>Toobin, a staff writer for The New Yorker and the senior legal analyst for CNN, is widely regarded as one of the country\u2019s foremost Supreme Court experts.</span></p> <p><span>The Court\u2019s four liberal and five conservative Justices, he said, are key to understanding how it works.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you remember one thing from my talk, that\u2019s it. This court is driven by precisely the same party divisions that Congress is,\u201d Toobin, a former editorial chair of The Crimson, said.</span></p> <p><span>At various points in history, different ratios of liberal to conservative Justices governed the Court\u2019s rulings, he said.</span></p> <p><span>Toobin\u2019s latest book, \u201cThe Oath: The Obama White House and the Supreme Court,\u201d centers on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act case. Roberts, a conservative appointed by President George W.

Don\u2019t count on that happening very often.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Following his lecture, Toobin answered questions from the audience on topics such as the two same-sex marriage cases that could go before the Supreme Court before the end of the year, and the relationship between the President and the Court.</span></p> <p><span>Francesca Coltrera, an Arlington resident, heard about the event from a friend who works in the music department.

But Nate R. Silver, prominent statistician and political blogger for The New York Times, is an eclectic guy.</span></p> <p><span>Silver, who began blogging on politics after writing on sabermetrics in baseball, cautioned against the extant \u201cnoise\u201d in current polling information about the U.S. elections, quick volatilities that can often distract voters and media pundits, at an event co-hosted Wednesday by the Institute of Politics and Conversations with Kirkland.</span></p> <p><span>During his talk, Silver said that the current presidential election has been trickier to track than the 2008 race. \u201cIf you were a non-idiot, then you should have gotten 47 out of the 50 states right [in 2008],\u201d said Silver, who accurately predicted 49 of 50 himself. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that close of an election at the end of the day, and it turned out that most of the swing states went with Obama. And the others you could have tossed a coin, and you hoped to get lucky.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But in this year\u2019s go-round, Silver said it will be harder to predict the results. \u201cIt\u2019s both an art and a science,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>According to Silver, recent polls that have shown Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney very close behind Democratic incumbent Barack Obama are too close to make any conclusions. But when polls tilt 3 or 4 points toward one side in the race, Silver said, pundits and voters might misconstrue the shift as a signal that the candidate is pulling ahead. \u201cThe polls are often very noisy,\u201d Silver cautioned.</span></p> <p><span>Moderators Michael Shayan \u201914 and Sonal Shah, former director of the White House Office of Social Innovation, shifted the topic to baseball at the end of Silver\u2019s discussion, asking for his predictions on the Washington Nationals and Baltimore Orioles for this season.</span></p> <p><span>Silver said he was going to stick to his original pick of the Nationals winning but admitted he has not been following them too religiously. \u201cBecause of this stupid election, I haven\u2019t been able to watch much,\u201d Silver said.</span></p> <p><span>But Shayan was not disappointed. \u201cSilver is the godfather of political statistics, and we were very fortunate to bring him to speak to the Harvard community, especially considering all that\u2019s going on right now in the field,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span><i>This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:</i></span></p> <p><span><b>CORRECTION: Oct. 11</b></span></p> <p><span><span>Due to an editing error, the byline on an earlier version of this article was incorrect.

{"title": "Debased Debate | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>A\u00a0presidential debate has the potential to bring more clarity to voters about the candidates' stances, but last week\u2019s content was far from achieving that ideal. While it is true that a cumbersome format and problematic moderation contributed to the substandard quality of the debate, the most unproductive aspect, it seems, was Mitt Romney\u2019s choice to forego his own policy plan in front of a a national audience, and to fabricate what amounts to an alternative reality of policy plans, rather than engage in a direct dialogue with President Obama.</span></p> <p><span>While it is true that Obama\u2019s came across as somewhat listless and off-kilter last Wednesday, he at least attempted to engage Romney in a substantive discussion of their major differences in economic policy. Early on in the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/2012-presidential-debate-president-obama-and-mitt-romneys-remarks-in-denver-on-oct-3-running-transcript/2012/10/03/24d6eb6e-0d91-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_story.html\">debate</a>, Obama directly challenged Romney regarding his plans to cut taxes for the wealthy, to which Romney responded by saying that he is \u201cnot going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people.\u201d This is, at the very least, an <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Economist-Mom/2012/1005/Presidential-debate-The-details-or-lack-thereof-of-Romney-s-tax-plan\">obfuscation</a> of the facts, as <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-10-03/romney-looking-at-different-caps-on-tax-breaks\">a quick look at Romney\u2019s policy plans reveals</a>. In addition to ending the estate tax and the gift tax, Romney plans to drop the top tax rate for those with the highest incomes from 35 percent to 28 percent.</span></p> <p><span>While discussing healthcare policy, Romney responded to Obama\u2019s allegations about his plan not covering pre-existing conditions with another false claim. He said, \u201cAnd with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on\u2014on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That\u2019s part of my health care plan.\u201d That is <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-his-health-care-plan-covers-pre-e/\">not</a> part of Romney\u2019s health care plan.</span></p> <p><span>The very medium of debate is debased when one candidate chooses to make up policy on the spot. If citizens walk away with anything useful from last week\u2019s debate, it should be a reinforced skepticism of Mitt Romney\u2019s suitability for the job of being President. As President Obama pointed out, \u201cAt some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they\u2019re too good?\u201d The American people have an answer to this question. Last week\u2019s debate demonstrated to us all that Mitt Romney\u2019s plans are weak, insubstantial, and prone to constant transformation, just like the candidate who has proposed them.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Setting the Record Straight | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>During shopping week, I was quickly introduced to the typical gripes about freshman classes at Harvard: \u201cthere\u2019s too much reading,\u201d \u201cthe exams are brutal,\u201d and of course, \u201cthe TFs are terrible.\u201d\u00a0 But there was one particular complaint reserved for Economics 10: \u201cIt has a conservative bias.\u201d\u00a0 A misunderstanding about the study of economics drives this common misconception.</span></p> <p><span>To liberal students like myself and most other Harvard undergrads, economics can seem like an inherently conservative field.\u00a0 Traditionally liberal policies, such as a highly progressive income tax, are often grounded in arguments about social equality and fairness.\u00a0 Conservative policies tend to be rooted in arguments about the efficiency of free markets.\u00a0 Thus, in a class that focuses on explaining how markets work, students will inevitably be exposed to more arguments used in favor of conservative policy than liberal policy.\u00a0 This apparent bias is not due to Professor Mankiw\u2019s political leanings, but to the nature of the subject.</span></p> <p><span>Another major reason for the misconceptions about Ec 10 is the confusion between academic economics and policy economics.\u00a0 Economic policymakers engage in debate about what policies governments \u201cshould\u201d employ, including welfare systems and redistributive tax programs.\u00a0 Ec 10 deals with the fundamentals of academic economics, a field that explicitly avoids making statements about what \u201cought\u201d to happen, and concentrates on explaining economic data in dispassionate terms.\u00a0 This means that although it is true that liberal economic policies are not heavily covered in the class, students should recognize that conservative policies are not given any more weight.</span></p> <p><span>The fact that Professor Mankiw uses his own textbook is often used to fuel the argument against Ec 10\u2014students complain that his personal, conservative opinions are given too much weight in the course\u2014but it gives us an easy way to test those allegations.\u00a0 If Mankiw\u2019s \u201cPrinciples<i> </i>of<i> </i>Economics\u201d<i> </i>were really a conservative-leaning textbook, then surely it would contrast with that published by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman.\u00a0 Although Mankiw can reasonably be labeled a moderate, Krugman is a veritable liberal firebrand.\u00a0 But the fundamentals of the two books are the same.</span></p> <p><span>The reason for the textbooks\u2019 similarities is simple\u2014the basic methods of economics taught in Ec 10 are not politically controversial.\u00a0 There are not competing schools of thought when it comes to the supply and demand curves.\u00a0 Both books show that taxes generally result in outcomes that create less total surplus than if the market was left to its own devices.\u00a0 They both also note that government intervention can help avoid market failure and provide some amount of equality that the invisible hand does not.\u00a0 Critically, neither of these points is itself an argument for government policy; they are non-partisan statements about observable economic outcomes.</span></p> <p><span>Liberal complaints about Ec 10 are nothing new.\u00a0 In 1997, when Martin Feldstein taught the course, students distributed <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1997/5/5/students-protest-ec-10-bias-pbaker/\">pamphlets protesting a \u201cconservative bias.\u201d</a> Students aligned with the Occupy movement made headlines last November when they staged a walkout to draw attention to their criticisms of the course.\u00a0 In an <a href=\"http://hpronline.org/harvard/an-open-letter-to-greg-mankiw/\">open letter to Professor Greg Mankiw</a>, the students wrote that, \u201cA legitimate academic study of economics must include a critical discussion of both the benefits and flaws of different economic simplifying models.\u201d\u00a0 It is certainly reasonable to ask that professors consider different interpretations and challenges to controversial theories, but no one would insist that an introductory language course present alternative interpretations of verb conjugations. \u00a0Ec 10 deals with the basic language of economics, and there is not much controversy about it.</span></p> <p><span>The open letter written last November said, \u201cwe enrolled in Economics 10 hoping to gain a broad and introductory foundation of economic theory that would assist us in our various intellectual pursuits and diverse disciplines.\u201d\u00a0 That is why I am taking Ec 10, and I believe many of my classmates made the same choice.\u00a0 The analytical methods and theories presented in Ec 10 are absolutely applicable to a wide range of fields, and it is a shame if students are discouraged from taking the course because of the unwarranted complaints it receives.</span></p> <p><span>Criticizing Ec 10 also does an injustice to Professor Mankiw, whose opinions were made clear in the first lecture when he took a jab at a classic liberal punching bag: George W. Bush.\u00a0 He projected a picture of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke giving a speech with W standing on his left; above Bush\u2019s head, Mankiw put a speech bubble that read, \u201cWhat the heck is he talking about?\u201d\u00a0 Would he make the same joke about Romney?\u00a0 I think not, but I am equally convinced that Mankiw\u2019s Ec 10 is fair and balanced, and that anyone who does not take the course out of fear of being brainwashed by right-wing economic theory is only doing detriment to him or herself.</span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span><i>Nick M.

Born in Mumbai, India and raised in Houston, Texas, Shah received her  masters in Economics from Duke University and then headed to Washington  D.C. where she worked for the Treasury Department under the Clinton  administration, doing work that took her all over the world.</span></span></p> <p><span><span> </span></span></p> <p><span><span>In  1995, after bombing had devastated Sarajevo, Shah worked with the  treasury there to create a central banking system for the region.  Through working in Sarajevo and dealing with conflict, Shah learned the  importance of compromise and bringing together a group to solve  problems. \"You couldn't go into a post-conflict situation and pick  winners. You had to bring everyone to the table to figure out  solutions,\" she said.</span></span></p> <p><span><span> </span></span></p> <p><span><span>In 2002, after working in government for seven years, Shah decided to pursue a different path.

Her eloquent prose and compelling scientific studies convinced the public to forge a path to sustainability, albeit a winding one filled with potholes and roadblocks. By the end of her life Carson had contracted cancer, yet she bravely testified before President Kennedy\u2019s Science Advisory Committee, defending the wildlife that couldn\u2019t defend itself.</span></p> <p><span>On Sept. 27, \u00a0a panel of individuals at the forefront of the environmental movement gathered in Sanders Theater for \u201cScience and Advocacy: The Legacy of Silent Spring,\u201d commemorating the 50-year anniversary of the book\u2019s release.</span></p> <p><span>When I first saw the line-up, learning that the discussion would involve everyone from Bill E. McKibben \u201982, environmental activist and author of \u201cThe End of Nature,\u201d to James McCarthy, former co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, I knew I had to attend.</span></p> <p><span>The moderator was Daniel P. Schrag, Director of the Harvard University Center for the Environment, who studies climate change and currently serves on President Obama\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Under his guidance, the panelists discussed questions that echoed Carson herself, resonating with a need for change. I couldn\u2019t have agreed more.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019d been feeling a little angsty lately, slightly unfulfilled by being back on campus this fall. It\u2019s not as if I found direct fault with the University, but I couldn\u2019t help wondering if my time here was better spent doing something more concrete, something in \u201cthe real world\u201d as opposed to academia. Sure, I was learning a lot from lecture, yet I still felt like a cog in a wheel rather than a student with a vision. There was clearly something amiss. The answer came to me at the end of the discussion.</span></p> <p><span>The panel took the audience\u2019s questions, written down on index cards and passed to ushers standing in the aisles. I saw one of them shuffling through the thick stack of cards and wondered, doubtfully, if my question would be selected. After Schrag asked the panelists to comment on a few general questions, he paused for a moment and his tone became more serious. For this final question, he didn\u2019t paraphrase or extrapolate on the audience member\u2019s wording\u2014he read, straight from the index card, my simple question in earnest scrawl:</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHow do you suggest that we\u2014as college students\u2014avoid the moral decisions made by previous generations\u2014how do we alter the path we\u2019re on?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A silence followed, after which the first panelist\u2014William C. Clark, ecologist, author, and Kennedy School professor\u2014cleared his throat and said, \u201cI think I just teared up.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He continued, saying, \u201cBe outraged. A lot more than you are. And master something that will let you turn that outrage into effective action.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>One by one, each panelist took a turn answering my almost child-like question that, although a natural one for me, obviously struck a chord with these experts so used to the highbrow speech of the professional world.</span></p> <p><span>The panel ended with McKibben saying, although he wished he could tell me to have a good time and enjoy the next four years, that the ice shelf is already broken and that college campuses will be a central place for this fight to take place.</span></p> <p><span>I wish that more students had gone to the discussion. Vain as it may sound and self-evident as it was, I wish more of my peers could have heard my question and asked themselves the same. So much of college is figuring out what we want to do with our lives. So much of the learning we do here is learning about ourselves. Yet how much of that is centered around what we should be doing, not just as citizens, but as students\u2014students at arguably the most prestigious and powerful university in the world?</span></p> <p><span>Many of us will graduate with very little clue of what we want to do long-term, and that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not suggesting that we become household names by the time we receive our diplomas (although this will inevitably be the case for some of our peers).

{"title": "HSPH Study Suggests Health Care is a Deciding Factor for Voters | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Barack Obama wins three to one against Mitt Romney among those voters who say that health care is their primary concern, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health learned. Overall, with voters ranking health care as the second most important factor in determining their presidential choice for the first time since 1992, Obama\u2019s lead among that category of voters may prove significant.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWith the passage of the Affordable Care Act, we\u2019ve started a debate about one of the biggest pieces of health care legislation in U.S. history,\u201d said Robert J. Blendon, a School of Public Health professor who authored the study. \u201cBecause it\u2019s so large and so controversial, it really has become a voting issue.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Controversy over Obama\u2019s 2010 health care legislation, combined with campaign trail talk about Medicare policy, shifted voters\u2019 attention to the issue of health care, Blendon said.</span></p> <p><span>With Romney pledging to repeal Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and to follow his vice presidential candidate Paul D. Ryan\u2019s plan to offer seniors a fixed voucher for either private insurance or Medicare, the divide between the candidates\u2019 positions on health care seems stark.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSuddenly, you have two candidates representing vastly different policies on different elements of health care, and voters are taking notice and beginning to choose sides. Three times to one, that side was with Obama,\u201d Blendon said.</span></p> <p><span>John M. Benson, a research scientist at the School of Public Health, said, \u201cWe are always interested in what role health care has in the election. We wanted to, in this case, look at the issues that have been in the campaign, which would be the ACA, Ryan\u2019s Medicare proposal, block grants for Medicaid, and more restrictions on abortion\u2014the big four health care issues...and to look at the people who said health care and Medicare specifically was going to alter their vote.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>To measure the significance of issues to the voters, Benson, Blendon, and their colleagues gathered polling data from citizens nationwide. After determining that a subject was registered and planning to vote in the 2012 election, poll administrators presented subjects with a list of issues: the economy and jobs, health care and Medicare, federal budget deficit and taxes, abortion, the war in Afghanistan, and immigration. They asked, \u201cWhat is your single top issue when it comes to your choice of a presidential candidate?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>For 51 percent of the respondents, the economy and jobs was the most important issue. Health care and Medicare beat out the other options with 20 percent of votes.</span></p> <p><span>Those who selected health care as their top issue were then presented with sets of issues that presidential candidates are talking about regarding nationwide health care and the candidates\u2019 respective stances. Participants chose the specific decisions important to them.</span></p> <p><span>The last time health care ranked as so many voters\u2019 main concern was 20 years ago, when former President Bill Clinton ran in 1992 on implementing nationwide health insurance.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cGenerally, the big issues in any election tend to be the economy in one form or another and if there\u2019s any kind of foreign conflict, that\u2019s the other issue,\u201d Benson said. \u201cOther domestic issues fit in when there aren\u2019t wars or recessions, and this is why we see health care making a rise in prominence.\u201d</span></p>"}

Meanwhile, dozens of Western peace activists traveled to Islamabad to protest Pakistan\u2019s atrocious <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/human-rights-spotlight-pakistan/2011/03/29/gIQAh8mGSI_blog.html\">human rights</a> record. Just kidding. They were there to participate in a <a href=\"http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/u-s-peace-activists-in-pakistan-decry-drone-strikes/\">convoy</a> bound for South Waziristan to protest American drone strikes, a lynchpin of American strategy for securing Afghanistan\u2019s borders with Pakistan. Because of these recent developments, now seems like an appropriate time for a reminder of why drones are a boon for both the United States and human rights.</span></p> <p><span>The statistics, from both governmental and independent sources, are quite conclusive on the effectiveness of drone strikes both as a military tactic and as a tactic for avoiding damage to civilians. According to the Long War Journal, between 2006 and October 1, 2012, drone strikes in northwestern Pakistan killed approximately <a href=\"http://www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.php\">2,400</a> Taliban, al Qaeda, and other insurgent operatives versus only about <a href=\"http://www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.php\">140</a> civilians.</span></p> <p><span>Some<a href=\"file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/business.THECRIMSON/My%20Documents/Downloads/counterterrorism.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/bergentiedemann2.pdf\"> institutes</a> point out the unavoidable challenges in confirming deaths and therefore estimate the number of killed civilians to be slightly higher and the number of killed insurgents to be slightly lower. What no one can dispute, however, is the remarkable strike rate, particularly when compared to the casualty rates of conventional war.</span></p> <p><span>These strikes are not only wiping out threats, but they are also preventing present insurgent forces from organizing themselves effectively. Pir Zubair Shah\u2019s excellent <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/02/27/my_drone_war\">article</a> in Foreign Policy exposed the blistering effect of American drone strikes on the Taliban and insurgent groups. He writes, \u201cThe Taliban and al Qaeda had stopped using electronic devices\u2026They would no longer gather in huge numbers, even in mosques to pray, and spent their nights outside for safety, a life that was wearing thin.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Of course, numbers and anecdotes cannot tell the whole story. A more challenging issue to resolve is whether this strategy trades short-term benefits for long-term regional instability, not to mention long-term distrust of American foreign policy. Although such analyses, like that offered in <a href=\"http://livingunderdrones.org/\">last month\u2019s</a> report from Stanford Law School, offer accurate critiques of America\u2019s reliance on drone strikes, they cannot really offer any strategic alternatives besides either ignoring North Waziristan with crossed fingers or invading the region. Neither of those options is consistent with our goal of securing Afghanistan.</span></p> <p><span>Critics, besides those who instinctively lambast any display of American power, tend to focus on two problems of moral hazard.</span></p> <p><span>The first moral hazard relates to the creation of a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/five-things/drones/12659/\">videogame effect</a>.\u201d The theory is that as the military\u2019s reliance on drones rises, so too does the risk that drone operators will forget that those shapes on a screen are actually human beings. The problem with this theory is that it is, as our vice president might say, malarkey. Although the number of militants killed <a href=\"http://counterterrorism.newamerica.net/drones\">per strike</a> stayed at approximately six from 2004 to 2012, the number of civilians or unknowns killed per strike has actually declined from a 10.7 in the period from 2004 to 2007 to 0.7 in 2011 and a stunning 0.1 thus far in 2012.</span></p> <p><span>The other <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\">moral hazard</a> point, raised by the New York Times, is the precedent set by being the first country to use unmanned drones to kill enemies across borders. As American Civil Liberties Union National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi eloquently <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/us-targeted-killings-program-dangerous-precedent\">stated</a>, drone strikes set a precedent that \u201ccould be used tomorrow by nations with less respect for the right to life in particular, and human rights in general.\u201d This hazard is real, but it is not actually a convincing argument against developing drones. Nations with less respect for human rights will not care whether a precedent has been set by the United States before developing unmanned aerial vehicles.</span></p> <p><span>Which brings us back to Hezbollah\u2019s drone. Michael B. Oren, besides being Israel\u2019s Ambassador to America, is also an accomplished historian. In his book Six Days of War on Israel\u2019s overwhelming victory in 1967, he points out that fear of an attack on Israel\u2019s Dimona nuclear reactor in the Negev Desert was a decisive factor in Israel\u2019s decision to preemptively strike Egypt\u2019s military during the Six-Day War. Last week\u2019s drone, flying over Gaza and bound for the Negev, may appear to Israel\u2019s military as a case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Regardless of whether or not Hezbollah\u2019s drones could truly provide any tactical advantage, they heighten Israel\u2019s sense of insecurity at a particularly fragile time.</span></p> <p><span>I would be remiss not to incorporate the impending election into this column somehow. As Obama and Romney likely will discuss in their upcoming debates, they both intend to extend the use of drone strikes into the near future. Unless Gary Johnson or Jill Stein pulls off a miracle, they will remain an important component of American military strategy. And that\u2019s a good thing.</span></p> <p><span><i>Eric T.

{"title": "Depressed Yuan, Equivocal Yawn | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Recently, a few friends asked me about my next op-ed\u2019s topic, and my accurate reply\u2014\u201cthe U.S.-Chinese exchange rate\u201d\u2014struck with a deafening blandness. I tacked on with a mumble, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll come up with something more interesting.\u201d Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t.</span></p> <p><span>I stuck with it in part because I had this reassuring (and at least somewhat true) <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/1627/china.aspx\">statistic</a> to bolster me: 86 percent of Americans are concerned about the yuan-dollar exchange rate. They are worried about China. Per a recent Gallup poll, a majority of respondents, 51 percent, called themselves \u201cvery concerned\u2026 about trade relations with China.\u201d Another 35 percent expressed some concern. (Notably, only one percent professed absolutely \u201cno opinion\u201d\u2014among them, apparently, the people I call friends.) Ultimately, to be concerned about \u201ctrade relations with China\u201d almost necessarily entails concern about the yuan-dollar exchange rate. Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/10/13/romney-ryan-call-china-cheaters-in-global-economy-obama-soft-on-issue/\">has vowed</a> to brand China as a currency manipulator on day one of his presidency; meanwhile, Barack Obama <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/10/06/obama-says-china-manipulates-its-currency/\">has verbally</a> (sans the legal ramifications Mr. Romney supports) labeled China as a manipulator and, although not tied to currency manipulation, also levied tariffs on Chinese tire imports.</span></p> <p><span>Here is the manipulation tale, in short. The Chinese government accumulates large quantities of foreign, especially U.S., assets. The outflow of Chinese capital to achieve this tends to depress the world price of the renminbi, or \u201cpeople\u2019s currency,\u201d better known as the yuan. In the face of cheaper Chinese imports, U.S. competitors suffer and employ fewer Americans. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/magazine/come-on-china-buy-our-stuff.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;\">Studies have placed</a> job losses anywhere from 200,000 to 3 million. A giant, veritable \u201c<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkgx1C_S6ls\">sucking sound</a>,\u201d as Ross Perot put it.</span></p> <p><span>There are, however, a few less visible (or, in the case of Perot\u2019s sucking sound, less audible) mitigating factors. For one, goods made in China aren\u2019t exactly Chinese goods. <a href=\"http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2011/el2011-25.pdf\">A study by the San Francisco Fed</a> determined that, \u201con average, of every dollar spent on an item labeled \u201cMade in China,\u201d 55 cents go for services produced in the United States.\u201d That\u2019s in contrast to 36 cents repatriated on imports from countries other than China. That 19-point spread matters\u2014especially because a higher exchange rate will likely shift, not eliminate, imports. Moreover, Baizhu Chen, professor at USC\u2019s Marshall School of Business, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesleadershipforum/2011/12/22/buying-from-china-is-in-fact-buying-american/\">points out</a> that the San Francisco Fed\u2019s value-added numbers reveal a $70 billion surplus for the U.S. in its trade with China, not the official, towering deficit.</span></p> <p><span>For mitigating factor number two: Whatever the trade imbalance, currency manipulation doesn\u2019t drive it. <a href=\"http://chinaperspectives.revues.org/3063\">Research</a> by Peter Navarro of UC Irvine attributes a mere 11-12 percent of the \u201cChina price\u201d (the price advantage of Chinese goods in the U.S. market) to currency manipulation. Among other factors, government subsidies and low domestic wages hold more weight, especially the latter.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, another mitigating factor is important to consider. The yuan is rising. Since a strict dollar peg was removed seven years ago, the yuan <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/currency/yuan/index.html\">has risen</a> 40 percent against the dollar, adjusting for inflation. And The Economist\u2019s appealingly named Big Mac Index, which measures purchasing-power parity through McDonalds\u2019 iconic sandwich, tells more. The raw index shows the yuan as undervalued. But that doesn\u2019t account for an additional variable, unrelated to currency manipulation: lower GDP-per-capita countries like China tend to have cheaper currencies (through lower productivity and lower wages). Factoring in this exogenous trait, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21524811\">The Economist finds</a> near-parity between the yuan and the dollar.</span></p> <p><span>Probably less trustworthy, the Chinese government has echoed this claim. But perhaps it\u2019s begun to realize its nation doesn\u2019t even benefit from its own manipulation. China buys U.S. assets, and then sends the U.S. more and more manufactured products\u2014all in exchange for the precious opportunity to spend long hours making those products, dump the revenue back into U.S. assets to depress the exchange rate, rinse, and repeat.</span></p> <p><span>All of these words above, of course, merely amount to mitigating circumstances. But they are appended to the fact that cheap Chinese goods have greatly benefited U.S. consumers, especially the poor, who dedicate a disproportionate amount of their income to consumer goods. That\u2019s worth preserving, and there\u2019s a dangerous alternative scenario that threatens: a war of trade sanctions. To those relying on mutually assured destruction as a deterrent, imports aren\u2019t warheads. Even two longtime partners, the U.S. and E.U., waged the long and bizarre \u201cbanana wars\u201d <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/1999/mar/05/eu.wto3\">trade battle</a>, which germinated with E.U. banana sanctions and spilled over into luxury goods. If oblong, yellow fruit can ignite a trade war, anything can.</span></p> <p><span>In the end, the core issue isn\u2019t currency manipulation, especially as steeply rising Chinese wages obsolete any true ill effects (China <a href=\"http://www.alixpartners.com/en/WhatWeThink/Manufacturing/2011USManufacturingOutsourcingIndex.aspx\">has already risen</a> above India and Mexico in manufacturing outsource costs). Intellectual property violations remain endemic, dampening innovation in both America and China. And that accompanies a broader Chinese atmosphere arrayed against foreign business, including domestic favoritism through subsidies, certification rules to block foreign products, and <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ae64093e-b677-11df-86ca-00144feabdc0.html#axzz299ZJfwjY\">other regulations</a>. In that light, we should be \u201cconcerned about trade relations with China.\u201d But the ballyhooed exchange rate is merely a distraction. Abroad and at home, the United States finds itself confronted with real, critical problems. Both candidates realize that. But they refuse to realize: Chinese currency manipulation isn\u2019t one of them.</span></p> <p><span><i>Brian L. Cronin \u201915, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Mather House</i>.</span></p>"}

Following his (first) historic win, Obama called the victory \"a significant change from the Harvard Law School of the past,\" adding that \"for every one of me, there are a whole bunch of young Black people who, because of drugs, poverty, or whatever, aren't getting the opportunities I have.\" Even then, Obama hinted at his later ambitions, saying his future plans could range from running for political office to running public service programs. So modest.</span></p> <p><span>As he prepared for post-graduate life in 1991, Obama tried his hand in another election\u2014this time for <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1991/1/31/haa-and-hraaa-name-candidates-pin/\">a seat on Harvard's Board of Overseers</a>, the University's second-highest governing body.

Alter \u201979, a columnist for Bloomberg View, argued that \u201cthe super PAC money is no good on the ground,\u201d where Obama has developed a strong base of supporters willing to take to the phones and persuade others to support their cause.</span></p> <p><span>Looking more broadly at the election, Alter also likened the current race to that of Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. Although the president was unable to defeat Carter in the general election, \u201cFord began to close the gap\u201d in September, he said. \u201cRomney has some momentum now and it is a question of whether president Obama can break that momentum,\u201d Alter said.</span></p> <p><span>The members of the panel were also asked for their predictions on who would be the victor in November.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think both candidates will be in the 200 plus electoral votes,\u201d sad Carlos E.

What about Elmo, Ernie, and the Cookie Monster?</b></span></p> <p><span>Although Mitt Romney admitted his admiration for Big Bird in Denver, it remains to be seen how much he cares about the other characters. We're a bit partial to Elmo ourselves, and we felt neglected on his behalf. Hopefully he'll get a little bit of love tonight.</span></p> <p><span><b>2. Can Romney top Denver?</b></span></p> <p><span>With a commanding performance last time around, Romney comes into tonight as the favorite to win the debate. Can Mitt pull off another win?</span></p> <p><span><b>3. Who will the topics favor?</b></span></p> <p><span>The topics in the first debate, such as the economy and health care, lent themselves to an attack on Obama's record that Romney successfully deployed. Tonight's discussion will feature questions from the audience that could veer toward foreign policy topics Obama is more comfortable discussing.</span></p> <p><span><b>4. Numbers, Numbers, Numbers</b></span></p> <p><span>Cable station pundits quickly pointed out that Obama referenced neither the \"one percent\" nor Romney's \"47 percent\" during the first debate. But what about the eight percent (our nation's unemployment rate), the 1.3 percent (the inflation rate), the 49 percent (Obama's approval rating), or the 68 percent (percentage of American women who <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/28/ufo-poll-obama-romney-repel-space-aliens_n_1635772.html\">think</a> Obama is more equipped to handle an alien invasion)?</span></p> <p><span><b>5. Mittens</b></span></p> <p><span>Mitt Romney has accumulated a lot of nicknames over the course of this campaign, including \"The Mittster\" and our personal favorite, \"Mittens.\" With tonight's projected low of 45 degrees at Hofstra University, will the Mittster be debuting a new pair of mittens?</span></p>"}
{"title": "Brown, Warren Announce Mounting Fundraising Figures | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The most expensive U.S. Senate race in the country appeared even more costly Monday when U.S. Senator Scott Brown and Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren announced that they had raised $7.45 million and $12.1 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2012.</span></p> <p><span>The totals from July, August, and September bring the candidates\u2019 combined total for the race to more than $60 million. Warren, who has been the best-financed Congressional candidate in the country this year, has now raised a total of more than $36 million. Brown has raised a more modest $27.4 million, but he started the race with $7 million left over from his 2010 special election run for the Senate. Both campaigns have received millions of dollars from out-of-state donors.</span></p> <p><span>The high fundraising totals and out of state donors point to the race\u2019s national prominence this election year. The Bay State seat is seen as a crucial battleground in the fight for control of the U.S. Senate.</span></p> <p><span>But with Election Day only three weeks away, political strategists say the campaigns\u2019 fundraising success in the past has lessened the potency of money as the race winds down.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe amount of money [Warren] raised in the last quarter is astounding, but what is also amazing is how little the money can buy these candidates in the last three weeks,\u201d said Republican political consultant Todd Domke. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much TV or radio time they can buy.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As cash declines in significance, the presidential race has unexpectedly risen in importance, Domke said. Though Obama is still expected to win Massachusetts in a landslide, former Mass. Governor Mitt Romney\u2019s strengthening poll numbers have raised new questions about Obama\u2019s prospective margin of victory in the Commonwealth. If that margin narrows, Brown will likely pick up the former Obama supporters and may have enough to support to upset the Democratic Warren, Domke said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt comes down to this external factor. And partly that\u2019s because Warren\u2019s [campaign] is much more invested in riding Obama\u2019s coattails than winning on her own,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Democratic political strategist Mary Anne Marsh said that the breakdown of donation numbers\u2014which have only been released in summarized form\u2014provides important insight into the campaigns\u2019 respective supporters.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFundraising is the truest measure of support before the votes are cast,\u201d she said. \u201cIt tells you who really supports a candidate...especially in a close race in the home stretch,\u201d Marsh wrote in an email to The Crimson. She could not be reached by phone.</span></p> <p><span>Brown\u2019s campaign said 60 percent of his donations came from within Massachusetts.

Scadden wrote in an email.</span></p> <p><span>A reduction in federal funding would have implications for universities across the nation and could even \u201cthreaten the preeminence of the US in biomedical research and innovation as it depends on a pipeline of talented people with bold ideas,\u201d Scadden wrote.</span></p> <p><span><b>RESEARCHING THE PLATFORMS</b></span></p> <p><span>While both candidates have repeatedly emphasized their support for scientific research, their platforms reveal differences in their plans for providing that aid.</span></p> <p><span>In previous statements, Obama has said that he wants to double scientific research funding. In his 2012 budget proposal, he increased funds for the National Institutes of Health by three percent, to $32 billion for basic and applied biomedical research.</span></p> <p><span>Romney\u2019s platform calls for budget cuts to research funding and to agencies such as the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities, stating that research should be privatized instead.</span></p> <p><span>Scientific American asked the two candidates a series of questions regarding their positions on research and innovation in America. In the interview, Obama reaffirmed his promise to increase government spending on research: \u201cI strongly support investments in research and development that help spur America innovation and proposed a goal that, as a country, we invest more than 3 percent of our GDP in public and private research and development.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Romney repeated his pro-private industry stance: \u201cGood public policy must also ensure that federal research is being amplified in the private sector, and that major breakthroughs are able to make the leap from the laboratory to the marketplace.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>CUTS ON THE HORIZON</b></span></p> <p><span>Before the next presidential inauguration, a series of automatic, across-the-board spending cuts\u2014known as sequestration\u2014are set to slash research funding by 8.2 percent beginning on Jan. 2, 2013.</span></p> <p><span>The choice of a president, as well as the outcome of the Congressional elections, could set the tone for how Congress addresses the looming sequestration during the waning days of its session, said Suzanne Day, Harvard\u2019s director of federal relations.</span></p> <p><span>The next commander-in-chief could ask Congress to balance its budget by means other than sequestration, avoiding the automatic cuts. The Obama White House has said that it does not support sequestration, and Romney has spoken out against it as well.</span></p> <p><span>But if Congress cannot avoid the sequester, Harvard will face an immediate reduction in research funding for the current fiscal year, according to Kevin Casey, Harvard\u2019s chief lobbyist and vice president for public affairs and communications.</span></p> <p><span>This summer, University President Drew G. Faust co-signed a letter along with more than 100 fellow university presidents addressed to President Obama and Congress. Their missive urged the legislators to overcome partisan differences so that they could prevent the cuts that sequestration would bring.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSequestration is an undiscerning and blunt budget tool that would substantially harm our nation\u2019s future by blindly slashing valuable investments in education and scientific research,\u201d the letter read, ending by stating, \u201cAs national leaders in higher education, we urge you to show America and the world that our country\u2019s political system is capable of solving serious problems.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Harvard is now working with other leading research universities, including Stanford, Michigan, and the University of Texas, as well as industries that benefit from academic research, to make a collective argument on behalf of the university-government research partnership</span></p> <p><span>The University has not shied away from urging political action to preserve science funding before\u2014notably, then-University President Neil L. Rudenstine said in his 1995 Commencement address that Harvard\u2019s research was \u201cseriously at risk\u201d and urged those assembled to vote against candidates who would propose cuts to research.</span></p> <p><span><b>THE CASE FOR FUNDS</b></span></p> <p><span>Harvard academics have utilized federal money since the early years of the Cold War, when the American government, eager to remain competitive with other nations,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/10/21/fabric-nation-375/\">began distributing funding to research universities</a>.</span></p> <p><span>During those years, Harvard attributed much of its own growth to funding from the federal government. Today, a significant portion of Harvard\u2019s federal funding flows through the National Institutes of Health, a government-funded entity that doles out cash for science research.</span></p> <p><span><span>If Congress does not act, sequestration will require an immediate 8.2 percent reduction in the agency's budget, and Casey said \"that becomes almost impossible to manage for the National Institutes of Health.\"</span></span></p> <p><span>Scadden believes that government agencies should support university research because scholars\u2019 vital studies may not be attractive to private companies.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBasic research is critically dependent on the federal government as it is too far from  a product that can be sold to be of interest to companies,\u201d he said. Yet such experiments, he said, can form \u201cthe basis for innovations that have had enormous impact on the well-being of society.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Casey agreed that academic research can lead to significant contributions to society, even monetary ones, in the long run.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere are so many competing, well-deserving programs in the federal budget, but not all of them are ones that pay back in the way that we believe research and education do over time,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThe longer view would say that the young men and women who are getting educated are going to be paying more in taxes over time.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Nicholas P.

Barrett", "body": "<p><span>In a panel convened to discuss the parallels between Evangelical Christians and Latter Day Saints, Mark R. Silk \u201972, a professor of religion at Trinity College, aimed to tell the \u201chidden story of religion in the election and in the Republican Party.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Voter demographics from the past twenty years have shown that voters who strongly claim a religious identity usually align themselves with the Republican Party. This trend, known as the \u201cgod gap,\u201d is most obvious among Evangelicals and Mormons, Silk said. In fact, over 75% of Mormons voted for the Republican nominee for the past 12 elections.</span></p> <p><span>Both the Mormons and Evangelicals focus their rhetoric around a return to past ideals, according to Silk. \u201cThe idea of going back to the golden days is as old as civilization,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>After a period of conservatism in the early twentieth century, these communities became less vocal in their cultural criticisms and moved towards an acceptance of mainstream society, according to Silk. However, as they watched the progressive movements of the 1960s, many began to believe that a return to conservatism with a focus on family values would better suit the country.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat activated the religious gene was to recover what was lost in the 1960s,\u201d Silk said.</span></p> <p><span>As the two religions began to ignite social change through politics, an idea of American exceptionalism emerged in an attempt to restore a country that served as an example to other nations. This theory was reinforced by Ronald Reagan who adopted the biblical phrase \u201ca city on a hill.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Presidential candidate Mitt Romney reinforces the idea of exceptionalism today, as well as the idea of restoration, Silk said. Romney\u2019s Super PAC is named \u201cRestore our Future.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMormons are not going back to Brigham Young\u2019s Zionism, but there is a pull in that direction,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Despite similarities between these two groups, Silk said that each is generally not cognizant of the actions of the other group. \u201cIt is clear that they are unaware of each other\u2019s thoughts. They are both in the conservative \ufb01ght, but they don\u2019t work together,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWithout the publicity of Mitt Romney, Mormons, who are only two percent of the US population, would not even be featured in this discussion,\u201d said history professor Laurel Thatcher Ulrich in a critical examination following the lecture.</span></p> <p><span>She also pointed out that Romney\u2019s campaign has been much more focused on economics than religion. \u201cMany Mormons are not happy that this is the world\u2019s most famous Mormon,\u201d Ulrich said.</span></p> <p><span>Overall, the crowd engaged with the panel, asking questions and participating in the discussion.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is de\ufb01nitely a pertinent issue in the midst of the upcoming election, one that deserves this kind of intense discussion,\u201d Emma R.

{"title": "Binders Full of Women | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate yielded one of the more caricatured moments in the presidential race thus far. Katherine Fenton, a 24-year-old pre-kindergarten teacher from Floral Park, N.Y., <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/us/politics/transcript-of-the-second-presidential-debate-in-hempstead-ny.html?pagewanted=all\">asked</a>, \u201cIn what new ways do you intend to rectify inequalities in the workplace? Specifically regarding females making only 72 percent of what their male counterparts earn.\u201d In his response, Mitt Romney said that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/us/politics/transcript-of-the-second-presidential-debate-in-hempstead-ny.html?pagewanted=all\">\u201cbinders full of women\u201d</a> were integral to his hiring practices when he took office as governor of Massachusetts in 2002.</span></p> <p><span>Romney\u2019s focus on the composition of his staff eschewed Fenton\u2019s question. Indeed, while President Obama responded by noting his support for the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and expanded Pell Grants, Fenton has lamented that neither candidate answered her question. Yet the former governor\u2019s claim that he went to his staff and said, \u201cwell, gosh, can\u2019t we\u2014can\u2019t we find some\u2014some women that are also qualified?\u201d is a gross simplification of the challenges facing women in the workforce.</span></p> <p><span>That the \u201cbinders full of women\u201d comment has gained cultural salience is undoubtedly a consequence of Romney\u2019s response. Yet he reinforced his statement with a critique of the Obama administration: \u201cIn the\u2014in the last four years, women have lost 580 thousand jobs. That\u2019s the net of what\u2019s happened in the last four years. We\u2019re still down 580 thousand jobs. I mentioned three and a half million women more now in poverty than four years ago.\u201d Despite his emphasis on job loss, Romney <a href=\"http://factcheck.org/2012/10/factchecking-the-hofstra-debate/\">severely misapprehended the facts</a>. Romney\u2019s figure is a full six times the actual number of women that have lost work since Obama took office. Romney also points his finger at the wrong administration. While a disproportionate number of the job losses since the President\u2019s term began have affected women, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303624004577340190482424090.html\">the recession took its deepest toll</a> under George Bush. Between January 2008 and January 2009, when Obama was inaugurated, 3.26 million men and 1.6 million women lost their jobs.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, economic downturns have a far more nuanced effect on women. The male-dominated industries of construction, finance, and manufacturing are particularly vulnerable in volatile markets, and when these jobs are lost, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120146408\">women often unexpectedly assume the role of household breadwinner</a>. Yet just as Fenton noted, these women often work for wages significantly less than those of their male counterparts. Furthermore, the cuts in government spending that define post-recession policies impact jobs in education, government, and healthcare, fields overwhelmingly populated by women. Of the 2.6 million jobs created since the end of the recession in 2009, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/15/business/la-fi-men-women-jobs-20120715\">80 percent have gone to men</a>, signaling that women struggle to re-enter the workforce.</span></p> <p><span>Women are not simply struggling to be selected out of a group\u2014or binder full\u2014of qualified applicants for a job. Women outnumber men in the American workforce, but women still receive fewer promotions than men, are less likely to serve in executive positions, and face potentially compromising choices over maternity leave. To tackle these issues is not the preserve of cut-and-dry economic policy. Both Obama and Romney\u2019s answers failed to confront the paradigm shift necessary to fully tackle the issues of work and gender that our nation faces.</span></p> <p><span>Although Romney\u2019s response advocated for more flexible work schedules, changes that promote enlightened notions of family balance and pay equality are beyond the purview of hiring practices. As the children of working mothers, we understand the importance of balancing family and career obligations. Yet a woman\u2019s choice to or not to work has little bearing on her abilities as a mother. Rather, it is ensuring equality of opportunity, and access to contraception, education, family leave, healthcare, and wage equality for both women and<i> </i>men that will lead to a reinvention of our ideas on work and family.</span></p> <p><span><i>Maura D.

{"title": "Nobel, Noble No More | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>One has to wonder if the members of Norwegian Nobel Committee purposely try to select the most unlikely recipients for the Nobel Peace Prize. I doubt a single person predicted that the European Union would <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/world/nobel-peace-prize.html?pagewanted=all\">win the award</a> on October 12, and the reaction following the announcement was near-universal puzzlement. On Twitter\u2014the forum that passes for public opinion these days\u2014jokes about the award <a href=\"http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/on-twitter-confusion-and-chuckles-over-nobel-peace-prize/\">quickly circulated</a>. One user suggested that the EU should win the Prize in Chemistry for its austerity experiments in Greece.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe we should come to expect odd choices from Oslo. The reaction to this year\u2019s award feels <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/world/10nobel.html\">eerily similar</a> to that of three years ago, when the prize went to a newly elected and barely-tried President Obama. The Nobel Peace Prize increasingly seems like less of a clearly defined concept and more of a random lottery, and that\u2019s truly a shame. By continuously selecting unconventional winners for the Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee both tarnishes the prestige of this unique award and fails to inspire change in places where it is needed.</span></p> <p><span>In all fairness, it would be hard to claim that this year\u2019s prize went to an undeserving recipient. Alfred Nobel <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/\">intended</a> that the award go to the person or organization \u201cwho shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\u201d Europe certainly fits that description. Since the end of World War II, cooperation among European nations has transformed the continent from a landscape of recurring war to a place synonymous with peace and prosperity.</span></p> <p><span>European merits aside, however, this year\u2019s choice is still disquieting. By recognizing the long-term accomplishments of an entire continent, does the Nobel Committee make any difference in the world? With the EU in the grip of a crippling economic crisis that has pushed it to the brink of collapse, the award can be seen as a vote of confidence. However, it\u2019s doubtful that a vote of confidence from a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/world/europe/some-norwegians-dismayed-over-nobel-prize-for-european-union.html\">profoundly Eurosceptic</a> country will affect the outcome of a situation dependent on economic forces of staggering magnitude.</span></p> <p><span>Some might say that the point of the award is not to make a difference in the present world, but to recognize past achievements. Yet that misses the point entirely. The Nobel Prizes are often criticized for being <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/16/nobel-prize-staff/\">too politicized</a>, but peace, unlike literature or chemistry, is a fundamentally political concept. Whether the members of the deciding panel intend to make a political statement with the Peace Prize or not is irrelevant\u2014the award will always be interpreted as such.</span></p> <p><span>I, for one, find it absurd to think that one should recognize peace without actively promoting it. The members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee should realize that they are quite possibly the most influential activists in the world. With their votes, they can bring attention to issues that desperately need a spotlight. It\u2019s disappointing to see the ability to do good squandered, but it\u2019s even more frustrating to watch it happen time and time again.</span></p> <p><span>In <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/\">2006</a>, the prize went to Muhammed Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank, for his revolutionary innovations in microfinance that have helped millions escape poverty. A praiseworthy figure indeed, but how exactly did he help resolve any sort of conflict? <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/\">The following year</a>, the prize went to Al Gore \u201969 and the International Panel on Climate Change for promoting awareness of, well, climate change. For two years in a row, the award had only the slightest conceptual link to peace. Then came Obama\u2019s 2009 award, and now Europe gets the prize.

There are countless dissidents and activists around the world who put themselves in harm\u2019s way for the sake of their convictions\u2014people, for instance, like <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2010/\">2010</a>\u2019s recipient Liu Xiaobo, currently <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-19875389\">languishing</a> in a Chinese jail cell for promoting human rights, or <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/\">1991</a>\u2019s honoree, Burmese dissident Aung San Suu Kyi.

Yet the spirit of the prize is threatened by choices that\u2014as in the case of Al Gore\u2014only marginally have to do with peace or that\u2014as in the case of the EU\u2014fail to encourage peace and merely celebrate it in a feeble manner. By announcing winners such as these, the Nobel committee casts itself in a doubtful light. And if next year we see a genuine winner, that person\u2019s achievement will resonate a little less because we\u2019ve become accustomed to greeting the committee\u2019s announcement with skepticism, if not derision.</span></p> <p><span><i>Jorge A.

Harvard has historically accepted more undocumented students than other leading universities\u2014approximately five to eight every year\u2014according to Nicolas E. Jofre \u201913, a student activist and former president of Harvard\u2019s Act on a Dream, an undergraduate group that advocates for immigration reform.</span></p> <p><span>Who wins on November 6 could affect not only the fate of thousands of immigrants across the country, but also the status of undocumented students currently studying at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Both Obama and Romney have advocated for immigration reform. Both, however, offer significantly different philosophies and visions for the next four years.</span></p> <p><span>A DREAM, AND DEPORTATIONS, DEFERRED</span></p> <p><span>Since his campaign days in 2008, Obama has endorsed immigration reform that would create a road to citizenship for certain undocumented individuals.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe need immigration reform that will secure our borders, and punish employers who exploit immigrant labor; reform that finally brings the 12 million people who are here illegally out of the shadows by requiring them to take steps to become legal citizens,\u201d Obama said.</span></p> <p><span>In the early years of his tenure, Obama strongly supported the DREAM Act\u2014the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, formally, which offered a six-year-long path toward U.S. citizenship for some immigrants.</span></p> <p><span>The act found sympathy at higher education institutions across the nation. University President Drew G. Faust, along with several other university presidents, vigorously lobbied Capitol Hill for the passage of the DREAM Act, writing letters and making public statements in favor of the legislation.  Students, including Balderas, also voiced their support, some taking part in a rally at St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral in Boston.</span></p> <p><span>Despite these efforts, the DREAM Act was killed in the Senate in late 2010. Had it been passed into law, the legislation would have granted citizenship to about 40 undocumented students currently studying at Harvard, according to Anahi D. Mendoza Pacheco \u201915, current co-chair of Act on a Dream.</span></p> <p><span>The Obama administration, however, did take a step toward realizing its vision for immigration reform with an executive order last June that defers deportation and grants two-year work permits to undocumented students, veterans, and</span></p> <p><span>young people brought to the United States at an early age.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s not a permanent fix. This is a temporary, stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, riven, patriotic young people,\u201d Obama said. The policy has alleviated fears of deportation for undocumented students at Harvard, Mendoza said. Thousands of young undocumented immigrants from around the country have already submitted applications. However, Jacqueline Bhabha, Law School lecturer and University advisor on Human Rights Education, said she believes that Obama\u2019s deferred action plan may have been less than sincere, a pandering ploy aimed at Hispanic voters who now compose a growing portion of the electorate.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout his term in office, Obama has supported policy which make distinctions between undocumented immigrants with and without a criminal record. Obama backed DREAM Act legislation and ordered ICE not to deport some immigrants\u2014both measures applicable to undocumented individuals without criminal records.</span></p> <p><span>Obama has also asked enforcement officials to target undocumented workers convicted of crimes instead of conducting indiscriminate raids that separate families and punish children brought to the U.S. through no fault of their own.</span></p> <p><span>Despite advocates\u2019 high hopes for immigration reform when Obama first took office, the president has failed to enact substantial reforms, Bhabha said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe first four years of Obama\u2019s term have been extremely disappointing,\u201d she said, noting that deportations of undocumented immigrants have increased in number during the Obama administration.</span></p> <p><span>THE ROMNEY PLAN</span></p> <p><span>The policy shifts of the last four year may be reversed if Romney, who takes a harder stance on illegal immigration, wins the race for the Oval Office.</span></p> <p><span>Though Romney does not believe most undocumented immigrants should become citizens, he has endorsed, at times, granting permanent residence to some.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere are four million people who are waiting in line to get here legally,\u201d he said during the second presidential debate. Individuals who illegaly immigrated as children \u201cshould have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident,\u201d Romney added.</span></p> <p><span>At that same debate, Romney also said that he would instate an employment verification or \u201cE-Verify\u201d system, which would deny immigrants driver\u2019s licenses and would oppose amnesty for immigrants already living in the United States.</span></p> <p><span>Though Romney has not laid out a concrete plan, Romney said he wants to pursue comprehensive immigration reform at a campaign stop in Florida last summer.</span></p> <p><span>Romney\u2019s comments on illegal immigration did raise some eyebrows during a Republican primary debate in January 2012. On that night, Romney angered some Latino voters with his comments on self-deportation, calling it the best way to cope with the millions living illegally in the United States.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe answer is self-deportation, which is people decide they can do better by going home because they can\u2019t find work here because they don\u2019t have legal documentation to allow them to work here,\u201d Romney said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to round them up.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Romney has also said that, if elected, he would veto any legislation modeled after the DREAM Act, standing behind Senate Republicans who succeeded in blocking the passage of the legislation two years ago. He has promised to honor any applications for deferred action made between June and November, when Romney says he will discontinue the program if elected.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe people who have received the special visa that the president has put in place... should expect that the visa would continue to be valid,\u201d Romney said told The Hill in early October.</span></p> <p><span>The stagnant economic climate, however, has discouraged politicians from putting their political muscle behind pushing immigration reform. The presidential candidates themselves have focused on the lackluster economy and tepid job growth while on the campaign trail.</span></p> <p><span>With a weak economy weighing on the minds of Americans, the future of immigration reform is, therefore, \u201cvery difficult to predict,\u201d Bhabha said.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Laura K.

{"title": "An Arms Race | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As far as local economic stimulus goes, $60 million is not bad. That lofty figure is the combined sum that U.S. Senate candidates Elizabeth Warren and Scott Brown have <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/16/brown-warren-Senate-fundraising/\">raised</a> this for their campaigns this election cycle. Temporary boons to ad companies and political consultants aside, it is hard to see how this excessive spending benefits anybody in the long run. The Brown-Warren race demonstrates the absurdity of our current campaign-finance system. At this point, all the airtime is bought up, the radio-waves are saturated, and there\u2019s hardly a voter in the Commonwealth who couldn\u2019t recite each candidate\u2019s pitch by heart. Our current system of private campaign finance is a wild misallocation of resources that simply raises prices for consultants and ad production companies without any perceptible benefits for voters. We advocate widespread public finance reform, putting an end to this inefficient system.</span></p> <p><span>Needless to say, $60 million is far in excess of the socially optimal campaign cost for a single senate campaign in a state with only 4.2 million <a href=\"mailto:http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/08/28/registration-figures-show-massachusetts-voters-continue-abandon-two-major-political-parties/p0zW7Snj9R07DK913P36kM/story.html\">registered</a> voters. That breaks down to almost $15 in campaign spending per registered voter\u2014a candidate could probably purchase votes directly for less. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s far in excess of the average cost of a senate seat. From 1986 to 2010, average campaign <a href=\"mailto:http://www.cfinst.org/data/pdf/VitalStats_t1.pdf\">expenditure</a> on a senate seat hovered between $5 and $10 million\u2014well below the roughly $30 million per candidate this cycle.</span></p> <p><span>At its current level, it\u2019s not even clear that this much fund raising is benefiting the candidates. As political consultant Tom Domke <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/16/brown-warren-Senate-fundraising/\">notes</a>, \u201cThere\u2019s only so much TV or radio time they can buy.\u201d Indeed, private campaign finance has all the trappings of an arms race: Each party ups its arsenal of campaign funds for fear of being outspent without a clear advantage to either party. The result is that an inordinate amount of money is funneled into an activity whose only intrinsic value is, at best, making voters aware of candidates\u2019 platforms. In practice, insofar as this goal is fulfilled at all, it can happen well below $60 million dollars.</span></p> <p><span>Even if we choose not to approach the question of whether it is right for candidates with deep-pocketed donors to have an advantage in getting their message out, it\u2019s hard to see how the current system benefits either party. Going into a race, it\u2019s often hard to predict who will have the final cash advantage. Although Republicans are known for garnering donations (sometimes indirectly) of <a href=\"mailto:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/24/sheldon-adelson-donations_n_1910094.html\">jaw-dropping</a> proportions, Democrats have certainly <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story%3Fid=6397572%26page=1%23.UIB28HM4Nu0\">held</a> their own. In 2008, then-Senator Obama enjoyed the cash advantage, and he may well out-raise his opponent <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/campaign-finance\">again</a>. If neither party is the clear winner in the private fundraising rat-race, it\u2019s hard to see why either would be against widespread public finance reform.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, the great elephant in the room on this topic is Supreme Court precedent. Current case law holds that money is <a href=\"mailto:http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2010/0121/Supreme-Court-Campaign-finance-limits-violate-free-speech\">equivalent</a> to speech, a fact which makes campaign finance reform nearly impossible. While we support public finance, it would need to come part-and-parcel with a constitutional amendment reversing that line of precedent.</span></p>"}

Read </i><i><a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/18/federal-funding-science-research/\">Part II on research funding</a> </i><i>and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/19/obama-romney-immigration-debate/\">Part III on immigration</a>.</i></span></p> <p><span>The federal government\u2019s approach to higher education funding, particularly student financial aid, could change significantly with November\u2019s presidential election, potentially altering the way millions of students think about and pay for college.</span></p> <p><span>While Harvard undergraduates, who benefit from Harvard\u2019s own robust financial aid program, rely less on federal aid than students elsewhere and usually graduate with less debt, the University has a vested interest in national student aid policies nonetheless. Harvard spends hundreds of thousands of dollars annually to lobby Congress, the White House, and the Department of Education on a variety of issues, and education funding often figures prominently in those conversations. According to public filings made with the House of Representatives and the Senate, the University\u2019s efforts touched on Pell Grants, Perkins loans, Stafford loans, and other student aid issues in the first two quarters of 2012, in which Harvard spent $350,000 on lobbying overall.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe believe that a large reason why the United States has been a pillar\u2014really the leader internationally without argument in higher education\u201d is the robustness of its financial aid, said Harvard Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey, the University\u2019s chief lobbyist. \u201cWe worry about the erosion of some of those supports for students.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s very important, we think, as a principle, that there\u2019s enough support for students where they can make individual decisions to seek the kind of education that they\u2019re capable of achieving,\u201d Casey added. \u201cTherefore we think it\u2019s important for all students to feel they can afford to go wherever they can go.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>November\u2019s presidential election could determine the future finances of aid programs that make those choices possible.</span></p> <p><span><b>ONE PROBLEM, TWO PLANS FOR AID</b></span></p> <p><span>Democratic President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney have laid out two vastly different plans for how federal grant and loan programs would work in their respective administrations.</span></p> <p><span>Obama, who worked during his first term to expand grant funding and nationalize the student loan market, has pledged to keep interest rates low and to further expand Pell Grant eligibility and other federal tax credits for students. In his own plan, Romney has said he would restrict Pell Grants to those who most need them, re-privatize the college loan market, and rely on market forces moderate the rising cost of college education.</span></p> <p><span>The urgency of the debate over higher education aid bespeaks the ballooning of the student debt crisis, which for decades has been escalating alongside rising tuition costs. The president elected in November will face the largest student debt crisis in the country\u2019s history: nearly two-thirds of college students and recent graduates owe a combined $1 trillion to creditors.</span></p> <p><span>The candidates\u2019 respective approaches to the student debt crisis highlight their divergent views on the role of the federal government more broadly.</span></p> <p><span>Obama would increase funding for the Pell Grant program, which offers direct aid to the lowest-income students in the nation, and would raise the maximum amount awarded to individuals through the program. One of the country\u2019s most popular aid sources, Pell Grants currently go to more than 9 million students. The president would also make permanent the American Opportunity tax credit which his administration created in 2009 and which is set to expire in January.</span></p> <p><span>During his first term, the President instituted a \u201cPay As You Earn\u201d policy for federal loans, capping monthly payments to 15 percent of an individual\u2019s discretionary income. If re-elected, Obama has said, he would work to institute a policy forgiving all federal student loan debt after 20 years.</span></p> <p><span>Romney\u2019s education proposals, while less precise, lay out a vision for a leaner federal aid system more influenced by market forces. His education plan released in April, titled \u201cA Chance For Every Child,\u201d calls for the federal government to end the \u201cexpanding entitlement mentality\u201d that has arisen around direct aid programs like Pell Grants.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA Romney Administration will refocus Pell Grant dollars on the students that need them most and place the program on a responsible long-term path that avoids future funding cliffs and last-minute funding patches,\u201d the plan reads.</span></p> <p><span>Romney said he would re-introduce competition to the federal loan market by putting lending back into the private sector, which would undo the Obama administration\u2019s efforts.</span></p> <p><span>The plan says a Romney administration would \u201cfocus the Department on giving students and families with financial need the appropriate information about completion and persistence, loan repayment rates, future earnings, and other indicators to intelligently weigh the risks and benefits of the many options available to them, rather than limiting choices through punitive regulations.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Whether or not Romney would cut federal spending on education across the board is uncertain. In the first presidential debate two weeks ago he pledged to preserve existing spending levels.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m not going to cut education funding,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any plan to cut education funding and\u2014and grants that go to people going to college.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But analyses of the Republican\u2019s budget plan have shown Romney would cut education funding up to 20 percent. His running mate Paul D. Ryan\u2019s own budget, which Romney has supported in the past, would let the American Opportunity tax credit expire and cap Pell Grant funding at its current level with an eye toward further cuts.</span></p> <p><span><b>FOCUSED ON THE PRICE TAG</b></span></p> <p><span>Both candidates have pledged to address the rising cost of college education, which they both pinpoint as the root of the student debt problem. During the 2011-12 school year, tuition and fees for four-year colleges were expected to average $8,240 for public schools and $28,500 for private schools, according to the College Board, a private national organization that represents more than 6,000 colleges and universities. In the past five years, tuition costs have grown 5.1 percent annually beyond the inflation rate.</span></p> <p><span>In January, Obama proposed tying federal aid for Perkins loans and work-study subsidies to tuition in order to compel colleges to reign in costs if they hope to maintain federal subsidies. Though its sticker price ranks among the highest in the country, Harvard would not be subjected to funding cuts because its institutional financial aid program<a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/3/biden-harvard-financial-aid/\"> keeps what students pay low</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Similarly, Romney has said he would force universities to streamline costs. He said universities have had little incentive to make tuition more affordable with the influx of federal money under the Obama administration.</span></p> <p><span>Also potentially in the balance are interest rates on federal Stafford loans. Congress voted in June to stop interest rates for the popular loans from<a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/4/25/obama-conference-call-loans/\"> doubling to 6.8 percent</a>. Obama lowered the rate of the popular federal loans to 3.4 percent in 2009 and has pledged to keep it low if reelected. Ryan\u2019s budget calls for the higher rate, and Romney\u2019s statements on the question have been inconclusive.</span></p> <p><span><b>TAKING A STANCE, NOT A CANDIDATE</b></span></p> <p><span>Harvard\u2019s financial aid program, which gives grant aid to 60 percent of the student body, relies less on federal loans than other public and private universities. Still, roughly 25 percent of students elect to take additional federal aid, usually in the form of loans.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhile we cannot speculate on the impact of the election on federal support for student aid, it is clear the country is facing some critical fiscal challenges and that federal support for student aid and research could be substantially impacted by the decisions made in coming months and years,\u201d Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement. \u201cPresident [Drew G.] Faust, along with many of her colleagues, has <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/5/26/harvard-faust-university-washington/\">worked hard in Washington </a>to remind policymakers of the value of the federal partnership with universities in support of the next generation of leaders, innovators and new ideas to fuel the economy.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Former University President Derek C. Bok said a university like Harvard must actively promote generous grant and loan policies for the good of colleges as a whole.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAll thinking people at Harvard ought to recognize that as far as higher education is concerned, it is quite important,\u201d Bok said. \u201cI hope that Harvard will always feel a certain special concern for higher education generally, whether its specific ox is being gored or not.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Nicholas P.

{"title": "An Offensive Voice | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The Harvard Voice, a group on campus that runs a satire blog called \u201cNoice,\u201d has <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/15/students-react-blog-voice/\">come under critique</a> for a post that appeared on its blog last week. The post, entitled \u201c<a href=\"http://verynoice.com/2012/10/5-people-youll-see-at-pre-interview-receptions/\" title=\"5 People You\u2019ll See at Pre-Interview Receptions\">5 People You\u2019ll See at Pre-Interview Receptions</a>,\u201d attempted to present a \u201csatirical\u201d take on the types of people who turn up to on-campus recruiting events. The author unfortunately included the category \u201cThe Asian,\u201d noting that Asian Harvard students at recruiting events all dress similarly and are \u201cpractically indistinguishable from one another, but it\u2019s okay.\u201d A few days after it was originally published, the post <a href=\"http://verynoice.com/2012/10/5-people-youll-see-at-pre-interview-receptions/\">remains</a>, but the second category has been changed to \u201cThe Super-Interviewee.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Of the many ridiculous elements of this situation, one was the litany of editors\u2019 notes and unexplained corrections that appeared on the blog post in succession. For example, the author of the piece was changed from \u201cThe Voice Staff\u201d to the not-much-more-elucidating \u201cAnonymous.\u201d The Voice also published different versions of an editors\u2019 note while it repeatedly revised the article to edit out racist content. Notably, the author of the piece also left a comment, which read in part, \u201cClearly, I\u2019ve been censored, which in itself is an interesting reflection on free speech in America. If you couldn\u2019t tell that this article was satire, then we have bigger problems than me being \u2018offensive.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Although this particular post has come to national media attention\u2014perhaps in part because of the editors\u2019 ridiculously poor ability to recognize and handle offensive writing\u2014this kind of satire is not new to the Voice\u2019s blog. For example, a post written last year <a href=\"http://verynoice.com/2011/04/ten-guys-youll-meet-at-harvard/\">entitled</a> \u201cTen Guys You\u2019ll Meet at Harvard\u201d joked about \u201cThe one who\u2019s gay\u201d that \u201cThe Harvard homosexual guy is well-dressed, charming, good-looking, smart and\u00a0<i>gets</i> you\u2026 Except that it\u2019s physiologically impossible. Unless you drug him or something.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Every publication should strive to exclude content that is explicitly or implicitly oppressive, be it, for example, racist, sexist, or homophobic. Of course, The Crimson has not always been perfect itself in this regard\u2014for example, as news writer\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1208247/Amy_L._Weiss-Meyer/\">Amy</a> L. Weiss-Meyer noted in her story about the blog post controversy, the Crimson <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/15/students-react-blog-voice/\">published</a> an offensive endpaper about ten years ago that made similar generalizations about Asians on campus. Promulgating racial stereotypes, even in the name of humor, promotes a wider social fragmentation that is sadly very real on campus. And it should be clear that neither the ethnicity of nor the intent at humor by an author matter if the content produced simply serves to reinforce the kind of problematic stereotypes that oppress groups of people.</span></p> <p><span>Importantly, a paper or publication redacting offensive content, or refusing to publish it in the first place, is not a limitation of anyone\u2019s free speech. The writer who penned a \u201cnote from the writer\u201d\u2014and others who have protested that \u201ccensoring\u201d offensive content by refusing to publish it is a limitation of freedom\u2014demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of the idea of free speech as well as a poor standard of journalism. A publication has the right to decide what kind of speech or writing is acceptable for inclusion. Deciding not to publish or to remove oppressive content is not an inhibition of anyone\u2019s free speech, and is an important measure for editors who strive to make their publications decent, just, and well-respected.</span></p> <p><span>We do appreciate the apology posted <a href=\"http://verynoice.com/2012/10/a-response-to-the-5-people-situation/\">yesterday</a> on the Voice\u2019s blog by the Voice\u2019s co-president and editor, April A. Sperry '13. The apology noted, \u201cThe Voice\u00a0is not always politically correct, but it never actively aims to hurt or insult. Snarky and pithy writing is amusing\u2014offensive writing is not\u2026 hyperbole, humor, and social commentary can all happen without singling out a person or group of people. Talking pejoratively about Asian students in the recruiting process was both unnecessary and uncalled for.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>We agree with Sperry that there are plenty of ways to do satire that are not offensive yet <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/25/Romney-throwing-election/\">still funny</a>. Unfortunately, it seems that the writers of the Voice haven\u2019t caught on to them. Of course, there are also ways to attempt to do satire that simply aren\u2019t funny at all. If that\u2019s your thing, you might want to comp the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.</span></p> <p><span>No matter what, though, campus publications and their writers should not publish racist or otherwise oppressive commentary. Like it or not, one does hear these kinds of stereotypes in the Harvard community. The fact that Noice\u2019s post has brought this problem to national attention makes it an all the more unfortunate contribution to discourse at Harvard.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Subsidiarity: A Principle for the 25 Percent | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last Thursday\u2019s vice-presidential debate, tense and punctuated by unsportsmanlike interjections and guffaws, was more than a critical contest in this (now) close election. For the 25 percent of Americans who identify as Catholic, it was a historic showdown between two men with radically different conceptions of how to live out their Catholic faith in the public sphere. Moderator Martha Raddatz addressed this conflict in her penultimate <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/vice-presidential-debate-transcript-danvilel-ky-oct-11/story?id=17457175&amp;page=13#.UHs9YTmjJE8\">question</a>: \u201cTell me what role your religion has played in your own personal views on abortion.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>While the issue of abortion has certainly cost the Democratic Party the votes of socially conservative Catholics who consider the issue paramount, it\u2019s not the only point at which the Democratic platform sharply diverges from Catholic social principles. The Catholic Church draws a crucial distinction between its teachings in matters of faith and the principles of prudential judgment required to apply these teachings to political concerns. Two other ways in which the Democratic platform\u2019s ideals conflict with moral principles of the Catholic Church are in subsidiarity and individual charity. The Party insists on undermining structures of civil society and proposes to substitute redistributivism for the virtue of charity.</span></p> <p><span>The DNC\u2019s assertion that \u201cgovernment is the only thing we all belong to\u201d reveals a profound indifference to those institutions that stand between the federal government and the individual and bind us together in more personal ways than national citizenship. This has been evidenced by Obama\u2019s attacks on these institutions, most infamously to those Catholic hospitals unwilling to provide access to sterilizations, abortions, and contraception through the HHS Mandate<a href=\"http://www.zenit.org/article-35309?l=english\">. Pope Benedict XVI</a> expressed his concern about \u201cthe efforts [that] are being made to redefine and restrict the exercise of the right to religious freedom,\" here referring to the HHS Mandate (no matter <a href=\"http://www.usccb.org/news/2012/12-163.cfm\">what Biden says</a> about it). <b> </b></span></p> <p><span>Despite the clarity of life issues and the weakness of Biden\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/12/7/abortion-pro-life/\">personally pro-life</a> but pro-choice position,\u201d some Catholics have argued this election that the Democrats have a claim to moral superiority in their care for the poor through increased government welfare programs. This was most notably characterized in recent months by the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/sister-simone-campbell-nun-from-the-bus-calls-gop-budget-immoral/2012/09/06/d815e19c-f867-11e1-a93b-7185e3f88849_story.html\">\u201cNuns on a Bus\u201d</a> movement, an attack on Paul Ryan\u2019s budget proposals as violating the Church\u2019s principle of the necessity to care for the poor. But Paul Ryan\u2019s budget does not neglect the poor: it encourages them to provide for themselves instead of instead of beginning a dependence on government welfare that may last for generations. And seeks to allow people in communities to care for each other, instead of sending their money to the government in taxes and having it funneled through bureaucratic inefficiencies before being sent back to those in need. Finally, it recognizes that there are many difficulties facing the poor, not all of which can alleviated by government aid.</span></p> <p><span>In both of these cases, the Democratic assumption is that it is the federal government\u2019s job to care for the people, which directly contradicts the Catholic principle of subsidiarity, the idea that affairs should be conducted at a level as localized as possible. Pope Pius XI first introduced this as an important element of Catholic social thought in his encyclical <a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19310515_quadragesimo-anno_en.html\">Quadragesimo Anno</a>, 1931. John Paul II was expanding on this, in a way, when he said, \u201cso goes the family\u2026. so goes the world in which we live.\u201d The family is the center of Catholic society, the primary economic and provisional care unit. When a family lacks something, it can nearly always be better aided by other families in the community than by the state, and by the state than by the federal government. But the federal government should only undertake what cannot be provided for at these other levels.</span></p> <p><span>All of this is not to say that the Republican Party abides by the principle of subsidiarity perfectly. It doesn\u2019t\u2014but its platform at least is not in direct conflict with it. When one looks at the tendencies of the Democratic Party both to force American Catholics to violate their Catholic principles through actions like the HHS mandate and excessive federal welfare programs and to disobey directly Catholic moral teaching on issues like abortion and same sex marriage, it\u2019s a wonder that Catholics are a 25 percent divided and that a vice-presidential debate with two Catholics can even happen at all.</span></p> <p><span><b> </b></span></p> <p><span><i>Aurora C.

This week:</i> <i>Nina J. Easton.</i></span></p> <p><span>\"Presidential coverage used to be a very serious endeavor,\" said self-described pundit Nina J. Easton from behind her desk at the Kennedy School's Institute of Politics.  \"There still are pockets of that attitude, especially among old school vets, but the culture is to get [the news] out there fast.\"</span></p> <p><span>As an IOP fellow this semester, Easton is trying for the opposite approach. By slowing down to examine the economics at play in the 2012 election, she's aiming to provide a substantive supplement to the media's superficial look at politics.</span></p> <p><span>Her study group, named \"It's the Economy Stupid!\" after a Bill Clinton campaign mantra, meets on Tuesdays from 4 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. in the Faculty Dining Room at the IOP.  Each week, Easton brings in a high profile visitor to analyze the latest developments in the election. Her guests include Harvard economist and Mitt Romney adviser N. Gregory Mankiw, J.P. Morgan general counsel Gregory A. Baer, GOP pollster Bill McInturff, a Democratic political operative Elaine C. Kamarck, economic policy strategist David M. Smick, and former National Economic Council Director Larry H. Summers.</span></p> <p><span>In an era of tweets and sound bytes, guardedness is the rule for political power players. Not so in Easton's study group. \"The great thing is the study groups are off the record,\" Easton said. \"The guests can be truly candid.\"</span></p> <p><span>Easton, author of two books, frequent panelist on Fox News, senior editor at Fortune Magazine, and co-chair of Fortune's annual Most Powerful Women Summit, has recused herself from covering this election because her husband is a senior adviser to the Romney campaign. So when Harvard recruited her to participate in two semester-long fellowships, she packed up and moved to Cambridge last winter.</span></p> <p><span>Last spring as a Goldsmith Fellow at the Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center, Easton researched Americans' attitudes toward the rich in the face of growing income inequality. \"I was troubled by the superficial look the media was taking,\" she said. \"The media did not quote unquote 'discover' income inequality until Occupy Wall Street brilliantly put it into the political lexicon.\" Her research resulted in a Fortune cover story asking \"Is It Still OK To Be Rich in America?\"</span></p> <p><span>Despite her conservative leanings, Easton sees the value in understanding a variety of political perspectives, and she has made an effort to represent views from across the political spectrum in her study group. At least two liberal guests (Kamarck and Summers) will help provide study group attendees with a balanced view of the economy's role in the election.</span></p> <p><span>Easton wishes editors would make the same conscious effort and hire writers of diverse political views. A Berkeley liberal before she became disenchanted with entitlement programs and affirmative action, Easton thinks her media colleagues report the news with a leftist slant.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's really important whether you're a conservative or a liberal to always challenge the conventional wisdom, which is what I've tried to do in all my work,\" she said.</span></p> <p><span>Easton's phone buzzed a few times during our interview, and she checked it \"just in case it's my babysitter\" texting her about Ellie, her four-year-old in the Radcliffe Child Care Center. As a working mother of three, Easton said, \"I've made decisions along the way so I would be there for my kids, and it's kept me from going places I would have gone.\"</span></p> <p><span>Sharon M. Stovezky '15, one of Easton's community liaisons, said she applied for the post because \"I am very interested in getting to know women in positions of power, and she's one of the few in Washington journalism.\"</span></p> <p><span>Easton's six community liaisons meet with her once a week outside of the study group and help to advertise the events to the undergraduate community.

{"title": "Women's Issues Key in Massachusetts Senate Race | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>With only two weeks until election day, women\u2019s issues have become the latest and perhaps final flashpoint in Massachusetts\u2019s much-watched U.S. Senate race, providing insight into both campaigns\u2019 strategy and encapsulating much of the derision that has characterized the contest thus far.</span></p> <p><span>The debate surrounding women\u2019s issues, which has emerged at various points during the race, reclaimed center stage a week and half ago during a debate between the candidates in Springfield.</span></p> <p><span>Though the political conversation has focused on U.S. Senator Scott Brown\u2019s stances on a number of key issues affecting women, more important to the campaigns is how the debate may influence the demographics of voters showing up to the polls on Election Day, political strategists say.</span></p> <p><span>In the Oct. 10 debate, Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren attacked Brown for voting against equal pay for equal work, insurance coverage for contraception, and against the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe didn\u2019t offer an amendment to say \u2018here\u2019s what we can do to make this better,\u2019\u201d Warren said in a conference call with college journalists. \u201cHe just voted in lockstep with the other Republicans to say no....And those are bad votes for women.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Brown, who is a moderate Republican, said he voted against the bills in question because they were bad legislation, not because he does not support women.</span></p> <p><span>Since the debate, the argument has spilled over into advertisements and onto the campaign trail as both sides have tried to make their case to women, Massachusetts\u2019s dominant voting group. On Monday, Brown received the endorsement of Laurie Myers, a leading advocate for female abuse victims, and pledged to be an advocate for women in the Senate.</span></p> <p><span>Warren spent the weekend campaigning with U.S. Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota, raising awareness about Brown\u2019s voting record and advocating for equal rights for women and the LGBTQ community.</span></p> <p><span>But political strategists say the back and forth has more to do with the broader electoral goals of each campaign than with the issues themselves.</span></p> <p><span>For Warren, women\u2019s issues are a chance to excite her own base and tie Brown to the national Republican Party.</span></p> <p><span>For Brown, whose base consists of male voters, capturing the votes of certain segments of independent women will be key to winning the heavily Democratic Bay State.</span></p> <p><span>Former Boston City Councillor Lawrence S. Dicara \u201971 said that the focus on women is part of a larger effort by Warren\u2019s campaign to optomize voter turnout. Historically, higher voter turnout in Massachusetts translates to a more female and more Democratic electorate\u2014which means more votes for Warren.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWarren\u2019s trying to create a wedge between Brown and women voters that she can use to get more women to the polls,\u201d said Republican political consultant Rob Gray.</span></p> <p><span>Tying Brown to the national GOP and to former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney could push those tallies even higher, Gray said. Massachusetts is expected to overwhelmingly support Democratic President Barack Obama, but turnout is also expected to fall from 2008 levels as excitement around the presidential race wanes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe presidential race in this blue state can and does trickle down to Senate races,\u201d Gray said. \u201c[The Warren camp\u2019s] hope is that voters conclude that Brown is just like Romney and vote a straight ticket Democrat.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Brown\u2019s campaign has worked hard to resist that link, DiCara said, but the association may be hard to shake. Even as Brown has shown himself to be a strong advocate of women, his party\u2019s stances on abortion and affirmative action may undercut his efforts to paint himself as progressive representative for women.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cScott Brown himself is probably okay on women\u2019s issues,\u201d DiCara said. \u201cThe real issue is not Scott Brown, but it\u2019s the people who will end up having the gavels in the Senate if the Republicans have a majority.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Though Brown will need to attract the votes of blue-collar women who tend to vote Democratic in order to win, his success is still largely dependent on men\u2019s votes.</span></p> <p><span>The same gender gap that gives Warren a leg up among women, gives Republicans like Brown and advantage among me, Gray said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf he can drive up the number of white males that are supporting him that will help him against Warren\u2019s advantage among female voters,\u201d said Democratic political consultant Dan Payne.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Nicholas P.

Paci and Alexander White stood at the center of the Harvard Kennedy School courtyard early Monday morning armed with 8 wooden rods and forty binders.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe don\u2019t have permission to do this,\u201d White said with a grin, hammering a wooden rod into the ground and stacking three binders around it.</span></p> <p><span>Paci and White, who worked with fellow Kennedy School students Blake Hyatt and Helena V. Pylvainen, said they put up an \u201cartistic\u201d binder display just outside their school\u2019s main entrance to call for a diversification of Kennedy School faculty.</span></p> <p><span>The students wrote phrases such as \u201cat least Romney had binders\u201d and \u201ctake responsibility for faculty diversity\u201d on the binders.

Paci said that once they heard it, they knew they had to use it.</span></p> <p><span>White added that while it was \u201cfunny that Mitt Romney is being criticized for this, the HKS record is even worse.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe should laugh about it, but at the same time we should recognize that this is happening in our own backyard,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Ideas to use Romney\u2019s slip-up for what Paci said was a more \u201cproductive cause\u201d surfaced at a diversity mixer hosted last week by the Kennedy School Diversity Committee, a faculty-student group. There, the four students began planning what they called the \u201cbinder protest\u201d.

At the time, there were no black professors at the Kennedy School.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty horrible,\u201d Paci said. \u201cIf the Kennedy school is a pipeline to government or a world leadership position, we need to have women in that pipeline.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In response to the protest, Kennedy School Dean David T.

With the rise of the Tea Party, this became the GOP\u2019s favorite form of ammunition against President Barack Obama.</span></p> <p><span>Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney makes the argument <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/29/nation/la-na-europe-campaign-20120630\">repeatedly</a> on the campaign trail. Romney <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/29/nation/la-na-europe-campaign-20120630\">warns</a> that Obama \u201cwants to turn America into a European-style social welfare state.\u201d In the primaries Romney, displaying his characteristic knack for pandering, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUv28wS81Fc\">insisted</a>, \u201cGuess what. Europe isn't working in Europe. It\u2019s not going to work here. I believe in America.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Romney gives the impression that Europe is one big glob of a failed state. It\u2019s easy for Americans to forget sometimes, but Europe is in fact 27 different nations, each with its own unique culture, government, and social system. Simply criticizing \u201cEurope\u201d suggests someone more interested in scoring cheap political points than seriously evaluating other countries\u2019 policies.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, it isn\u2019t at all apparent that Europe isn\u2019t working in Europe. Maybe Romney thinks the current debt crisis is proof that large welfare states are unsustainable, leading to spiraling deficits and high unemployment.</span></p> <p><span>Greek profligacy certainly contributed to the current crisis. And, like us, Europeans are wrestling with how to reconcile commitments to the elderly and vulnerable with an aging population.</span></p> <p><span>But other embattled countries like <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/martin-wolf-exchange/2012/06/25/what-was-spain-supposed-to-have-done/#axzz1zOWitspa\">Spain</a> and <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/european-crisis-realities/\">Ireland</a> were actually running surpluses prior to the bursting of the real estate bubble. In Germany, where social spending is actually <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/european-crisis-realities/\">higher</a> as a percentage of GDP than in Greece, unemployment is at <a href=\"http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=country:de&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=germany+unemployment\">5.5%</a> while deficit spending in 2011 was <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/obeying-eu-rules-german-budget-deficit-plunges-to-1-percent-of-gdp-a-817363.html\">1%</a> of GDP.

Other parts of Europe are working better than America is, in certain respects. The 30-second ad frenzy we call our campaign season isn\u2019t known for subtleties like these, of course. What is disturbing, however, is that is that the GOP mainstream seems to have actually adopted the philosophy that borrowing ideas from other counties, even highly successful countries with happy citizens, is wrong.</span></p> <p><span>Many Republicans think Europeans (and Democrats) want to have their cake and eat it too because, the argument goes, robust economies are incompatible with generous states. Ignoring countries that have successfully combined the two, like <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67899/steven-rattner/the-secrets-of-germanys-success\">Denmark</a> and <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67899/steven-rattner/the-secrets-of-germanys-success\">Germany</a>, allows the GOP to maintain the illusion that their policies are the only policies that have ever worked in history. All Americans need to do, they argue, is put aside their emotions and do the logical thing.</span></p> <p><span>But reality is a little less black and white. Low-tax, low-spending governments are sustainable, but so are high-tax, high-spending governments, within limits. What point America chooses on the spectrum in between is a function not just of logic but of values, principles, and emotions. It\u2019s messy. To make these difficult choices informed ones, Americans should at least be able to depend on their leaders to present accurate characterizations of countries that have struck balances different than our own.</span></p> <p><span>Echoing Romney, Reince Priebus, Chairman of the National Republican Party, recently <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yiet_fyN_ng\">complained</a> that Obama is \u201clooking to Europe for guidance\u201d for his policies. Maybe I\u2019m na\u00efve, but given the magnitude of the problems we face right now, shouldn\u2019t we be casting as wide a net as possible for solutions? I don\u2019t just want Obama looking to Europe for guidance, I want him looking to every country on Earth for ideas on how to do things better.</span></p> <p><span>The idea that we should deliberately fail to learn from other countries is a recipe for national decline. South Korean teenagers <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2011/2011004.pdf\">vastly outscore</a> American teenagers on math, reading, and science tests. \u00a0Japan <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthfund.org/News/News-Releases/2012/May/US-Spends-Far-More-for-Health-Care-Than-12-Industrialized-Nations-but-Quality-Varies.aspx\">spends</a> 9% of GDP on healthcare to our 17%, without sacrificing quality. Canadians are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/us/harder-for-americans-to-rise-from-lower-rungs.html?pagewanted=all\">more socially mobile</a> than Americans. These are causes for hope, not despair. We\u2019re being shown the way forward. If we want this to be another American century, we need to learn from these examples, not pretend they don\u2019t exist because they clash with our preferred worldview.</span></p> <p><span>Republicans insist that America needs \u201cAmerican solutions.\u201d But what exactly does that mean? Surely not doing things more expensively or poorly than we need to because a political party refuses to admit a mistake (something Democrats are also guilty of).</span></p> <p><span>This country was not built by people too proud to learn from others.

According to Assistant Professor Ryan D. Enos of the Government Department, who conducted the 2009 study, he and his team of researchers gleaned their findings from a pool of undergraduates in California in 2007. Though Enos claims that their preferences are consistent with those found in any large group\u2014Americans or foreigners, young or old\u2014their West Coast location helped minimize familiarity with the faces of the faraway politicians whose images were flashed. To further reduce the role of bias in the undergraduates' judgment, Enos and his team took out any faces the students recognized. When asked to judge the competency of political figures based on appearance alone, these students put Romney in the 99th\u00a0percentile of governors.</span></p> <p><span><b>Q:</b> Romney vs. Ryan?</span></p> <p><span><b>A:</b> Ryan, a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79632.html\">supposed hottie</a>, was in the 67th\u00a0percentile... awkward. Though the two men were in separate categories within the study (House Members and Governors) and Enos said the point of the research was not to rank politicians, he also said that sometimes there is a clear winner. \"My assumption is that if Mitt Romney is in the 99th\u00a0percentile of governors he's probably way better looking than Ryan,\" Enos said.</span></p> <p><span><b> </b></span></p> <p><span><b>Q: </b>So what about Obama?</span></p> <p><span><b>A:</b> Too recognizable; not included in the study. Biden, however, placed in the 62nd\u00a0percentile. \"Better looking than average. But not as good looking as Ryan or Romney,\" Enos explained.</span></p> <p><span><b> </b></span></p> <p><span><b>Q:</b> How will this effect the 2012 election?</span></p> <p><span><b>A:</b> It probably won't. \"Only under very particular circumstances, among a small group of [independent voters] will you see this effect,\" Enos said. In fact, the researchers found that not once in the 15-year period they examined was attractiveness or perceived competence enough to change the outcome of a senate race.</span></p> <p><span>So for what it's worth, you now have the respective hotness levels of Romney and Ryan.

Ah, the numbers.</span></p> <p><span>Nonpartisan sites like Factcheck.org and Politifact.com are littered with reports of faulty figures, like Indiana <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/25/mitch-daniels/mitch-daniels-says-nearly-half-all-persons-under-3/\">Governor Mitch E.

Haggerty cites a telling example, drawn from Damned Lies and Statistics by Joel Best. In the 1980s, reports swirled of 50,000 abducted, \u201cmissing children\u201d in America. As big numbers are wont to do, the statistics spawned action\u2014police databases, television programming, PSAs, and more. Unfortunately, the words \u201cmissing\u201d (i.e. not momentarily out of sight) and \u201cchildren\u201d (i.e. not adults) had both been skewed. Subsequent analysis readjusted the total from 50,000 to 70, and the scare passed.</span></p> <p><span>The number 50,000 wouldn\u2019t work today. Thousands are irksome. Millions, for now, are good. Billions are better. And trillions, of course, are best. In a telling number-chase, BarackObama.com <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/romney-tax-plan/\">claims</a> Mr. Romney would levy $2000 in new taxes from each middle class family. Of course, 2000 is a small number, so the web page displays the nine-figure total of targeted U.S. middle-class families above\u2014in much larger font\u2014with its impressive digit triplets and commas. I wish we could find comfort in the old aphorism, \u201cStatistics are for losers.\u201d But that\u2019s not logically possible. Statistics cannot possibly be reserved for losers. Not when A) everyone is slinging them and B) someone has to win.</span></p> <p><span>And even if the statistics are right, what next? Is their message effective, in a constructive way? Maybe not. When CNN <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/01/cnn-poll-americans-flunk-budget-iq-test/\">polled</a> for estimates of federal spending on 10 major programs, respondents placed the spending 50 percent above the actual level, an error worth hundreds of billions of hotly debated dollars. According to an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/std/leadingindicatorsandtendencysurveys/37389519.pdf\">report</a>, \u201cIn several countries, a large majority of people believed that that actual inflation rate was between 50 percent and 100 percent, while official estimates indicated [inflation] rates between 2 percent and 3 percent.\u201d (That\u2019s a scary gap. At 2-3 percent rates, smart investors buy a few-percent certificate deposit or money market shares. At 50-100 percent rates, they start a cash-for-gold shop.) Mr. Haggerty suggests a core problem, that \u201ccitizens are inundated on a daily basis with untold numbers of statistical facts, making it impossible to develop a critical appreciation for all but a few these numbers.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Two points of caution, however. For one, public ignorance isn\u2019t the real issue. A Platonic team of experts won\u2019t solve our problem. (Who\u2019s experts?\u2014FDR\u2019s or Reagan\u2019s? Bush\u2019s? Obama\u2019s? Ralph Nader\u2019s, maybe, if he has any? Even the numbers-guys can\u2019t agree on much.) \u00a0Today, the alleged experts fling numbers more than anyone. And anyway, it was Plato himself who wrote, \u201cA good decision is based on knowledge and not on numbers.\u201d (Plato, admittedly, had never heard of logistic regression.) Second, anti-intellectualism isn\u2019t the answer either. Numbers and statistics\u2014like the inflation rate discussed above\u2014are still powerful and informative, and they can tell us a lot about the world. It\u2019s merely that they cannot, and should not, tell us whom to vote for in November.</span></p> <p><span>Why not? After all, this election is about budgets and fiscal strategies\u2014about the numbers. But statistics only carry us as far as our ideals propel them. This election is really about fundamentals\u2014about the state, its citizens, and their intersection. Fifteen-plus trillion dollars in debt poses Armageddon to a fiscal hawk, but won\u2019t phase a strong Keynesian. Tax cuts on \u201cmillionaires and billionaires,\u201d to borrow the president\u2019s numerical rhetoric, are sound to a conservative and anathema to Mr. Obama. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.</span></p> <p><span>We need to emphasize the ideas behind the veil of digits. It\u2019s tempting to long for an apolitical approach, attention only to facts and numbers and statistics. It\u2019s especially tempting in the face of ideologies that seem to have failed us. But numbers are an empty bastion for the wayward. The onus is on us to fill in the ideas and the values, the substance. I just wish I had a good statistic to prove it.</span></p> <p><span><i>Brian L.

{"title": "The Democratic Spine | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For Democrats and unaffiliated liberals, the past four years have been a disappointing slog in which Republicans have controlled the political narrative on nearly every major issue.</span></p> <p><span>Healthcare reform became Obamacare, replete with death panels. The debate over the debt ceiling became a criticism of the stimulus package. The recent decision to let states determine welfare work requirements, a proposal that almost sounds Republican, became the dismantling of the American work ethic.</span></p> <p><span>In terms of communication, the Democrats have demonstrated a stunning and stupefying inability to defend themselves against an efficient, ruthless, and effective Republican machine.</span></p> <p><span>These recent losses have created a sizable group of disillusioned Democrats and frustrated independents shocked and dismayed by the party\u2019s incompetence. As a result, many members of the liberal base, from fervent party supporters to liberal centrists, have become politically apathetic.</span></p> <p><span>This is why the Democratic Party could never create a movement parallel to the Tea Party. This is why the Democratic Party could not mobilize the support of the Occupy Movement. And this is why the Democratic Party received a political bludgeoning during the 2010 midterm elections.</span></p> <p><span>If this ineptitude continued, the Democratic Party would cease to matter as a political entity.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, the Democratic National Convention last week showed a party energized, eloquent, and finally ready to rebuff the rhetoric of the Republicans.</span></p> <p><span>It started on Tuesday night with an inspired speech by Massachusetts governor Deval L. Patrick \u201978 (Full disclosure: I am currently an intern in the Governor\u2019s press office). In his address, Patrick <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/04/deval-patrick-speech-text_n_1852774.html?utm_hp_ref=elections-2012\">called</a> for \u201cDemocrats to stiffen [their] backbone and stand up for what [they] believe.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Even better, he actually stated those beliefs in a way that directly countered recent Republican criticisms.</span></p> <p><span>The disillusioned have waited four years for that speech, beginning with the speeches of a certain Presidential candidate whose rhetorical skill seemingly disappeared when he entered the oval office.</span></p> <p><span>The articulation and defense of Democratic ideals then became a major theme of the convention.</span></p> <p><span>President Bill Clinton almost restored the Democratic message singlehandedly, delivering a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/80808.html\">speech</a> uniquely Clintonian in its length and more substantive on policy than any other in recent memory.</span></p> <p><span>We can criticize the Democratic Party for its message, but we can no longer criticize it for not having one.</span></p> <p><span>However, the restoration of Democratic rhetoric may not change the tone of a campaign <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2012/06/obama-twists-romneys-economic-record/\">marred</a> by deliberately <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/07/19/mitt-romneys-misleading-attack-ad/\">misleading</a> advertisements and blatant distortions of basic facts.</span></p> <p><span>After the Republican nomination of Paul Ryan for vice-president, many pundits proclaimed that the candidates would finally focus on the substantive issues. Unfortunately, that never happened.</span></p> <p><span>Similarly, the re-alignment of Democratic messaging may create a choice between two coherent and substantive political philosophies. That would be a welcome change.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, the public space has already reached a saturation point for political messaging. Between individual politicians, party platforms, and super-PAC advertisements, most people have heard all of the talking points and have either memorized or rejected them.</span></p> <p><span>Hearing those talking points, however, does not necessarily equate to understanding the issues. This election cycle in particular has shown a flagrant disregard for accuracy or clarity.</span></p> <p><span>The new Democratic message may only further add to that confusion. It may copy the unfortunate style of the Republican message, which has become a shell of its original self, providing mere echoes of substantive policy discussion.</span></p> <p><span>There remains a glimmer of hope that the rhetoric of last week\u2019s convention will mark a positive turning point for the Democratic Party. It has finally regained its footing in defense of liberalism. Both parties now have an articulate defense of their respective philosophies.</span></p> <p><span>Politicians can passionately defend and debate their beliefs, like last week\u2019s convention speakers, or they can reduce them to sound bites that preclude any attempt at serious discussion. It may be unfortunately easy to predict the path that they will take.</span></p> <p><span><i>Raul Quintana \u201914, a crimson editorial writer, is a Social Studies concentrator in Leverett House.</i></span></p>"}

To most, this question seems unnecessarily pedantic. After all, everybody knows what Wikipedia is. It is the <a href=\"http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/wikipedia.org\">sixth</a> most visited website in the world and has become the starting point for all general knowledge, a fact the academic world will have to contend with in the near future.</span></p> <p><span>While Wikipedia\u2019s role in the improvement or degradation of academic knowledge is certainly worth considering, that is not the topic about the encyclopedic service that has occupied my mind of late. Rather, my train of thought has revolved around what the Wikipedia community and its quasi-tribal rule of law will allow as contributions to the \u201csum of human knowledge.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>About a month ago, online conservatives and liberals fought a turf war over the Republican vice presidential nominee, Paul Ryan. The battle was fought in the domain of Ryan\u2019s high school years, when he was, at various times, <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/08/11/paul-ryan-brown-noser/\">labeled</a> \u201cbiggest \u2018brown noser\u2019\u201d and \u201cprom king.\u201d Each sobriquet was removed, reinstated, re-removed, and so forth. At the end of the day, the conservatives won out, with \u201cprom king\u201d surviving the carnage evident on the \u201ctalk page.</span></p> <p><span>The Great Paul Ryan War of 2012 did not slow down in September, however, as competing edits <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Ryan&amp;action=history\">raised</a> the stakes to whether the nominee\u2019s RNC acceptance speech contained factual inaccuracies.\u00a0 At some point, an armistice was reached, as the white flag on the top of the page boldly declares: \u201cThis page is currently protected from editing until disputes have been resolved.\u201d The treaty does not signal the fighting\u2019s end, as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_ryan\">banner</a> also directs interested parties to \u201cdiscuss any changes on the talk page\u201d and makes sure to note that the \u201cprotection is not an endorsement of the current version\u201d (which does not mention controversy over the speech\u2019s veracity).</span></p> <p><span>At first glance, this does not seem too portentous. This election has important issues, like invisible presidents in visible chairs and acutely meditated party platforms, to grapple with. But like Twitter and, at least for President Obama, Reddit, Wikipedia has become a legitimate political battleground. Wikipedia is the first destination for any inquiring mind, and opponents have every incentive to control what a voter sees when researching a potentially contentious topic. This is similar to earned media strategies of getting favorable op-eds placed in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and <i>Washington Post</i>, although, if the bloodshed in the Paul Ryan field is any indication, much more vicious. The \u201csum of human knowledge,\u201d as it turns out, is required to take up only a limited amount of space.</span></p> <p><span>Edit wars, as\u2014according to a Wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring\">page</a> on the very topic\u2014the feuds are officially called, ensnare more than just political victims. Recently, prize-winning author Philip Roth entered the fray, when he <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2012/09/09/philip-roth-spars-with-wikipedia-via-the-new-yorker/\">petitioned</a> the keepers of his page to change the story of his inspiration for the novel \u201cThe Human Strain\u201d to one that was, well, actually true. Roth was not arguing that his piece should be interpreted a specific way but simply wanted to accurately equip human knowledge with the truth about the book\u2019s origin. Much to his dismay, his request for modification to the page was denied. His request was rejected with the following retort from the Wikipedia administrator: \u201cI understand your point that the author is the greatest authority on their own work but we require secondary sources.\u201d Roth resorted to penning an open <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2012/09/an-open-letter-to-wikipedia.html\">letter</a> about his predicament in the <i>New Yorker,</i> which ended his traumatic experience with a powerful institution\u2014an institution that somehow found itself with the legitimate authority to promulgate an inaccurate story about the goings-on of Roth\u2019s mind.</span></p> <p><span>The frightening part is that we are the ones who bestowed this authority upon Wikipedia. We entered dangerous terrain by relying on Wikipedia for information in its infant years, but refrains to beware its dubious encyclopedic values eventually led to dramatically strengthened standards. For the most part, we have ditched skepticism and now rely wholly on Wikipedia\u2019s truthfulness. Yet, just because we believe everything on the site, does not mean we should forget what it really is. Everyone may contribute, but someone controls what contributions remain. Some topics are off the table entirely.\u00a0 Apparently I missed it, but at some point, we ceded control over what we allow ourselves to know.</span></p> <p><span><i>John F.M.

His highly improvised <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dnc-2012-bill-clintons-speech-at-the-democratic-national-convention-excerpt/2012/09/05/f208865e-f7a4-11e1-8253-3f495ae70650_story.html\">delivery</a> instantaneously garnered the praise of <a href=\"http://www.postbulletin.com/news/stories/display.php?id=1507860\">pundits</a> and <a href=\"http://factcheck.org/2012/09/our-clinton-nightmare/\">fact-checkers</a> alike, as his deft command of statistics and policy specifics shone in stark contrast with the less intellectually honest <a href=\"http://factcheck.org/2012/08/ryans-vp-spin/\">performances</a> of the campaign season.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton\u2019s greatest talent, his ability to break down and explain complex issues, is sorely missing from our political discourse. When politicians are not engaging in outright dissimulation, they often spout platitudes so vague as to engender no conceivable controversy. Clinton, by contrast, broke down such issues as healthcare, employment, and student loans in detailed and comprehensible language. In the words of David <a href=\"http://www.postbulletin.com/news/stories/display.php?id=1507860\">Brooks</a>, he \u201cdevastatingly fill[ed]\u201d the \u201cpolicy vacuum\u201d left by the Romney campaign.</span></p> <p><span>In the days since Clinton\u2019s speech, Obama has received a post-convention \u201c<a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/Decoder-Wire/2012/0910/Obama-gets-convention-bounce-Should-Mitt-Romney-be-worried-video\">bounce</a>,\u201d which is likely at least partially due to Clinton\u2019s performance. Other politicians ought to take this as a sign that political success need not be the mere product of avoiding specifics sufficiently (or fabricating them) and hoping that the electorate likes you more than the other candidate. Indeed, Clinton has shown that a politician can get wonky and honest without losing the attention of the audience. Indeed, for all its statistics, Clinton\u2019s speech was nevertheless moving.</span></p> <p><span>The rest of the political world is taking notice, as well. In the days since Clinton\u2019s speech, President Obama has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/08/obama-bill-clinton_n_1867588.html\">joked</a> that Clinton ought to be appointed the \u201csecretary of explaining stuff,\u201d and even candidate Mitt Romney has <a href=\"http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2012/09/mitt-romney-bill-clinton-democratic-convention-speech-/1?csp=34news#.UE5ddXM4Nu0\">acknowledged</a> that Clinton \u201celevate[d]\u201d the DNC. Unfortunately, such statements aren\u2019t a binding promise to elevate the level of our discourse. Indeed, politicians will only react to changes in the electorate\u2019s preference. Only when voters reward intellectually honest and policy-oriented politicians at the ballot box will candidates cease the endless parade of platitudes in favor of something more substantial.</span></p> <p><span>While an avoidance of issues in favor of fluff is nothing new in politics\u2014indeed a Jefferson surrogate once accused John Adams of having a \u201chideous hermaphroditical character, which has neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman\u201d\u2014this campaign season has led some <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/06/22/policy-black-hole-mitt-romney-keeps-his-ideas-to-himself.html\">commentators</a> to label it \u201cpolicy-free.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Clinton\u2019s approach is exemplary of the kind of honesty that our discourse needs. This is not the phony moderation adopted by so many pundits who crave a veneer of credibility at the expense of factual accuracy, but rather a robust, honest, and, yes, political defense of his party\u2019s vision for America. \u00a0We just wish there could be more of it.</span></p>"}

A number of issues have been brought to the table\u2014teacher compensation, extended school days, teacher assessment\u2014but the problems over which these drawn out conflicts have occurred are indicative of a wider crisis at hand.</span></p> <p><span>America\u2019s schools are malfunctioning, the complicated and crumbling mechanisms that control them are antiquated, and without widespread and innovative school reform, the consequences could be devastating.</span></p> <p><span>The crisis in education is enormous and has far-reaching implications. 1.3 million students <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/education/dropout-nation/who-isnt-graduating-from-high-school/\">drop out</a> of school each year\u2014that\u2019s 7,200 students each school day.\u00a0 According to the National Center for Education Statistics, nearly two-thirds of fourth-graders <a href=\"http://www.readtosucceed.org/learn.htm\">who do not learn</a> how to read by the end of fourth grade will end up in jail or welfare. We are not only failing our children by hindering their ability to succeed, we are also failing to prepare the next generation to compete in an increasingly complex and global economy.</span></p> <p><span>Over the past decade, politicians have been paying more and more attention to America\u2019s decaying school system. Yet many of our leaders fail to understand the intricacies of education policy and the many factors that must be balanced in order to produce effective reforms. School is too often reduced to a simple formula: Kids go to class, read books, learn their multiplication tables, and draw hand turkeys. Teachers stand in front of classrooms, chalk diagrams on the blackboard, and serve as general guidance counselors throughout their students\u2019 learning career.</span></p> <p><span>In reality, public education is a multifaceted partnership between teachers, students, parents, and government. Schools in high-poverty areas often lack access to quality teachers, necessary resources, and the positive environment that enables other schools, usually in suburban areas, to thrive. Something in the formula is plainly broken\u2014there\u2019s a reason students in under-performing districts are not receiving the same quality of education as students in high-performing ones.</span></p> <p><span>Here is where policy comes into play. Politicians like Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney <a href=\"http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/education/report/2012/08/30/35053/romneys-paltry-education-plan/\">support reforms</a> such as vouchers that would allow students to attend any school in the state they choose, public or private. While vouchers would, in theory, accelerate school improvement by creating competition between high-performing and low-performing schools, they provide no standards of accountability and do not address any of the problems that are causing schools to fail in the first place. Romney\u2019s plan fails to offer solutions to many of the real and thorny issues that are hindering American education\u2014issues like access to federal funding, accountability, standards, and evaluations.</span></p> <p><span>This apparent lack of understanding of the forces that drive education is, frankly, dangerous. We need better and more nuanced reform. President Obama, by contrast, has voiced the kind of fresh and progressive ideas that education policy needs. Reforms like <a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/index.html\">Race to the Top</a>, which encourages discussion and innovative solutions from states and districts, have helped bring much-needed attention to the education crisis. Obama\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/record/education/\">emphasis</a> on accountability, strong federal funding, teacher improvement, and turnarounds of under-performing schools has instigated national conversation and experimentation in states and districts, resulting in turnaround schools and public charter schools. Obama has had the political courage to <a href=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2012/09/12/03election_ep.h32.html?tkn=YLPFAWZ%2FFDzYeuxOyCPJPUfvDvysCHo4oAUo&amp;cmp=clp-edweek\">address</a> difficult questions. Furthermore, the leadership, foresight, and open-mindedness he has brought to the table constitute exactly the approach we need in order to make a difference in America\u2019s schools.</span></p> <p><span>Education can no longer take a political back seat. The strength of our education system is crucial to America\u2019s future success and well-being. The process of fixing our nation\u2019s schools is undoubtedly a rocky path to travel: It will be messy, taking political casualties and creating uncertain outcomes\u2014but it is no longer an undertaking we can afford to ignore. President Obama has set an example of the kind innovation the system needs. If we can learn from our mistakes, embrace our successes, and bounce back from our failures, then perhaps we can guarantee the strong and equitable system of education America\u2019s children deserve.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s time to roll up our sleeves and prepare to get our hands dirty. Education is the most important investment we can make as a society.

Talked, written and griped over, everyone from the Dems to the Dins must have an on-record grievance about their lack of accommodation. Such a sustained groundswell of dissatisfaction\u2014the naive might have assumed\u2014would have resulted in solutions long ago. Yet, the discussion goes on. Why? Because too often our energy is wasted in pointless invective against what social provision does exist rather than spent in constructive dialogue.</span></p> <p><span>If every selective social organization disbanded itself today, nobody\u2019s social life would be improved tomorrow. Instead, for some, quite the opposite would happen. Nonetheless, it is clear that an incurably aggrieved minority would prefer that everyone have nothing than some have something. To achieve this they resort, consciously or unconsciously, to offensively reckless stereotyping. It is not right that by the mere merit of joining a final club or fraternity, our male colleagues should be harangued as racist, homophobic, sexually predatory, or worse. Their female counterparts are patronizingly depicted as clinging to the coat tails of imagined social androcentricity.</span></p> <p><span>Are final clubs anti-women or sororities anti-men? Only in so much as these are structural aspects of their nature. To accuse them so is like accusing Harvard of being anti the unintelligent. Not a writer? This paper, laudable mouthpiece for the socially dissatisfied, nonetheless probably did not invite you to any of their closed-door parties recently either, despite possessing its own private social space. Are the qualities by which one enters a selective social organization like the Hasty Pudding Club any more arbitrarily assigned or gauged than those used to enter selective organizations based on \u201ctalent\u201d such as the Signet or the Advocate? To say that all members of selective social organizations share your choice negative quality is as fallacious as saying that all Harvard students are elitists because our admission rate is 6.2 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Students that criticize their peers for networking and social advancement ignore the fact that a Harvard education is an exercise in these very activities. By striving to be selected into the exclusive ranks of Harvard ahead of many other, perhaps equally deserving people, we are all guilty of no greater or lesser a sin than those who choose to join selective social organizations. They are like expressions of the human desire to get ahead and belong. Being thwarted in that desire is unpleasant, but it is the known risk in a game to which we have already all signed up.</span></p> <p><span>It is also, in itself, an education. Life is unfair\u2014this is one the most annoying, yet useful, of parental lessons. All but the least self-aware members of selective organizations realize their inclusion in those societies as opposed to anyone else\u2019s is arbitrary. All but the least self-aware non-members should realize that their absence is similarly capricious. \u201cIf you constantly compare yourself with others,\u201d warns Ehrmann\u2019s \u201cDesiderata,\u201d \u201cyou will become vain and bitter, for always are there greater and lesser people than yourself.\u201d Regardless of what clubs we were in at Harvard, all of us are ahead of the majority of people.</span></p> <p><span>Some may think me a quisling, not being a member of any of the more controversial social organizations, but I know the twilight spaces of discomfort that our social status quo engenders well enough. At one point we all encounter the necessitated fishing for invitations, the anxiety of exclusion, and the tacit barriers between friends that our system creates. But we cannot be crabs in a bucket, clawing each other down. We should not overflow with vanity and bitterness, hypocritically attacking our peers for making difficult decisions we would probably make in their place anyway. Instead, critics of the social status quo should focus their energy on positive action and pressuring the administration, particularly on its prohibitive policies on alcohol and the languid schemes of the Office of Student Life.</span></p> <p><span>In ten years\u2019 time, whatever we do, this will matter little. In or out, the best lesson we can learn from Harvard\u2019s broken social scene is the value of the clubs of privilege to which we already all belong.</span></p> <p><span><i>Felix L. J.

Well, I\u2019ve got good news for you: neither party will exist in its current state within five years. The party dynamic that has existed uneasily since the 1980 election is not just dying, it\u2019s already been killed. That\u2019s right, the zombie apocalypse has finally come, and the walking dead hold our nation\u2019s capital.</span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>Tectonic shifts in American politics over the past 10 years have all but ensured that the current bipolar system is failing, leaving both parties hopelessly corrupted and an entire electorate disillusioned. The decrease in effectiveness of the tools from which the parties derive their powers, coupled with desperate tactics they use to stay relevant, has strained the system to its breaking point.</span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>Party dominance in fundraising is evaporating. In the Age of the Super PAC, the party is not the critical source of funding that it used to be. Under the<a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/citizens.shtml\"><span> </span><span>McCain-Feingold system of campaign finance</span></a>, a candidate can only personally receive $2,500 a year from a given donor, while the national, state, and local party can together receive $45,800 in the same year. These rules enable the party to receive an immense amount of money and therefore power. However, a candidate\u2019s affiliated Super PAC can receive an unlimited amount of money. A major donor can donate \u201ca la carte\u201d to his or her candidate of choice without limit while circumventing the party altogether. As a result, candidates require party support much less than they did before the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling.</span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>Knowing that their direct power is waning, at least one party has capitalized on the sole advantage they still hold onto: brand loyalty. Merely holding the endorsement of either the Republican or Democratic parties historically guarantees a presidential candidate 40 percent of the total vote, with elections being won or lost in the fight for the approximate fifth of so-called swing voters. Similar statistics, though obviously dependent on year and area, exist for down-ticket candidates. The Republicans have been ruthless in circling the wagons and enforcing party loyalty, casting out apostates as RINO\u2019s (Republicans in Name Only). Since the 2008 election, though,<a href=\"http://hotair.com/archives/2011/12/23/democrats-republicans-losing-ground-on-voter-affiliation/\"><span> </span><span>over 2.5 million voters</span></a> have left the two parties, while the share of unaffiliated voters has steadily grown over the years.</span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>The Republican Party in particular is ready to burst. To see the party rupturing at its seams, look no further than it\u2019s two top congressional leaders. Speaker of the House John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) represents the classical conception of the modern Republican Party, a midwestern, pragmatic country club conservative who is ultimately willing to reach across the aisle to make deals. Meanwhile, Majority Leader Eric I. Cantor (R-Va.) has been leading a successful insurrection within the party ranks, embodying a much more extreme form of conservative zealotry. Such is the wing responsible for much of the more terrifying and infuriating chapters of the 112th Congress. Tension has gotten so high that aides for the two supposed allies had to call a secret<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/72340.html\"><span> </span><span>\u201ctruce\u201d</span></a> with one another. The Party is a house divided which cannot stand for much longer<b>.</b></span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>Mitt Romney may be the Brahmin that broke the camel\u2019s back. His main selling point is that he embodies the Platonic ideal of the Republican: the business expertise, the deeply held religious ethic, the perfect hair. But the repeated fiery ascents and collapses of candidates high on demagoguery and low on plausibility\u2014in rough chronology Trump, Bachmann, Perry, Cain, Gingrich, Santorum, Gingrich\u2014has shown that there is a major wing of the party that can no longer accept this kind of perceived moderate.</span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>Such deep party divisions may lead to a full-scale schism. Try 1948, when southern Democrats angered by the strong government and racial integration policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt (Class of 1904) and Harry S. Truman seceded from the party to become the \u201cDixiecrats\u201d before being absorbed by the Republicans. Or 1912, when Teddy Roosevelt (Class of 1880) established the Bull Moose Party that broke the Republican party into \u201cprogressive\u201d and \u201cconservative\u201d wings for decades to come.</span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>If Romney loses this November, watch out for a GOP internecine war developing between now and 2016, one that might end with a Tea Party secession and moderates from both parties allying under a new moderate, something like Obama without the baggage he\u2019s accrued in his first term.</span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>Though the chance of this brewing realignment to affect the 2012 election may have passed, don\u2019t be surprised if a party with the last name like Bloomberg or Huntsman or Petraeus starts to shake up the red and blue on a map sometime in the not-too-distant future.</span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span><i>Sam N.

{"title": "The DMV Needs Romney | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>One morning back home several weeks ago, my brother and I woke up early and headed out to the attraction in Florida with the longest lines: the Department of Motor Vehicles. My brother needed to update his license picture, and made sure I was awake early enough to accompany him. Like all good Americans, we were ready and eager to deal with the government\u2019s most efficient agency, and couldn\u2019t wait to get there.</span></p> <p><span>We arrived at the DMV shortly before opening, and the line stretched around the building. The early crowd was a particularly political one: Obama t-shirts outnumbered Hawaiian beach shirts, a rare phenomenon by the beaches of South Florida. (There was also one Romney t-shirt.) Of course, it makes sense that the politicos were the early birds: only political junkies are aware of a Federal statute mandating that all departments of vehicles, motor or otherwise, begin lunch break for its employees at 10 a.m. In fact, a confusing array of federal regulations mandate that waiting time must be at least an hour and every fifth person in line must be sent to another DMV at least fifty miles away.</span></p> <p><span>After waiting the better part of an hour, my brother and I were ushered inside, only to wait in line and be told he would need a birth certificate, social security card, old license, notarized letter of recommendation, and two unique documents attesting to his current address. We were sent to a counter, where my brother provided his paperwork and life biography. The man behind the counter spent fifteen minutes inspecting the documents before informing us that we were missing a second paper authenticating our address. My brother then presented his current driver\u2019s license. This was not accepted. The man explained to us that the DMV does not recognize its own ID cards as valid forms of identification.</span></p> <p><span>I walked out and over to the car, on the off chance that a second piece of mail just happened to be laying in the glove compartment. I very much did not want to have to drive home, root through the trash, and find a crumpled envelope with coleslaw bits and mustard smears to present to the DMV. As luck would have it, I found a granola bar in the glove compartment. I did not, however, find further proof of address tied to my brother\u2019s name.</span></p> <p><span>On my way back from the car, I noticed the only man in all of Broward County wearing a Romney shirt standing ready at another counter, ready to endure his impending punishment. This gentleman was waiting for the woman behind the desk to finish her Slurpee and renew his license. Protected by her government-mandated coffee break, she simply sat there, slurping away and daring him to speak to her manager. So, of course, the Romney man was just itching to fire her. \u201cWe like to streamline businesses,\u201d I could hear him think, \u201cand you are the weakest link. Goodbye.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>I began to wonder how Romney himself would engage the staff, or the parts of the staff he kept. \u201cOh, so you have minimum wage-paying jobs? I understand what such a situation is like\u2014I\u2019m unemployed. Ha ha ha. Aren\u2019t I funny? But on a more serious note, if you work hard, you can one day get promoted to branch manager, and maybe be as successful as someone like me. On an unrelated note, I need the tags on four of my Cadillacs updated.\u201d He can really be quite a motivator when he needs to be.</span></p> <p><span>But Mitt Romney would never rely entirely on carrots if he were to run the DMV; he\u2019d use his fair share of sticks as well. Any underproductive worker would be strapped to the roof of a test car as 16-year-olds whiz around the parking lot like go-kart drivers and are granted legal permission to do the same on public roads. Not to worry for the teenagers\u2019 sake: any unpleasant bodily emissions resulting from the rides will be immediately hosed off the windshield. And Romney would not quit until he saw results. Or sold the DMV.</span></p> <p><span>I finally rejoined my brother at the counter, and after 20 more minutes of debate about the missing piece of mail, the man helping us offhandedly mentioned that emails work too. With the help of his phone, my brother pulled up an email, and we were good to go. A mere half-hour later, the process was over. Walking back to the car, we both let out a sigh of relief that the visit did not take more than one calendar day. More importantly, though, I realized how to fix the system: Appoint Mitt Romney chief executive officer of the DMV. He would get the job done.</span></p> <p><span><i>Jacob R.

I saw that acronym throughout Cairo, and it was often the only graffiti written in English. In Egypt and many other countries across the Islamic World, the state has lost, or is losing, its legitimacy. A.C.A.B. symbolizes a burgeoning phenomenon that could be referred to as a \u201cprotest culture.\u201d I would suggest that Islamism is only the weaker expression of a broader anger against power in its domestic and foreign forms.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEchoes of\u00a0\u201979?\u201d asked a friend, referring to Iran\u2019s 1979 Revolution. The short answer is a simple \u201cno.\u201d Most longer answers to this question emphasize the significant religious, social, and political distinctions between Iran and the Arab world. While acknowledging the validity of those distinctions, I would suggest that the aspirations and structure of Egypt\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood of today strongly resemble those of Iran\u2019s Islamic revolutionaries of \u201979. That\u2019s the bad news. The good news is that massive global economic and political developments of the last thirty years render those aspirations suicidal.</span></p> <p><span>When it comes to the United States and much of the Arab world, the simple truth is that we need each other. Much has been made of the implications of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi\u2019s trips to <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0711/Egypt-s-President-Morsi-leaves-for-Saudi-on-1st-foreign-trip\">Saudi Arabia</a> and <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444230504577617271550304082.html\">China</a>. However, for now at least, the Arab world still needs economic aid from the West in the form of annual military funds, myriad economic programs, and support within the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. As demographic, monetary, and institutional challenges multiply, the Arab world needs Western support more than ever. As most states in the region shift in unpredictable ways, America needs Arab allies more than ever. This mutual need demands a relationship based on respect.</span></p> <p><span>America can begin to rebuild that respect by holding responsible those implicated in last week\u2019s actions. America must uphold the international principle of the sanctity of foreign embassies and consulates. When Saudi Arabia\u2019s embassy in Egypt suffered a series of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-recalls-envoy-to-egypt.html\">protests in April</a>, Saudi Arabia closed its embassy and recalled its envoy back to Riyadh. This move precipitated earnest Egyptian apologies and the President\u2019s trip to Saudi Arabia immediately following his election. Today, relations between the two countries are very strong.</span></p> <p><span>A nearly constant complaint one hears as an American in the Arab world is that America selectively chooses when to uphold its values. These events, which are fundamentally about the scope of individual liberty, are an opportunity to be consistent. Rather than emphasizing that \u201cThere is never any justification for violence of this kind,\u201d as Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/09/12/mitt%E2%80%99s_shameful_libya_statement/\">did</a>, or trying to score political points like <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-leadership/post/behind-mitt-romneys-libya-statement/2012/09/13/b642160a-fdd8-11e1-b153-218509a954e1_blog.html\">Mitt Romney</a>, we need to articulate why a broad definition of freedom of expression makes our society stronger.

Record store owners Nat Jaffe and Archie Stallings are the beleaguered hold-outs against media conglomerate Gibson Goode, but the fight between Goode and Brokeland Records isn\u2019t the forte of \u201cTelegraph Avenue.\u201d Rather, Nat and Archie\u2019s wives Gwen and Aviva, who work as midwives to the \u201c60/40 boho to bougie\u201d Bay Area population, show that Chabon can write complex female characters well without relying on the crutch of over-powering them. But the most admirable triumph of \u201cTelegraph Avenue\u201d is Chabon\u2019s ability to write a novel\u2014whose visceral descriptions are more akin to a movie\u2014without the exposition sounding like a raw screenplay, lending a fantastical air and a level of palpable emotional depth.</span></p> <p><span>The novel is styled as an album that is broken down into five \u201ctracks\u201d that serve as long chapters; each chapter has a different mood and focus as it skips wildly between three generations and the various exploits of these characters. Archie and Nat desperately try to keep Brokeland Records open while Archie\u2019s itinerant father Luther Stallings looms large above every action. Gwen and Aviva fight their own battle for the right to midwife. And on the youngest tier is Archie\u2019s illegitimate son Titus, who becomes friends with, and eventually the lover of, Nat\u2019s quiet son Julie\u2014lovingly described as \u201ctwenty-five minutes to gay o\u2019clock.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>At its heart, the book is styled to be a slightly dampened Tarantino flick. There\u2019s a delightful Chinese kung fu master named Irene Jew, whose martial arts expertise and ferocious temper would easily place her in one of his films. The dialogue between Luther Stallings and Chan Flowers (the slightly unscrupulous councilman) and Nat and Archie often resembles that between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta in \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d with catty references to scientific concepts and the generic category of weird trivia. Body parts are shot off, dramatic encounters with food ensue\u2014think Hans Landa\u2019s love affair with milk\u2014and most notably, State Senator Barack Obama appears to interact with Gwen at a bar in a gloriously surreal scene. However, where Chabon differs is the humanity with which he portrays Gwen and Aviva. During one of their more difficult births, Chabon writes a lovely interaction between the two women: \u201cThe defeated look was gone in an instant, smuggled off, hooded and manacled, to the internal detention facility where Aviva Roth-Jaffe sent such feelings to die.\u201d  Instead of Tarantino\u2019s unreadable femme fatales, who often exist as a sex challenge against the males, the two women are depicted as human beings who are strong and yet still human.</span></p> <p><span>One of Chabon\u2019s greatest technical strengths has always been a tendency to park each sentence in an unpredictable spot\u2014a style reminiscent of John Updike, which keeps the reader entertained when the characters are just waiting for something to happen. However, while this worked for \u201cKavalier &amp; Clay,\u201d in which the protagonists were hyped-up young adults who came up with wild comic book plot lines for a living, it seems a bit more contrived when the characters are older and world-weary. After developing Archie as a sort of desperate character who obsesses over cream cake and clenches his wife\u2019s body pillow in a vice grip, Chabon\u2019s attempt to create dynamic lines about the character\u2019s \u201cheart tipping over, falling from its shelf\u201d become overused and thus stale. In some parts, he begins to rely solely on these brief segues from the action, which leads to an absurd string of sentences in the form, \u201cHe looked as if...\u201d or \u201cIt was somewhere between...\u201d in an unrelated line of attempts to try to describe the world anew instead of more effectively fleshing out dialogue. In some parts, he even seems to be parodying this technique by including long paragraphs of block description followed by a desperately unenlightening \u201cHuh!\u201d from either Archie or Gwen.</span></p> <p><span>In this way, it appears that Chabon is trying to make a TV show like \u201cScrubs,\u201d with constant segues to absurd scenes happening in the characters\u2019 imaginations rather than a smooth, holistic narrative. When the third chapter is told solely from the view of a parrot flying over the city in sequence that Werner Herzog (who also gets several shout-outs in the book) would probably love to shoot, it becomes a bit confusing as to whether this is a movie, a TV show, an album, or what it actually is-\u2014a book.  External dialogue is substituted for weird musings that are shared 50-50 between narrator and character. The more memorable scenes present themselves in a Tarantino guns-a-blazin\u2019 way that would be best for screen, but the physical descriptions of a resplendently pregnant Gwen are best described in prose, and yet the saga of her struggles and those around her are serialized like a TV show.  Usually, these characteristics would be indicative of any well-written novel, but with all of the references to cinema and television as well as deviation in form like in the parrot scene, it approaches instead a strange twilight zone between four types of media that lends it a completely new form entirely. \u201cTelegraph Avenue\u201d is not only a movie that opens up on the jasmine trees of Berkeley and flies through conflict after conflict, but also a well-writen TV show where the audience is equally invested in all of the characters, and yet again a technically wonderous novel whose clever, quippy sentences keep  the reductionist level safe, and most importantly, an album that moves smoothly from one idea to the next before a gentle, clicking stop.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014Staff writer Christine A.

{"title": "A Silent Killing | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>This summer, from June to August, cable stations picked up stories of mass killings from across America. From rural <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/colorado-movie-theater-shooting-suspect-bought-guns-6000/story?id=16817842#.UFd0LHM4Nu0\">Colorado</a> to the doorstep of the <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2012-08-24/justice/justice_new-york-empire-state_1_police-officer-police-commissioner-shot\">Empire State Building</a>, pervasive violence left no community unscathed. Presidential candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney offered words of condolences but few proposals to rein in this violence. Neither candidate mentioned the issue in his speech at their party\u2019s convention; neither has any plans to change the status quo. In a nation with more <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/08/28/us-world-firearms-idUSL2834893820070828\">guns</a> than any other, now is the time to consider this country\u2019s most taboo political issue.</span></p> <p><span>Our nation has a history of famous shootings. Progressive leaders like Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr. were assassinated by men who held their beliefs in contempt. John F. Kennedy \u201940 wasn\u2019t the only President to be gunned down; six <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_assassination_attempts_and_plots\">occupants</a> of the Oval Office have been shot. Lee Harvey Oswald, the man who shot Kennedy, <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-4.html#purchase\">mailed</a> off a twenty-dollar bill and in returned received the weapon he used to kill his President. Rep. Gabrielle D. Giffords (D-Arizona) was severely wounded 18 months ago in a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/us/politics/09giffords.html?pagewanted=all\">shooting spree</a> that killed six and injured 13. <i> </i></span></p> <p><span>Mass shootings are not a trend unique to the summer of 2012. According to Craig R. Whitney, writing in the New York Times, 30,000 Americans <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/opinion/a-way-out-of-the-gun-madness.html\">die</a> each year from gun violence, and an additional 200,000 are injured by weapons. For every 100 Americans, there are 90 guns available for purchase on the open market. While the Second Amendment allows citizens to bear arms, the ready availability of an AR-15\u2014the civilian equivalent of the standard military assault rifle and the weapon used in the Aurora shootings\u2014goes beyond our Founders\u2019 intent. Claiming weapons like these are needed for hunting is intellectually dishonest, and claiming that they are needed for protection is even less believable.</span></p> <p><span>What we need is not a complete ban on weaponry but a discussion on the merits of gun control in a country where nobody will talk about it. The nature of an election-based political system in which third-party lobbying interests hold disproportionate influence has made this impossible. To curry his party\u2019s favor, Mitt Romney has transformed from a man who passed a <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2012/07/20/romney-once-supported-assault-weapons-ban/\">permanent</a> assault weapons ban in Massachusetts to one whose website <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/gun-rights\">claims</a> \u201che will fight the battle on all fronts to protect and promote the Second Amendment.\u201d Obama went from supporting renewal of the Clinton ban on semiautomatic weapons as a candidate to a President who in office has expanded the rights of gun carriers\u2014allowing guns on <a href=\"http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/11/passengers-can-bring-guns-on-amtrak-starting-in-december/1\">Amtrak</a> trains and in national parks. With the National Rifle Association the leading Washington lobbying organization, controlling assets worth well north of $250 million dollars, politicians are wary to bring up the issue of gun control.</span></p> <p><span>Pro-gun rights activists argue that increased carrying of weapons would have stopped killings like Aurora. They suppose that people in the theater could have shot the attacker before so many were killed. However, in a dark space with minimal visibility, who is to say a second attacker would not have caused more carnage? How many more would have been caught in the crossfire? How would people distinguish between a man trying to save them and an accomplice of the killer? The idea that Americans should carry their weapons everywhere for protection\u2014even to watch a midnight premiere of a movie\u2014instead of discussing the merits of gun control is irrational. The Associated Press <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/shooting_suspect_bought_police_ammo_720ERzVvDlGsNyyENQ21dI\">reported</a> that the weapons used in the Aurora shootings, the aforementioned assault rifle, a shotgun, a bulletproof vest, and 6,000 rounds of ammunition, required no licenses on the part of the buyer. Only the weapons required a background check, one that does not even require a waiting period for the purchase.</span></p> <p><span>I don\u2019t mean to say that there is no merit to owning a weapon, because self-protection is a serious issue and the Second Amendment is a strong part of American history. Hunting and catching game are, as Obama <a href=\"http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-07-26/news/32853037_1_gun-owners-new-gun-gun-seller\">says</a>, \u201cpart of a cherished national heritage\u201d. But the argument that pistols don\u2019t offer enough stopping power for protection, and that those without licenses should be able to purchase assault rifles, goes beyond discussing self-protection and creates issues of civilian safety. That gun manufacturers don\u2019t always check for mental competency and criminal records is a public safety risk.</span></p> <p><span>Sensationalist media reporting on some killings is not enough. The same day as the Empire State Building Massacre, 19 citizens were killed in Chicago, many of them youths. The time is now to discuss gun violence in this country. It is a discussion that isn\u2019t about the Second Amendment; it\u2019s a discussion about public safety. It is a discussion with tremendous social implications; it is a discussion we cannot push off. To stay quiet here is, quite appropriately, silent but deadly.</span></p> <p><span><i>David P.

Even the secularized American is inundated with religious ideas and imagery.</span></p> <p><span>This is also true of our two major political parties.\u00a0Republicans sometimes\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/09/05/paul-ryan-knocks-democrats-for-having-purged-platform-reference-to-god/\">attack</a> Democrats for not mentioning God\u00a0and imply a special favor He has for their own party, despite His recent predilection for sending hurricanes to their conventions. Yet the Democrats certainly use religion in their rhetoric from time to time. This week\u2019s convention was telling, as the Democrats ultimately didn\u2019t stray too far from religion\u2014at least in words. They initially voted the word \u201cGod\u201d (as well as some references to Jerusalem as the capital of Israel) out of their platform at the convention but\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/democrats-forced-to-reverse-platform-language-on-jerusalem/2012/09/05/af23a672-f79d-11e1-8398-0327ab83ab91_blog.html\">scurried</a> to put it back in after the decision generated controversy\u00a0(\u201cOops!\u201d). As always, there was prayer and the usual asking God to bless the country. Obama quoted the scripture in\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/06/160713941/transcript-president-obamas-convention-speech\">his acceptance speech</a>, and most of all he talked about one of his favorite one-word slogans, hope\u2014\u201c\u2026not blind optimism or wishful thinking, but\u00a0hope in the face of difficulty, hope in the face of uncertainty,\u00a0that dogged faith in the future which has pushed this nation\u00a0forward, even when the odds are great, even when the road is\u00a0long.\u201d By the end of his speech he was cataloguing the things about America that gave him hope\u2014homeless students excelling, factories making sacrifices for their workers, injured veterans on new artificial legs.</span></p> <p><span>Hope is, of course, one of the three theological virtues held in many kinds of Christianity.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07465b.htm\">Catholics describe it </a>as \u201cdesire of something together with the expectation of obtaining it,\u201d and this \u201csomething\u201d is salvation and God Himself. But what can be read from the translation of this virtue into a pseudo-secularized public sphere?</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the most interesting point about such slogans is that the Christian hope they knowingly or unknowingly reference is really a very long-term virtue, one that must be exercised for one\u2019s whole lifetime. In most interpretations, virtuous Christians are hopeful not about earthly things but divine ones. The virtue lies not in hoping that God will grant prosperity, health, or victory, but rather in that He is good, His teachings are sound, and through them\u2014however imperceptibly and however long from now\u2014salvation can be achieved.</span></p> <p><span>Interestingly, Obama\u2019s secularized hope is actually very similar to its religious predecessor because he emphasizes the value of the hoped-for policy rather than the result. Certainly he argued that his economic policies would be practically effective, especially those that regulated the economy:\u00a0\u201cwhen a CEO pays his autoworkers enough to\u00a0buy the cars that they build, the whole company does better\u2026when a family can no longer be tricked into\u00a0signing a mortgage they can't afford, that family is protected,\u00a0but so is the value of other people's homes, and so is the\u00a0entire economy.\u201d\u00a0But ultimately, his message was that while the results might be a long time coming, his policies were the corollary of a greater series of moral choices worth making. \u201cYes, our path is harder,\u201d he told Americans, \u201cbut it leads\u00a0to a better place\u2026[w]e keep our eyes fixed on that\u00a0distant horizon knowing that providence is with us, and that we\u00a0are surely blessed to be citizens of the greatest nation on\u00a0Earth.\u201d Since the results take longer, hope is required to make the right moral choice. Change a few words, and he might be a preacher himself.</span></p> <p><span>Mitt Romney naturally took a few jabs at this idea in\u00a0his own\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/30/transcript-mitt-romney-speech-at-rnc/\">convention speech</a>. \u201cAmericans have supported this president in good faith,\u201d he said (ignoring a few members of Congress). \u201cBut today, the time has come to turn the page.\u201d He went on to reject this kind of hope. \u201cHope and change had a powerful appeal,\u201d he reminded the voters, but surely what they were hoping for was a better economy than this. Perhaps a valid point, but of course he put aside the bigger picture that Obama has been constructing over and over again with the phrase. American voters will ultimately choose based largely on two things\u2014whether they believe in Romney\u2019s economic strategy or Obama\u2019s, and whether they accept Obama\u2019s claims about a broader definition of economic success and are willing to wait hopefully.</span></p> <p><span><i>Sarah C.

{"title": "Remembrance of Things | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>An image: two modern, striated towers, set like silhouettes against a deep, azure sky; sharp flames chalked with smoke, rending and severing the morning and its lives and inspiring the somber echo\u2014we will never forget.</span></p> <p><span>That refrain, a commitment to remembrance, extends backward well beyond 2001. In the nineteenth-century, \u201cRemember the Alamo\u201d spurred on Texan soldiers. In 1863, Lincoln famously declared of the Gettysburg dead\u2014the world \u201ccan never forget what they did here.\u201d In Britain, voices have hummed a centuries-old rhyme, to \u201cremember the fifth of November.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Strangely, then, the date of September 17, which passed on Monday, is not a day that often captures national attention. But it is a day that should. Another image: a flat, trampled, ruddy cornfield, and farther south a pure, white, wooden church (fully out of place), and then a sanguinary, sunken lane-turned-grave, and finally a triple-arched stone bridge across a winding creek.</span></p> <p><span>That is a view of the area around Sharpsburg, Maryland, on Antietam Creek, in the aftermath of the United States\u2019 single bloodiest day: September 17, 1862. This week marks its sesquicentennial, or 150-year anniversary. One hundred and fifty years ago, this week, the Union\u2019s Army of the Potomac launched a day-long, cumbersome, rolling assault that at once both failed to shatter General Robert E. Lee\u2019s scattered Army of Northern Virginia and offered enough of a victory to stave off foreign, pro-South intervention, and to allow Lincoln breathing room for his Proclamation. The battle\u2019s 23,000-plus American <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/anti/historyculture/casualties.htm\">casualties</a> have never been surpassed on any date in American history\u2014a crude and unwelcome claim to fame.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the day\u2019s tragic status, our remembrance seems to belie Lincoln\u2019s words at Gettysburg: \u201cThe world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\u201d In fact, Lincoln\u2019s words are the stuff of movies and monuments, and the sacrifices\u2019 substance, from our nation\u2019s bloodiest days, garners less acute attention. Is this lamentable? For most of us, reflexively, the answer is yes\u2014we ought to try harder. But the question begets broader ones: What value does memory of these sacrifices confer? What does it mean to \u201cnever forget\u201d? And why remember at all?</span></p> <p><span>Maybe a commitment to remember, whether for September 11 or September 17, is for the benefit of the dead. The urge to be remembered is certainly a common refrain (a driver of tombstone epitaphs and monument inscriptions), but memory\u2019s value to the departed can probably fit a less supernatural scope, too. Maybe remembrance is utterly pragmatic\u2014to fuel desire for revenge or justice. For instance, Union soldiers at Gettysburg shouted \u201cFredericksburg\u201d as they cut down Lee\u2019s last charge, evoking the memory of their own wrecking at Fredericksburg, Virginia, seven months earlier. And the post-9/11 U.S. response involved a similar impulse. \u201cJustice has been done,\u201d President Obama declared at the death of Osama Bin Laden. But that notion has little to offer a 2012 recollection of 1862.</span></p> <p><span>Even without articulating a goal for remembrance, however, we can still make two vital observations. First, remembering is not easy. In his Booker Prize-winning novel, \u201cThe Sense of an Ending,\u201d which revolves around memories, author Julian Barnes <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/15657664-the-sense-of-an-ending\">writes</a>, \u201cTime doesn\u2019t act as a fixative, rather as a solvent.\u201d As years pass, specific memories bleed together and decay. But Barnes is talking about recalling a life. Recalling a generations-old event presents a still steeper task, which demands a deep, conscious effort.\u00a0And second, historical memory is not something to be taken for granted. Not after the recollection of Antietam\u2019s war was co-opted by a \u201clost cause\u201d mythology, in turn abetted by a North too willing to forget. Not after the widespread suppression of historical truths\u2014of collective memory\u2014orchestrated by regimes in the Soviet Union, China, Nazi Germany, and elsewhere. Czech writer Milan Kundera pithily <a href=\"http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_22-9-2003_pg3_8\">described</a> the mechanical proliferation of Vladimir Lenin statues: \u201cLenin statues have sprouted up by the thousands. They grow like weeds on the ruins, like melancholy flowers of forgetting.\u201d We do not have a political regime fixed on \u201cmelancholy flowers,\u201d or a culture committed to misremembering, but we do face our own lassitude. Lincoln, in his speech, presumed a truth that needs restating: \u201cNever forget\u201d is not a platitude.</span></p> <p><span>Back to the question at hand: why remember, and how? Memory of the losses 150 years ago, or 11 years ago, or the many years between and beyond, is, at its core, about responsibility\u2014not just to a prior generation, but to ourselves and our current nation, products of the indelible past. It\u2019s about orienting the present and future in light of the past, in light of the 3,650 <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/anti/historyculture/casualties.htm\">dead</a> at Sharpsburg, Maryland, or the countless other lives destroyed or altered on days like it. The 1998 World War II movie, Saving Private Ryan, includes a scene near its end that sums up this idea with more force than any string of logic.</span></p> <p><span>A final image: a battered French town, planes growling through the afternoon sky\u2014this sky is all grey haze\u2014as Tom Hanks\u2019 Captain Miller, moments from death, gasps out four, barely audible words for Private Ryan, whom the captain and his men have died to save: \u201cEarn this. Earn it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>Brian L. Cronin, \u201915, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Mather House. </i></span></p>"}
{"title": "A Courageous Career | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The murder of a United States envoy is always a great misfortune and a significant cause for national anger. The death last week of J. Christopher Stevens, late U.S. ambassador to Libya, provoked outrage across the world and for a short time had the potential to cause a crisis for President Barack Obama. The reasoned cautiousness in the White House\u2019s response has since been overlooked as furor throughout the world continues to be directed against the now infamous amateur film \u201cThe Innocence of Muslims.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Amid the continuing coverage of anti-American riots throughout the Islamic world and beyond that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2204400/Innocence-Muslims-protests-Rioters-burn-cars-throw-rocks-U-S-military-base-Afghan-capital-anti-Islam-video.html\">show</a> little sign of subsiding, we would like for a moment again to focus on the death of Chris Stevens, an event that appears orchestrated by terrorists who took advantage of anti-American protests to stage this atrocity. Obama and many others have paid tribute to Stevens\u2019 skills and passion as a diplomat with eloquence and emotion. The first U.S. ambassador killed in over two decades also led a career that should stand as a model for idealism and success in a public service career.</span></p> <p><span>Stevens, raised in Northern California, chose to begin his post-college life (he graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1982) by serving in the Peace Corps in Morocco. While the Peace Corps remains a popular and competitive choice for young Americans, this service hardly enjoys the esteem it had in the year after its founding in 1961 under the Kennedy administration. Indeed, Stevens\u2019 later decision to seek a career in the United States Foreign Services is perhaps not as in vogue a choice as in earlier parts of the second half of the last century.</span></p> <p><span>After an interval of several years at law school and working as a trade lawyer in Washington D.C., Stevens joined the foreign service and served in countries including Israel, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia before going to Libya. His appointment as ambassador to Libya in May 2012, one of the most sensitive roles for an American diplomat to fill, marked the culmination of an ambition to succeed in international affairs and development.</span></p> <p><span>From what we know about Stevens, from what we hear from his friends, family, and all those who knew him, he was not a career diplomat of the type bent on getting ahead for the sake of power. Instead, he ended his career as he had started it with the Peace Corps: In North Africa, and with a sincere devotion to the welfare of the local population of the world\u2019s most turbulent region. The often cited characterization of Stevens as \u201ca friend to all Libyans\u201d and the reports of widespread tribute paid to Stevens in Libya only heighten the tragic irony of his ruthless killing in Benghazi.</span></p> <p><span>An early supporter of the Libyan revolution against Colonel Muamar Gaddafi, Stevens was said to be particularly fond of Benghazi and its citizens. That his career should have ended so darkly should not obscure its testimony as a symbol of patriotism and persona success, of public service and genuine care for the wider world. Now, brought so tragically into the limelight, students and all young people can look up to and seek emulate Stevens\u2019 chosen path.</span></p>"}

But when I say that one little old mayor will die...well, then everyone loses their minds.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>These are the words spoken by the iconic comic book supervillain the Joker during a pivotal scene in the film \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d The Joker soared to astronomical levels of popularity in 2008 thanks to Heath Ledger\u2019s Oscar-winning portrayal of the villain as well as the success of the film. But the Joker has more recently returned to infamy. On July 20, James Holmes, a psychologically disturbed college student, walked into a midnight screening of \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/20/us/colorado-theater-shooting/index.html\">carrying</a> four guns, a tear gas bomb, and 6,000 rounds of ammunition. According to reports, he announced to the crowd, \u201cI am the Joker,\u201d and proceeded to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2012/jul/20/denver-batman-premiere-shooting-live\">wound 59 and kill 12</a> in a brutal massacre.</span></p> <p><span>The shooting made headlines across the world. Naturally the incident became the conduit through which people expressed their opinions on American culture and society. Gun control law dominated opinion pages and debate floors as politicians scrambled to defend or attack America\u2019s generally relaxed attitude towards the proliferations of guns. Violence in American films, television shows, and video games became a hot topic of discussion when the mother of a victim <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/dark-knight-victims-mom-to-sue-aurora-theater-2012-7\">announced</a> that she was going to sue the cinema where the shootings took place.</span></p> <p><span>But the issues that came to light as a result of the tragedy are not as disturbing as the issues that did not. The shooting at the movie premiere was a prime example of how American culture revolves around \u201cshock stories\u201d which distract from real issues at hand or other newsworthy topics.</span></p> <p><span>Did you know that 82 people were <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2012-07-23/middleeast/world_meast_iraq-unrest_1_iraq-s-interior-ministry-iraq-bombs-car-bomb\">killed</a> and 180 wounded by car bombs in Iraq on the same day as the shootings? It is highly unlikely that you did. After all, who wants to hear another report about the Iraq war? This eerily ties into the Joker\u2019s analysis of how we ignore important issues because they go \u201caccording to plan\u201d and instead turn our gaze to shocking, superficial news stories.</span></p> <p><span>Many use the shootings to argue about problems in American society while completely missing the bigger picture. Twentieth Century Fox has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/20/aurora-theater-shooting-o_n_1810519.html\">started</a> a fund to cover the medical bills of victims of the shootings, which is a nice gesture to the 71 people were injured or killed in the shootout. But why is there so little discourse on the way that the appalling state of the U.S. health care system makes such a fund more necessary than it would be elsewhere? How about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/jan/10/gun-crime-us-state\">8,755</a> who die from gun violence every year who do not have funds opened for them by well-endowed movie studios?</span></p> <p><span>Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18944913\">visited</a> Aurora to express his condolences for the victims and their families. Did any high profile politicians visit Chicago, America\u2019s most dangerous city, during Memorial Day Weekend, during which there were more than 40 shooting <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5934608/chicagos-shootings-didnt-happen-in-a-movie-theater-but-its-still-the-worlds-deadliest-city\">victims</a> in 72 hours? Not a chance. Clearly, American society chooses to ignore rather than address problems if those problems occur too often. America does not care about the culture of gun violence in this country. America only cares when shootings happen during the premiere of a famous film.</span></p> <p><span>It is easy to dismiss the Joker\u2019s perspective as the deranged ramblings of a psychopathic madman. But doing so is an example of the way that American culture demonizes opinions that cut too close to the bone in order to shield itself from systemic social problems. Trying to understand what is at the root of many of American society\u2019s problems does not make one an extremist or a radical. In no way do I wish to diminish or detract from the horrifying incidents in Aurora, but the manner in which we fail to pay attention to key underlying problems in American society thanks to our obsession with sensational news stories is worrying. Media outlets are partially to blame, as they mostly focus on \u201cpopular\u201d news items in order to attract as much readership and views as possible. But they are only pandering to a terrifying aspect of American culture\u2014that if enough \u201cbad news\u201d happens, it is not worth paying attention to. Sometimes, we should start paying attention to important, underlying issues, even if they are just \u201cpart of the plan.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><i>Heather L.

Our form of government depends on the good-faith participation of both major parties. When one candidate chooses to throw an election instead of trying to win, the sanctity of our republic is diminished, the quality of our leadership is reduced, and the financial contributions of our wealthiest citizens are wasted. As political scientists can attest, the perpetual tug-of-war between pitchfork-wielding, Apocalypse-awaiting reactionaries and latte-sipping gay supremacists is one of the few things keeping us from the terrifying descent into tyranny.

Unsatisfied by merely offending the disadvantaged, he openly <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/romney-ill-never-convince-obama-voters-to-take-responsibility-for-their-lives/2012/09/17/0c1f0bcc-0104-11e2-b260-32f4a8db9b7e_blog.html\">stated</a> that he would not make any attempt to seek their votes.

One is forced to speculate that it was deliberate.</span></p> <p><span>As if the heartless plutocrat routine wasn\u2019t sufficient to cost him the election, Romney also publically disavowed any attempt to seek a resolution in the Mideast conflict, opting <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/09/mitt-romney-israel\">instead</a> to \u201ckick the ball down the field.\u201d And Monday, in effort to come across as unintelligent (despite evidence to the contrary), he <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-romney-beverly-hills-fundraiser-20120922,0,2317962.story\">stated</a> that he \u201cdo[esn\u2019t] know why [airplane windows] don\u2019t [open].\u201d</span></p> <p><span>All indications suggest that Romney\u2019s cynical attempt to lose the election is working.

{"title": "Warren and Brown Debate | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>BOSTON, Mass.\u2014U.S. Senator Scott Brown and Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren exchanged barbs over taxes, energy, and family matters in the first televised debate of their highly contested U.S. Senate race Thursday night. Yet the back-and-forth evening, which turned as much on character as policy issues, provided an introduction to the candidates that was marked as much by similarities as by differences.</span></p> <p><span>For Brown, a moderate Republican, the WBZ-TV debate was a chance to show the left-leaning Bay State his independent voting record and beliefs. He took the opportunity time and again to make clear his distance from the national Republican mainstream. Warren, the relative newcomer to the political stage, spent most of the evening challenging Brown on that record and laying out her own stances on the economy, the environment, and the Massachusetts race\u2019s role in national politics.</span></p> <p><span>The debate began with a question from the moderator, WBZ political analyst Jon Keller, about the much-discussed role of character in the race. Brown wasted no time in challenging Warren on claims she made about her ancestry while a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard. He alleged that Warren claimed Native American status to gain an advantage in the hiring process.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cProfessor Warren claimed she was a person of color, and as you can see, she is not,\u201d Brown said.</span></p> <p><span>In denying Brown\u2019s charges, Warren turned the conversation away from personal claims to Brown\u2019s own record, which she said throughout the debate had hurt the people of Massachusetts. She singled out several job-creating bills that Brown voted against, accusing the senator of holding the middle class captive in his effort to preserve tax cuts for the top one percent of earners.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI want to go to Washington to fight for jobs,\u201d Warren said, later adding,\u201cLet me say\u2014I\u2019ll make it crystal clear\u2014I will never vote to raise taxes on working families, ever\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Brown refuted Warren\u2019s claims, pointing out that the bills he struck down would have\u00a0increased taxes on the middle class\u2014something that he too pledged not to do. He said that Warren\u2019s own plan for economic growth for Massachusetts would kill 700,000 jobs nationwide.</span></p> <p><span>Discussing the environment, Brown said he is in favor of an \u201call of the above\u201d solution, harnessing wind, solar, natural gas, geothermal, and other traditional energy sources like coal and oil to stimulate the economy while reducing climate-altering greenhouse gases. Warren said the country needs to start leaving polluting forms of energy behind.</span></p> <p><span>The two candidates largely agreed on issues of foreign policy, women\u2019s health and contraception, and education. Brown worked to show that his stances, which are more liberal than those of most of his party, are in line with Massachusetts Democratic voters. He said he supports abortion rights, low-interest loans for students, and withdrawal from Afghanistan.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe bottom line here: The only way we are going to get this done is to work together in a bipartisan manner, and I\u2019m the only one in this room right now that is going to do that,\u201d Brown said, highlighting his willingness to cross the political aisle. \u201cProfessor Warren would vote with her party 100 percent of the time.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Brown and Warren both spoke favorably of President Barack Obama, who has remained very popular in Massachusetts. Brown remained conspicuously silent when Warren poked at his support for fellow Massachusetts Republican Mitt Romney.</span></p> <p><span>Warren concluded the debate by emphasizing the importance of the race nationally. \u201cThis really may be the race for the control of the U.S. Senate. So it\u2019s not just about Senator Brown\u2019s vote, it\u2019s about the votes of all of the Republicans,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>Polls have shown Brown and Warren running neck and neck in recent weeks.

{"title": "Get Over It | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Mitt Romney\u2019s ineptitude at handling matters of foreign policy became egregiously clear when <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/mitt-romney-palestinians-have-no-interest-whatsoever-in-establishing-peace/2012/09/18/5e185a12-0183-11e2-b260-32f4a8db9b7e_story.html\">disparaging remarks</a> he made about Palestinians at a fundraiser in May went viral on the web. Romney\u2019s absurd claims that \u201cthe Palestinians have no interest whatsoever in establishing peace\u201d have been <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/palestinians-condemn-romney-for-suggesting-they-aren-t-interested-in-peace-1.465566\">widely criticized</a>, not least by Palestinians themselves, who are justly incensed. Seen in a certain light, Romney\u2019s accomplishment is rather impressive; with just a couple of sentences, he\u2019s assured that, were he elected come November, America\u2019s efforts to promote peace in the Middle East over the next four years would fail.</span></p> <p><span>The specifics of Romney\u2019s blunder do not matter greatly, however. What does matter are Romney\u2019s continued attempts to <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/04/obama-rebuffs-romney-on-american-exceptionalism/\">criticize</a> President Barack Obama because he allegedly \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the same feelings about American exceptionalism that we do.\u201d Perhaps even more important are the ways Americans view and define themselves at a time when international concerns should take center stage on the national consciousness.</span></p> <p><span>Recently, a poll found that <a href=\"http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/30/despite-fights-about-its-merits-idea-of-american-exceptionalism-a-powerful-force-through-history/\">80 percent</a> of Americans believe that their country possesses \u201cunique character that makes it the greatest country in the world.\u201d Now, there is nothing bad about believing that your country is exceptional. Any citizen of any country should take pride in his or her heritage and identity. But there is a difference\u2014a subtle yet crucial one\u2014between saying, \u201cwe are great\u201d and proclaiming, \u201cwe are the greatest.\u201d The latter sentiment unnecessarily creates an \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality and, worse, creates an unfounded illusion of superiority.</span></p> <p><span>A closer examination of the facts show otherwise.\u00a0American workers are not the most <a href=\"http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=LEVEL\">productive</a> or the most <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html\">prosperous</a>, and they are certainly not the most <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2010/12/07/131884477/Study-Confirms-U-S-Falling-Behind-In-Education\">educated</a> (on that last count, they are failing miserably). For now, the U.S. economy remains the world\u2019s biggest, but that will change in <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html\">less than five years</a> as the Chinese economy overtakes it. Furthermore, as Brazil, India, and other developing countries continue to emerge as world powers in their own right, America\u2019s importance on the world stage is sure to diminish, although it will certainly remain significant.</span></p> <p><span>The extent of Romney\u2019s views on foreign policy can be found in a 2011 speech, in which he <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/raymond-haberski-jr/mitt-romney-theology-of-american-exceptionalism-_b_1674429.html\">declared</a>, \u201cAs President of the United States, I will devote myself to an American Century. And I will never, ever apologize for America.\u201d As to the first part of that statement, there\u2019s close to nothing Romney, Obama, or any other leader can do to guarantee American hegemony in the 21st century. The best the nation\u2019s leaders can do is cooperate closely with other nations to ensure that American interests are protected and furthered across the globe, recognizing the sometimes-competing interests of other states while striving to avoid conflict. As to the second part of Romney\u2019s manifesto, it is just flat-out wrong. Nations are imperfect, and they must sometimes apologize for their actions. This is what the North American Treaty Organization did in June after an <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0608/NATO-apologizes-for-civilian-deaths-in-Afghan-airstrike\">airstrike</a> by American forces killed 18 civilians in an Afghan village. To suggest that America should not apologize for anything, ever, is to turn one\u2019s back on the notion that America has any moral authority to intervene in world affairs. For with such authority comes the necessity to take responsibility for whatever consequences may result of it.</span></p> <p><span>Sadly, polls show that foreign policy is only a priority for <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/prioriti.htm\">three percent</a> of American voters. That\u2019s hardly surprising, given the fact that in Romney Republicans picked a presidential candidate with virtually no foreign policy experience, while far more qualified candidates such as Jon M. Huntsman Jr. received almost no support during the primaries. Or take four years ago. In no other developed country would someone as important as a vice-presidential <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2011/0603/Political-misquotes-The-10-most-famous-things-never-actually-said/I-can-see-Russia-from-my-house!-Sarah-Palin\">candidate quantify</a> her foreign policy credentials by claiming that her state could \u201csee Russia from land here.\u201d Yet at a time when American dominance is waning, voters should turn to someone who can skillfully represent the country abroad. Now more than ever, the next President of the United States needs foreign policy experience, or at least an open mind when approaching such issues\u2014he should not simply parrot the false truth of American superiority.</span></p> <p><span>Hopefully, the American people and their leaders will learn that greatness is not something they inherit and certainly not something they are entitled to, but something that must be earned and sustained through actions. A truly exceptional America would respect the merits of other nations\u2014it would admire its own achievements without having to compare them to those of others. A truly exceptional America would lead the world not because it is somehow destined to, but because it would be willing to recognize its own shortcomings in order to overcome them and courageous enough to apologize should the occasion call for it. A truly exceptional America, in short, would be humble. And while the polls suggest it\u2019s unlikely that America\u2019s next president will be Mitt Romney, the country seems to be swerving toward arrogance at the worst of times.</span></p> <p><span><i>Jorge A.

It does not exist to discriminate arbitrarily against a group.</span></p> <p><span>As the riots in the Middle East reached their peak last week, the French magazine Charlie Hebdo published lewd depictions of the prophet Mohammed despite numerous objections. The editors defended their decision in the name of free speech. They called it a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/19/world/europe/france-mohammed-cartoon/index.html\">satire</a> of the film and the news dominating our headlines of the demonstrations and violence that it has triggered. Stephane Charbonnier, the director of the magazine, stated explicitly that this \u201cgrotesque film,\u201d not the prophet Mohammed, was the target of the cartoons.</span></p> <p><span>Why then do the cartoons depict Mohammed naked and performing sexual acts? What is the point of these cartoons in the wake of violence and death?</span></p> <p><span>Clearly, they can exist only to insult and inflame religious tensions.

Kristof\u00a0\u201982<i> </i><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/opinion/sunday/kristof-exploiting-the-prophet.html\">wrote</a> in The New York Times about the relationship between violence and insults to Islam. It is true that other religions do not react violently to religious insults. And it is also true that many Muslims counter-protested and apologized for the recent protests.</span></p> <p><span>But it is true as well that religion may be a means as well as a motive. Within the region, religious identity is the ideal means of political exploitation, easier than ethnic identity and more effective than national identity. By manipulating religion, an extremist group transforms a cheap and amateur video into a call to arms against the West\u2019s hatred of Islam and its way of life.</span></p> <p><span>Last Friday, the Obama administration <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/21/us-consulate-libya-terrorist-attack\">defined</a> the attacks on the United States consulate in Benghazi as intentional acts of terrorism. There is strong evidence that the groups behind these attacks initiated the protests and even more evidence that they have exacerbated the conflict in pursuit of their own ends.</span></p> <p><span>We can only understand the danger of the French cartoons within this context. Any exploitable content is ideological ammunition. The right catalyst could ignite the region and mobilize an extremist group from the periphery to the center of power.</span></p> <p><span>The purpose of free speech does not just depend on its initial context. It also depends on the use of that speech in the public sphere where any group may manipulate its use.</span></p> <p><span>The Middle East remains suspended on the edge of instability and any event may tilt the balance. \u201cA revolution isn\u2019t an event, but a process,\u201d Kristof writes.

We knew before how Brown would try to sound similar to [Warren] on social issues, and how they would argue the tax questions.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Their divergent goals allowed both campaigns to claim victory, but three days after the debate, political analysts say the night belonged to Harvard Law School professor Warren.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cShe certainly has momentum,\u201d Democratic political strategist Mary Anne Marsh said after the debate.</span></p> <p><span>From the outset Brown questioned Warren\u2019s character. In response to moderator Jon Keller\u2019s first questions about character, he repeatedly asked Warren explain why she had identified herself as Native American while a professor at Harvard and Penn. Brown suggested that this labeling constituted an unfair advantage by an out-of-touch professor\u2014a narrative he returned to throughout the night.</span></p> <p><span>But the centerpiece of the his attack was Warren\u2019s involvement in a 2009 Supreme Court case where she argued on behalf of Travelers Insurance Company. That case ruled that Travelers, and the asbestos companies it represented, would settle with asbestos victims through a general fund outside of court. Brown argued that Warren had fought against victims and on behalf of corporate interests.</span></p> <p><span>Though the claims gained little traction in the debate, Domke said he doubts they will not be going away anytime soon.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe didn't have a success how they had hoped, but he has the resources to force the issue,\u201d Domke said. \u201cWhat he couldn't do in the debate or post-debate publicity, he can do in advertising.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Warren, a novice debater, had less ambitious goals for the evening, experts said. She focused on the incumbent\u2019s voting record, painting Brown as a corporate booster who has forgotten the best interest of the people of Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[Brown] came out of the gate very, very strong and went right after Elizabeth Warren, but I think she also, when she got her footing\u2014and she did it very quickly\u2014went after him as well. And I think she was very effective going after his votes,\u201d Marsh said.</span></p> <p><span>Warren spent much of the latter half of the debate emphasizing the race\u2019s national importance. She said a vote for Brown is a vote for the Republican party and its right-wing conservative leaders.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhenever she mentioned Obama that was a benefit to her. Whenever she reminded people that Scott Brown is a Republican and Republicans could take over the Senate, that hurts Scott Brown,\u201d Marsh said.</span></p> <p><span>Whether or not Democratic momentum will be enough to carry Warren through to November is less certain.

{"title": "Romney's Climate Reversal | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In 2010, at the height of his transition from failed primary candidate to Republican Party nominee, Mitt Romney released \u201cNo Apology.\u201d The book, part memoir and part policy platform, offers\u2014in light of profound skepticism on the right\u2014a moderately progressive <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/15/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-and-whether-humans-are-causing-climate/\">stance</a> on climate change. \u201cI believe that climate change is occurring,\u201d Romney wrote. \u201cI also believe that human activity is a contributing factor. I am uncertain how much of the warming, however, is attributable to man and how much is attributable to factors out of our control.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The two-year period that began with No Apology and ended with the Republican National Convention this month witnessed radical changes in Romney\u2019s position on climate change. His climate policy is marked by a crucial linguistic shift: rather than use the neutral and scientifically accurate terminology of \u201cclimate change,\u201d Romney now refers to \u201cglobal warming.\u201d This switch is not inconsequential. All too often, climate change deniers pillory climate science by mocking cold temperatures and extreme weather events as betrayals of global warming. Furthermore, Romney has gone from acknowledging the role of human activity, to downplaying it, to almost ignoring it altogether. Romney\u2019s slide into the empty rhetoric of the right\u2019s climate denial is a lamentable decline for a man who once held reasonable views on what we view as the greatest existential threat to our planet.</span></p> <p><span>Romney\u2019s shortsighted and uninformed bombast obscures the remarkable scientific consensus on climate change. A <a href=\"http://www.betterfutureproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Politicians-and-their-Professors1.pdf\">report released Tuesday</a> by the Better Future Project examines the climate views of scientists from Brigham Young University and Harvard, the two institutions from which he holds degrees. Of BYU professors who have published on climate science in peer-reviewed journals, 86% agree with the scientific consensus on climate change; a full 100% of Harvard professors do. Romney is neglecting the expertise of both of his alma maters and other universities.</span></p> <p><span>Romney\u2019s repeated shifts on climate change have not gone unnoticed. Today, tens of thousands of petition signatures, collected as a challenge to Romney to \u201carticulate his plan for addressing the most urgent issue facing humanity,\u201d <a href=\"http://act.350actionfund.org/signup/Romney_delivery/\">will be delivered</a> to his campaign headquarters in Boston. This effort, coordinated by activist William E. McKibben \u201982 and <a href=\"http://350.org/\">350.org</a>, is testimony to the issue\u2019s unparalleled salience for our generation. The relative lack of debate on climate change between President Obama and Romney betrays grassroots support for swift and decisive attempts to ameliorate its effects.</span></p> <p><span>We believe that behind Candidate Romney stands a man who still holds the reasoned views on climate change he expressed just two years ago. Romney has shifted his views to an untenable position that ignores the gravity of the climate crisis. Without any scientific evidence to support this reversal, we can only assume that Romney caved to pressure from a vocal minority that is locked in denial.</span></p> <p><span>At the RNC, Romney blithely said, \u201cPresident Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal the planet. My promise is to help you and your family.\u201d Climate change, despite his <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20127273-503544/mitt-romneys-shifting-views-on-climate-change/\">comment</a> that \u201cthey do not call it America warming, they call it global warming,\u201d is a matter of both American values and family values. Climate change determines the sort of world in which we will live our lives, in which Mitt Romney\u2019s grandchildren will live their lives, and in which the families Romney prides himself on helping will live their lives. Romney has staked his campaign\u2019s ideology on leadership and responsibility; climate change, more so than any other issue, demands those two qualities.</span></p> <p><span>That the discussion over climate change has been reduced to ill-informed sound bites is a disservice to the American public. We call on Mitt Romney to acknowledge the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change and provide the electorate with a concrete plan to tackle its effects. Addressing climate change does not spell economic or geopolitical doom for the United States; rather, it is a prime opportunity to reinvigorate the energy industry, strengthen national security, and usher in an era of technological innovation. Only through mature dialogue can we reframe the way in which this country is a leader amongst nations and a responsible steward of limited global resources.</span></p> <p><span><i>Daniel Z.

{"title": "A Triumph in Exploration | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It\u2019s been exactly ten months since the Mars Science Laboratory was launched on an Atlas V rocket from Earth, and after landing on Mars last month it is taking the first steps toward the most impressive exploratory science mission in human history. The mission has been an unqualified success so far, having accomplished every objective to date. The mission has also drawn considerably more public following than NASA is accustomed to, with even President Obama <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/08/obama-to-nasa-i-understand-there-is-a-special-mohawk-guy-working-on-the-mission/261062/\">suggesting</a> that a more interesting hairstyle, in homage to one of the NASA scientists, might boost his reelection hopes.</span></p> <p><span>A large degree of the publicity that the mission drew was due to the Rube Goldberg-esque landing device that was required. While previous Mars landers and rovers were able to land using a combination of rockets and airbags, the sheer size of the Curiosity rover made it impossible to rely solely on these techniques. The key innovation for the Mars Science Laboratory was the <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/technology/insituexploration/edl/skycrane/\">Sky Crane</a>, a flying craft from which Curiosity was suspended gently onto the surface for the last fifty meters of its descent. In retrospect, it\u2019s easy to take for granted that everything worked exactly as expected. In reality, the <a href=\"http://www.space.com/16575-mars-exploration-robot-red-planet-missions-infographic.html\">majority</a> of Martian missions have failed somewhere along the way. To successfully complete a mission of such complexity is, to date, the crowning achievement of planetary science.</span></p> <p><span>Curiosity is the <a href=\"http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/39871/1/06-1790.pdf\">largest</a> planetary lander to date, weighs roughly the same amount as a small vehicle, and has over a dozen research and science <a href=\"http://msl-scicorner.jpl.nasa.gov/Instruments/\">instruments</a>. The rover is nuclear-powered, making it the most compact nuclear-powered vehicle ever created, and could potentially last for dozens of years, far outstripping its two-year mission length. The mission is notable for its focus on biological and environmental research, focusing largely on searching for organic compounds, investigating the history of the Martian atmosphere, and looking for clues that may indicate previous life on Mars.</span></p> <p><span>It is unlikely that Curiosity will find any evidence of existing life on Mars, but she may find evidence of past life on Mars and could certainly identify building blocks necessary to support life. There\u2019s growing evidence for the existence of <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/news/mro20110804.html\">liquid water</a> on Mars, as well as organic compounds and even amino acids. Several of the instruments aboard, including the <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/instruments/spectrometers/chemin/\">Chemistry and Mineralogy instrument</a> and <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/instruments/spectrometers/chemcam/\">ChemCam</a> systems, will give the most accurate readings to date as to whether Mars could support life that we are familiar with. So far the rover has traversed over <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/multimedia/pia16153b.html\">300 meters</a> without incident (which, to my knowledge, is a record in the Greater Boston area). Last week, the first contact science mission was performed on a rock named after the late engineer <a href=\"http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/chicagotribune/obituary.aspx?pid=159550877\">Jake Matijevic</a> by the APXS, a spectrometer used to determine the chemical composition of the rock.</span></p> <p><span>To determine that life either once existed or may exist in the future on Mars would be incredibly significant in its own right. But the real significance lies in the fact that if life could exist on two planets in our own solar system, it\u2019s a much easier bet that, not only are we not alone in the universe, but that the universe is abundant with life. Analysis of the Martian atmosphere and geology will also provide valuable insights into the Earth so that we can better understand and take care of our own planet for future generations.</span></p> <p><span>There are many standing impediments to humans living freely on Mars that will remain, regardless of what Curiosity discovers. The temperature variance is immense, the atmosphere is not conducive to our biology, and, as a result, the radiation at the surface would cause an immense amount of damage. Furthermore, Mars lacks the protective magnetic field Earth has, allowing <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast31jan_1/\">solar wind</a> to continuously strip the barren planet of any atmosphere, meaning that even if we could give Mars an atmosphere, it would not be sustainable. I have no doubt that humans will someday live on Mars, but turning it into anything resembling home would be a daunting task.</span></p> <p><span>We have the great fortune at living at a tantalizingly interesting junction in history. For the past 3.8 billion years our ancestors have been confined to a single planet, and in the past 50 years, we\u2019ve begun to take our first furtive steps out into the void. Over the next century, we will continue to explore the universe around us and will one day, for the first time, call a place other than Earth home. In launching at the sunset of the space shuttle era, the Mars Science Laboratory is also symbolic of the dawn of a new age of exploration that is only just beginning. The Mars Science Laboratory will expand our knowledge of life in the universe more than any mission to date and is a key leap forward into the future.</span></p> <p><span><i>Jack M.

{"title": "The Reality and Hope | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The conventions have ended, general election season is officially in full swing, and Mitt Romney and Barack Obama have begun the charge toward November 6. As the campaign progresses toward that most important of dates, I have found myself thinking back to 2008. That campaign is what really sparked my interest in American politics. At sixteen I was dazzled by town hall meetings, debates, and the constant analysis on cable news. I was engaged and amazed by the whole new world of politics.</span></p> <p><span>But as I watch the 2012 presidential campaign unfold, I am filled with very different feelings, most notably a deep cynicism. I remain as engaged as I was four years ago, if not more so; I am often glued to CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and the Sunday morning shows. I generally avoid the cable networks\u2019 primetime coverage since it is either generally uninteresting or sickeningly slanted and aggressive. I still find the arguments made by the candidates, their surrogates, and the myriad of analysts intriguing. But overshadowing this is a massive, dark cloud of skepticism. Where did it come from?</span></p> <p><span>I doubt that there is a single answer, but it\u2019s possible that the political atmosphere of the last four years has exacerbated cynicism that I would have felt anyway. In 2008, I was idealistic about the course of the country and the practice of government. As a high school junior, I still believed that the federal government worked the way I had been taught in school: The American people democratically elect officials whose primary action is to govern on their constituents\u2019 behalf and with the country\u2019s best interest in mind. Once the campaign ended, the fact that the United States, with its well-documented history of racial discrimination and division, had finally elected a president who wasn\u2019t a middle-aged or elderly white male gave me hope (with no offense meant to middle-aged or elderly white males). Some of that excitement remains, but I doubt that I am the only one who has had much of their hope chipped away since the last presidential election.</span></p> <p><span>Since the last election, I and many other young Americans have learned the hard way that politicians, even the supposedly transformational figures who come along at time when the country seems to need them most, do not always keep each and every campaign promise. Guantanamo Bay is still open, the national unemployment rate is still above 8 percent, and a balanced budget still seems far beyond the horizon. When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is more concerned with <a href=\"http://nationaljournal.com/member/magazine/top-gop-priority-make-obama-a-one-term-president-20101023\">stymying</a> any efforts made by the opposing party and the President than he is with coming to the kind of compromise necessary for effective governance in a democratic system, faith in that system and those who lead it is lost.</span></p> <p><span>Many Americans have grown up believing that our government is of, by, and for the people at all times. But the reality is starkly different.\u00a0 In practice, our system of government is far from ideal. The interests of \u201cthe American people\u201d are too often disregarded in favor of political gamesmanship. The altered tone and events of the last four years have only made this clearer. President Obama ran a campaign based on hope for the future and change in Washington, cultivating and riding a wave of optimism into the White House. But that wave crashed into the rocks of a divided government. Difficult congressional battles over stimulus, healthcare, and the debt ceiling have made the discrepancy between expectation and reality all too real.</span></p> <p><span>I still have faith in America and its democracy. I believe that there are a number of politicians who genuinely care about the well-being of their state or district and the country as a whole. I still intend to do my civic duty by voting in November and casting my ballot in favor of the candidate who seems like the wiser choice. But I do so with a tempered sense of hope and a desire for change that far too often feels ultimately hopeless.</span></p> <p><span><i>Morgan Wilson \u201914, a Crimson editorial editor, is a history concentrator in Currier House.</i></span></p>"}

Although the image of Obama knocking back jump shots at Hemenway Gym in \u201980\u2019s style gear is still pretty awesome. </span></span></p> <p><span><span> </span></span></p> <p><span><span>While at Harvard Law School, Obama played for the Black Law Students\u2019 Association. In one of the team\u2019s scheduled games, the President was starting at center against the opposing squad from Wapole prison. Obama reportedly asked an inmate what got him to Wapole, and he received the reply, \u201cDouble murder.\u201d The President ex\u2019d his signature jump-shot-trash-talk combo. It seems that even the future leader of the free world can be shaken by an intimidating opponent. Maybe Mitt should take some notes. </span></span></p> <p><span><span> </span></span></p> <p><span><span>The President\u2019s opponents have ranged from inmates to Secretary of Education and former captain of the Harvard basketball team Arne Duncan. One aspect of Obama\u2019s game has remained the same, and that is his love for a challenge. In all his time on the basketball court, whether it be with Washington elites or other HLS students at Hemenway, the President does not like to have others take it easy on him. Lewis was told, when he himself was participating in one of Obama\u2019s pick-up games, that if anyone\u00a0 did not play hard, he was not asked to play again. </span></span></p> <p><span><span> </span></span></p> <p><span><span>Even though Obama\u2019s love of basketball has moved from Hemenway to the FBI, its intensity has stayed the same.</span></span></p>"}

Citing jobs bills, research grants, and infrastructure, Warren laid out a populist message that has become familiar in recent weeks.</span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>\u201cI will work with anyone\u2014Republican, Democrat, Libertarian, vegetarian\u2014if they will work for America\u2019s families,\u201d Warren said.</span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>But when asked to name a Republican member in Congress she would be willing to work with, Warren came up blank.

He said he was willing to back legislation that would benefit Massachusetts and the country, and not necessarily that which the Republican party supports. Brown went as far as to praise the president\u2019s handling of Afghanistan and his work on the bi-partisan STOCK Act\u2014a measure Brown co-sponsored. The Senator dodged questions about the distance he has created for himself from former Mass. Gov. Mitt Romney.</span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>As in the first debate, much of the first 30 minutes Monday were dedicated to character attacks that have predominated the race in recent weeks. Gregory pressed Brown to clarify charges he has made that Warren gained an unfair advantage while at Harvard by identifying as Native American. He also pushed the senator to better-define his claims that Warren advocated against the working voters as a corporate counsel for Travelers Insurance and LTV Steel.</span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think character is how you live your life,\u201d Warren said, later adding, \u201cI have worked hard for 30 years to make the legal system just a little bit fairer for people. I think that is a good test of character.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>Though they agreed to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and not to raise taxes on working class families, Brown and Warren disagreed on how to fix the economy and reform the country\u2019s immigration system. At times, the debate became heated as both candidates fought to address charges leveled against them. \u201cExcuse me, I'm not a student in your classroom, please let me respond,\u201d Brown said during a back and forth about three jobs bills he voted against last fall.</span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>Warren accused Brown of missing out on too many chances to help Massachusetts unemployed by generating jobs and cutting oil subsidies. Warren expressed her own support for the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Plan, which would fill the budget deficit with combined spending cuts and revenue increases. She also said she would support the President\u2019s jobs bill.</span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>Brown countered Warren\u2019s claims, saying the problem\u2019s weighing on the economy had more to do with regulations and taxes than a lack of government spending.</span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>\u201cPeople are concerned,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what\u2019s next...and as a result there are less people hiring.\u201d<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> </span></span></p> <p><span><b><span> </span></b></span></p> <p><span>The candidates diverged again when discussing the Dream Act, which would grant amnesty to certain illegal immigrants brought into the country as children.

{"title": "From the Margins, Stein Seeks to Change Policy Discourse   | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Nicholas P. Fandos", "body": "<p><span>In early August, a crowd of protesters began gathering outside the downtown Philadelphia offices of the Federal National Mortgage Association. There were about 50 protesters outside the offices by 1 p.m. lobbying peacefully for the embattled mortgage lender to drop two foreclosure cases, according to local media reports.</span></p> <p><span>By 1:30, a smaller group of protesters had tried to enter the building illegally and started a sit-in in the lobby of an adjacent bank. By 2:30, officials met with two of the protesters facing foreclosure with little success, and, by the end of the day, two of the Green Party\u2019s top organizers, 2012 presidential nominee Jill E. Stein \u201972-\u201973 and her running mate Cheri Honkala, were in jail.</span></p> <p><span>Stein and Honkala were among five arrested and charged Aug. 1 with unlawful entry and conspiracy for a sit-in. As Republican nominee Mitt Romney mulled over his looming vice-presidential pick and President Barack Obama campaigned in Ohio, the Green Party presidential candidate spent the night in jail. The game is rigged against third parties, she meant her actions to say, and it is time somebody did something about it.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEvery effort of the Obama Administration has been to prop this system up and keep it going at taxpayer expense,\u201d Stein said, by way of explaining her protest. \u201cIt\u2019s time for this game to end. It\u2019s time for the laws to be written to protect the victims and not the perpetrators. It\u2019s time for a new deal for America, and a Green New Deal is what we will deliver on taking office.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A Lexington, Mass. physician, Stein is not running to win, but to prove a set of progressive points. Her party has come a long way since Ralph Nader first pushed it onto the national stage more than a decade ago, but Stein knows that in an era of big media and bigger political parties, a poorly-funded third-party candidate with a career in medicine cannot win.</span></p> <p><span>So she attends events like the one in Philadelphia. In mid-September she spoke at Occupy Wall Street\u2019s one-year\u00a0anniversary. Late in the month she called on supporters to \u201cstorm\u201d the Commission on Presidential Debates. She tries, as the Greens always have, to provide an alternative to the two-party system, while forcing its hand.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily having someone elected to office, it\u2019s having the third party that drives an agenda forward,\u201d Stein said in an interview with The Crimson. \u201cSometimes you can win the day without winning office.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The overwhelming question surrounding the campaign, political experts say: Can Stein push her peripheral third party to the forefront of the political debate with just five weeks until November 6?</span></p> <p><span>From the Grass Up</span></p> <p><span>The Green Party has always faced an uphill battle to find widespread support. Barred from debates and forgotten by mainstream media, 2012 will be no exception. But, in the wake of the Occupy movement and the threat of government shutdown, the political climate might be right for a party that tries to loosen, if only slightly, the hold of the two-party system that dominates the national political landscape\u2014or so Stein hopes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re in a unique moment now in American history. It\u2019s a moment where I think people realize it is up to us to bring the breaking point to the tipping point,\u201d Stein said.</span></p> <p><span>Stein is unwavering in her policy proposals, which are radical in comparison to either mainstream party. The keystone of her platform is a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d that she says would create 25 million jobs while laying the foundation for a more sustainable economy and environment. Specifically, the plan calls for $700 billion in local investment offset by defense cuts and further health care reform, as well as tax increases for the country\u2019s highest earners.</span></p> <p><span>Without big donors, Stein\u2019s campaign could be described as human-scale. Though it has far-reaching ambitions, the camp is largely grassroots, relying on Twitter and alternative media to get the word out.</span></p> <p><span>Ideologically, the Stein campaign is not unlike its Green Party predecessors, and her own political story echoes that of her party.</span></p> <p><span>First organized in the 1980s, the Green Party was originally a collection of local parties united to advance of environmentalism, non-violence, social justice. With Nader, a Law School graduate, at its helm, the party became better established in the late \u201990s and early 2000s.</span></p> <p><span>Like most Greens, Stein\u2019s first involvement with the party was local. As Nader was reaching the zenith of his political career, Stein quietly began hers in 1998 in Lexington, as a citizen advocate for recycling and pollution reduction.</span></p> <p><span>Stein is a Harvard-trained physician\u2014she graduated from Harvard College in 1973 and then Harvard Medical School in 1979\u2014and she says her early involvement in politics was an outcropping of her work as a physician.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m now practicing political medicine, because it\u2019s the mother of all illnesses, and we have to fix this one to fix all the other things that ail us,\u201d Stein said.</span></p> <p><span>Early on, that meant raising awareness about toxic waste and industrial pollution, helping with local projects, and joining the group Physicians for Social Responsibility.</span></p> <p><span>In 2002, she made the leap up from local politics and decided to run for governor of Massachusetts on the Green-Rainbow ticket. Her most memorable opponent: a successful businessman and failed senatorial candidate Mitt Romney.</span></p> <p><span>Stein saw the campaign as a chance to capitalize on Nader\u2019s success nationally and unsettle the two-party balance of party in Massachusetts. Though she ultimately earned just 3.49 percent of the vote\u2014Romney won the election with 49 percent\u2014Stein used the campaign to document the exclusion the two-party system, petitioning for inclusion in debates and election finance reform.</span></p> <p><span>But more importantly, the election put Stein on the national stage. When Nader decided not to run in 2012, Stein was the heir apparent, having had several years of national media attention on programs such as NBC\u2019s \u201cToday.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Stein says her political career was as unexpected as the movements that inspire it. Her political engagement began in the height of student discontent at Harvard in the late 1960s. As an undergraduate she witnessed Vietnam protests, civil rights rallies, and the storming of University Hall. Though her interests were not always political\u2014\u201cI did not see myself as a political person at all when I was at Harvard,\u201d Stein said\u2014the experience provided the framework that would later shape her political career.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that is what independent politics are all about\u2014the social movements are usually expressions of discontent,\u201d Stein said. \u201cIn the \u201860s and the \u201870s it was about Civil Rights and the antiwar movement, and it triggered a lot of creative political thinking at the time.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Now, Stein says, it is time to capture that discontent once more.</span></p> <p><span>Fighting For Exposure</span></p> <p><span>Third parties have an important but patchworked history in American politics. According to Harvard government professors, that history is largely one of exclusion by better-established parties.</span></p> <p><span>The Greens, like the Know-Nothings or the Greenbacks, built their successes on a limited range of issues at a historically specific moment. They hoped to push the Democrats farther left, and force the party to reevaluate its platform.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTraditionally, the rationale for this is education. It\u2019s a way to get ideas out there,\u201d Harvard Kennedy School professor Alex Keyssar \u201969 said. \u201cThere are a lot of parties that have had significant regional strength or success confined to a state....And in so doing they pushed the major parties.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Green Party has had a good deal of local and even statewide success, but the jump to national politics is hard, Harvard history and literature lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy \u201993 said. Stein is currently only on the ballot in 37 states. She plans a write-in campaign in others. And though she has qualified for federal matching funds, Stein has little financial support. The Democrats, by contrast, have enough of both to ignore a relatively quiet movement like the Green Party.</span></p> <p><span>The question, professors say, is whether people are listening. If the Green Party could replicate the support it drew in the early 2000s and incorporate the highly energized but politically ambiguous Occupy movement, professors say it could make a difference.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that a lot of people think the system isn\u2019t working,\u201d Keyssar said.</span></p> <p><span>Still, a Gallup poll released Sept. 13 reporter only one percent of Americans planned to vote for a third-party candidate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s been a sea change [since 2000]. You have a much clearer and starker set of options and that\u2019s one reason the Green Party isn\u2019t going to get much traction this time around,\u201d said McCarthy, who said he has voted for the Green Party in the past.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s nobody, even Jill Stein, who thinks Jill Stein is going to be president of the United States. Given that reality, everyone who votes for Jill Stein has to realize that is a futile electoral act. It may be a noble one, but it\u2019s futile.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Nicholas p. Fandos can be reached at nicholasfandos@college.harvard.edu.</span></p>"}

Though in varying capacities and associations, from page to presidential nominee, the traditionally left-leaning University has made its mark on the largest Republican event of the election season.</span></p> <p><span>The most unified of these groups, Harvard College's Institute of Politics, has sponsored several events in Tampa this week, including a forum on politics and the media and a reception for Harvard and IOP affiliates past and present on hand for the convention. The group cancelled a scheduled page lunch because of the convention's abbreviated schedule due to Hurricane Isaac.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe IOP will hold similar events at next week's Democratic National Convention as it has in conventions past,\u201d said IOP Director C.M. \"Trey\" Grayson '94.</span></p> <p><span>The convention serves as an opportunity to both reconnect with alumni and to form new relationships with potential future speakers or fellows, according to Grayson.</span></p> <p><span>Back in Cambridge, the IOP hosted watch parties for each of the major convention speeches this week, Grayson said. It will do so again next week, capitalizing on students return to campus to jump-start political activities.</span></p> <p><span>\"It is a kick-off for us. This is where the timing with the beginning of the semester actually helps,\" Grayson said.</span></p> <p><span>In Tampa, Grayson said he hopes the IOP can help to bring together what is otherwise a very loose network. While many of the delegates and support staff have Harvard ties, they rarely connect on those grounds, which often go unnoticed.</span></p> <p><span>Stephen E. Dewey '07, a New York software engineer, co-founded the Harvard Republican Alumni Network (HRAN) during the 2008 election cycle to try to change that. The group has since ballooned to 600 members from an initial 50. Dewey stressed that it is not an advocacy group\u2014HRAN has no bank account and is not allowed to collect funds\u2014but it has become a significant networking organization for politically minded Republicans, sponsoring social events and publishing a monthly newsletter with job listings and organization news.</span></p> <p><span>The RNC in Tampa provided the interest group, whose members are scattered across the country, an opportunity to gather under one roof. Of the 22 HRAN members in Tampa this week, Dewey said 12 met for a dinner Monday.</span></p> <p><span>\"We primarily exist to serve the alumni,\" Dewey said. \"We're happy to help a campaign if it's running. Our goal is not to push any particular activity, but to help the alumni in whatever they choose to do.\"</span></p> <p><span>In many cases that means connecting alumni running for office with an interested audience of fellow alums. When Ted Cruz, a Harvard Law School alumnus, declared his candidacy for U.S. Senate in Texas, HRAN organized a conference call for members interested in talking with Cruz. Though no money changed hands, Dewey said the call was a win-win. Interested members had unusual access to a high-profile candidate, and the candidate made his case to a receptive, well-connected audience.</span></p> <p><span>For Republicans still in school, the convention was an opportunity to see political theater up close and rub-shoulders with party leaders. Grayson, who left the convention prematurely Tuesday afternoon to return to Cambridge for freshmen advising, said the timing of this year's party conventions and its conflict with the start of school probably stifled student involvement.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Grayson said he estimates 10 or so current students and recent graduates are at the convention. Grayson said he expects even more students at next week's Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. The Democrats typically draw a larger crowd than their Republican counterparts, necessitating more pages, aides, and interns, which are roles commonly filled by students.</span></p> <p><span>Katerina Glyptis '14, an IOP Director's intern for the RNC's Committee on Arrangements, is one of those students. She has been in Florida most of the summer in preparation for what Hurricane Isaac whittled down to three speech-filled days. Glyptis spent most of the summer working with the committee's production department, securing credentials, transportation, and hotel rooms for the convention's production staff, in addition to conducting some political research on the side, all in an effort to make the party's biggest showcase look effortless.</span></p> <p><span>Watching the once-empty Tampa Bay Times Forum, home of the National Hockey League's Tampa Bay Lightning, transformed into a large television studio, Glyptis said she has been amazed by the amount of work put in long before the delegates and TV cameras show up.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm going to make a point to be out there when I want to be out there,\" Glyptis said. \"It's exciting to see the back of it, but a large portion is standing out there and seeing the completion after weeks of preparation.\"</span></p> <p><span>Though the summer was not as political as she expected, Glyptis, who identified herself as a Republican, said it was an amazing experience.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's something that only happens only once every four years, so I knew I wouldn't have another chance to do something like this while I'm in college,\" she said.</span></p> <p><span><span>\u2014Staff writer Nicholas P.

{"title": "For Us or His Donors? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>President Obama, Congressional leaders, and over one million people have called for an end to fossil fuel subsidies. However, Massachusetts junior Senator <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/07/11/514825/scott-brown-oil-companies-dont-get-subsidies/\">Scott Brown was caught on camera</a> in early July declaring that \u201coil companies do not get subsidies.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>What\u2019s going on? A simple linguistic trick\u2014the word \u201csubsidies\u201d can refer to direct grants alone. Using this definition, Senator Brown is partially correct\u2014most federal support to oil companies is written into the tax code (though <a href=\"http://www.sanders.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/EPW_Act_Section_by_Section.pdf\">some fossil fuel projects receive direct grants through R&amp;D or transportation funds</a>). But this is a pointless distinction\u2014whether one calls them \u201csubsidies\u201d or \u201ctax policy\u201d, the United States government still <a href=\"http://www.350.org/sites/all/files/one_pager_fossil_fuel_subsidy_bill.pdf\">spends $11 billion each year </a>on tax exemptions and other special financing for oil, gas, and coal (the \u201cfossil fuel\u201d energy sources which cause global warming). The revenue foregone by exempting fossil fuel companies from their fair share of taxes has to be made up somewhere\u2014ultimately, the citizen taxpayer foots the bill.</span></p> <p><span>Federal support of an industry through tax breaks can make sense when assisting the industry advances the public good. However, it is unclear how American lives are bettered by fossil fuel tax exemptions.</span></p> <p><span>Fossil fuel tax giveaway policy is a clear economic loss for consumers. In 2009, economists Stephen P. Brown and Maura Allaire published <a href=\"http://rff.org/RFF/Documents/RFF-IB-09-10.pdf\">a study</a> detailing the economic impacts of removing $5.5 billion of the fossil fuel subsidies written into the tax code. They show that the policy decreases energy prices between $2.29 and $6.60 per person each year\u2014but the average taxpayer dishes out $16.13 for this price reduction.\u00a0In other words, we pay a dollar and only get back 40 cents. Thus, these favoritist tax policies burden the average American consumer with an extra expense rather than providing any relief.</span></p> <p><span>Since the policy is an economic burden to his constituents, Senator Brown must have other motivations for voting to extend fossil fuel tax loopholes. His support can\u2019t arise from concern about his constituents\u2019 health and lives\u2014dangerous fossil fuel pollution leads to high rates of asthma and cancer in local communities, while American lives have already been lost to extreme natural disasters like wildfires, hurricanes and drought exacerbated by climate change. The Senator\u2019s support for fossil fuel tax giveaways can\u2019t be an effort to create jobs and boost the economy out of the recession\u2014economists at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst have found that <a href=\"http://www.peri.umass.edu/green_recovery/\">investments in fossil fuel energy create far fewer jobs</a> than equal investments in safe renewable energy, energy efficiency, or mass transit. Senator Brown\u2019s votes to keep up the status quo of federal energy subsidies\u2014with <a href=\"http://www.eli.org/pdf/energy_subsidies_black_not_green.pdf\">dirty energy sources receiving more than twice as much support as the job-creating safe energy options</a>\u2014are thus votes to keep unemployment high. The Allaire and Brown study found that fossil fuel subsidies have only a \u201cslight\u201d effect on national security. Any positive effects on national security are probably offset by the negative national security effects of <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/04/25/the_new_geopolitics_of_food\">increasing political instability </a>from rising food prices due to global warming-induced droughts and natural disasters, a threat so worrisome that <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=us-military-forges-ahead-with-plans-to-combat-climate-change\">the Defense Department considers it\u00a0 a \u201cprominent military vulnerability.\u201d</a></span></p> <p><span>From every angle, the policy is a waste of money\u2014so why does Senator Brown continue keep voting to hand out his constituents\u2019 tax dollars to fossil fuel corporations? For nearly half a year now, students from across Massachusetts, myself included, have been attempting to find out. Staff from Senator Brown\u2019s Boston office say that they don\u2019t know the reasoning behind the Senator\u2019s votes. His Washington D.C. office has not responded to us or to the many inquiries sent by the Boston staff on our behalf. The Senator\u2019s impenetrable silence leaves us to search for justification outside the earnest assumption that our elected representatives only strive to act in the public interest.</span></p> <p><span>We don\u2019t have to search far. In return for Senator Brown\u2019s generous gift of our tax dollars, the fossil fuel industry fills his campaign coffers. In the past two<i> </i>years, <a href=\"http://dirtyenergymoney.com/view.php?searchvalue=scott+brown&amp;com=&amp;can=&amp;zip=&amp;search=1&amp;type=search#view=connections\">Senator Brown has received $319,460 directly from the fossil fuel industry</a>, five times as much money as Senator Kerry has taken from fossil fuel companies in the past<i> </i>13<i> </i>years. \u00a0Senator Brown\u2019s voting record clearly indicates the value of the fossil fuel industry\u2019s investment\u2014votes to <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2011/06/15/246013/mbta-bans-ad-on-scott-browns-vote-to-gut-clean-air-act/\">gut the Clean Air Act </a>and release industrial toxins into our communities, votes to <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/111-2010/s184\">prevent action on global warming</a>, and, of course,<a href=\"http://dirtyenergymoney.com/view.php?searchvalue=scott+brown&amp;com=&amp;can=&amp;zip=&amp;search=1&amp;type=search#view=voterecord\"> repeated votes to give our money to the fossil fuel companies who finance his campaigns</a>. Clearly, the deadly energy industry doesn\u2019t just destroy our health and communities\u2014they\u2019ve destroyed Senator Brown\u2019s independence as well.</span></p> <p><span>If \u201che\u2019s for us\u201d, as Senator Brown\u2019s campaign slogan claims, why doesn\u2019t he act for us rather than his donors?</span></p> <p><span><i>Alli J.

{"title": "The Death of Data | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In the midst of convention season, it has become clear that both parties live in a world that none of us can truly recognize. Columnist James Fallows, a former Crimson editor, claims we live in the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/08/paul-ryan-and-the-post-truth-convention-speech/261775/\">post-truth</a>\u201d age of politics.</span></p> <p><span>While upsetting, it is entirely unsurprising that super PACs blatantly disregarded the facts, since their favored candidates can deny any involvement. Yet the parties and even the presidential and vice-presidential candidates themselves have started to publically lie without regard to our political discourse or society as a whole.</span></p> <p><span>Granted, politicians\u2019 distortion of reality is not a new trend. But the de-regulation of campaign finance, escalation of hyper-partisanship, and insatiable public appetite for inflammatory rhetoric have all contributed to an unprecedented disregard for the truth.</span></p> <p><span>Besides honesty and integrity, the irrelevance of truth has particularly severe implications for public policy debates.</span></p> <p><span>Most statistics professors and frustrated Statistics 104 students will tell you that the interpretation of statistical data is an inherently subjective science. Transformations and reinterpretations can create different results from the same data set.</span></p> <p><span>Statistics thus becomes easy to twist in accordance with individual beliefs. Rather than deriving public policy from numerical facts, we have started to derive public policy from pre-existing ideological arguments.</span></p> <p><span>The proliferation of think tanks, policy organizations, and other quantitative-heavy institutions has given rise to a torrent of new research beholden to a specific ideology. Data simply adhere to an existing political narrative rather than providing objective evaluations.</span></p> <p><span>As a result, hyper-partisanship has flourished at the cost of substantive policy debate. We now have partisan conceptions of reality that differ on their most fundamental assertions about the world.</span></p> <p><span>For example, Representative Paul Ryan has recently declared that Barack Obama has doubled the size of government. In reality, no reliable <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/10/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-barack-obama-has-doubled-size-government/\">data metric</a> shows a doubling of government under President Obama, or even an increase of more than 10 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Debate, the basis of American governance, can only occur through fundamental agreements about political realities. To substantively debate healthcare, for example, legislators must agree that there is a need for healthcare. However, all of our recent political debates, from the debt ceiling to healthcare reform, have shown two parties so removed from each other that they do not even appear to be debating the same issues.</span></p> <p><span>In theory, policy differences result from differing beliefs on how the government should address a particular issue. It results from a difference of interpretation rather than a difference of construction. Statistics frame these debates by providing the foundation through which legislators can discuss potential solutions.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, data are no longer neutral. Even impartial offices like the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office have come under fire for these underlying tendencies. Academia, one of the few institutions with a mission that explicitly pursues objective truth, constantly faces criticisms of liberal bias.</span></p> <p><span>These destructive accusations have undermined the credibility of statistics as a tool for public policy. Actual policy implications become lost amidst inflammatory rhetoric and misinformation. The entire purpose of these organizations disappears, and data no longer aid debate.</span></p> <p><span>We have entered the age of post-modernity in American politics. Established truths no longer appear relevant. In the face of new evidence, we plug our ears and start shouting accusations in order to drown out the cognitive dissonance.</span></p> <p><span>In this way, we have entered a world of multiple political realities, fortified by the politicization of statistics. To refocus the political debate and create a functioning government, we must re-align these realities and, in doing so, understand the credibility of contrary data.</span></p> <p><span><i>Raul P.

{"title": "Republicans Refusing Medicaid | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I drove my mother to Midwest Eye Centers three times last July. Three months earlier, she suffered from partial posterior vitreous detachment. This isn\u2019t life-threatening, but it requires regular screenings to avoid serious nerve breakage that would require costly surgery. Medicaid notified her on the first of July that this would be last month she was eligible for insurance, because of cuts to the Illinois healthcare budget. We made sure to take advantage of her coverage that month. I was afraid.</span></p> <p><span><span>We\u2019ve got a problem with healthcare. This is not just a problem for my mom, but for your moms too, and for your professor, and for the homeless men in Harvard Square. There are 49 million uninsured people in this country, and </span><a href=\"http://facts.kff.org/chart.aspx?ch=482\"><span>25 percent</span></a><span> of them are parents.</span><span> </span><span>The average premium for a family is </span><a href=\"http://ehbs.kff.org/pdf/8226.pdf\"><span>$15,073</span></a><span> </span><span>a year and rising. Some people, yes, even children with cancer, used to be denied coverage just a few years ago.</span></span></p> <p><span><span>But beginning in 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was passed, many of these uninsured people began seeing expanded coverage. Three million previously-uninsured Americans under age 26 now have coverage, as well as thousands of children with pre-existing conditions. Beginning in 2014, no one can be denied coverage due to health problems. Other new benefits include free preventative services like vaccinations, check-ups for children, and blood pressure and cholesterol tests for people with insurance. </span></span></p> <p><span><span>Perhaps most importantly, the ACA can </span><a href=\"http://www.medicaid.gov/AffordableCareAct/Provisions/Downloads/MedicaidEligibilityFinalRule_Regulatory-Impact-Analysis.pdf\"><span>expand coverage to 24 million Americans</span></a><span> in 2014 through Medicaid expansion.</span><span> </span><span>This expansion will be covered by federal dollars until 2020, when the states will have to contribute 10 percent of the costs. However, several Republican governors have promised to reject federal dollars to expand their Medicaid programs. If only their constituents knew that their leaders were sacrificing their health to protect their political reputations, a few of these bleeding red states might turn blue.</span></span></p> <p><span><span>Medicaid is a state-run program and each state has different eligibility rules. In Texas, working parents must make below </span><a href=\"http://facesofmedicaid.kff.org/~/media/Images/KFF%20Faces%20of%20Medicaid/CalebGarcia1.gif\"><span>26 percent</span></a><span> of the Federal poverty level </span><a href=\"http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/12poverty.shtml/\"><span>($23,050 for a family of four</span></a><span>) to qualify for Medicaid. Even a single mother with three children who works as a waitress and makes $15,000 a year is not eligible. In Texas and 26 other states, mostly Republican voting, childless adults </span><a href=\"http://www.statehealthfacts.org/comparetable.jsp?ind=749&amp;cat=4\"><span>cannot receive</span></a><span> Medicaid at all. </span></span></p> <p><span><span>Other states, like Governor Romney\u2019s home state of Massachusetts, offer Medicaid for adults earning up to 133 percent of the poverty level. As it happens, </span><a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/141632/texas-maintains-highest-number-uninsured-mass-lowest.aspx\"><span>Massachusetts has the lowest uninsured rate in the country.</span></a><span> The ACA makes every state like Massachusetts: Citizens earning less than 133 percent of the poverty line will qualify for Medicaid. (However, 23 million illegal immigrants will still not be eligible.)</span></span></p> <p><span><span>To pay for this expansion of Medicaid, the Federal Government will pay 100 percent of the costs to expand care until 2019, when it will pay 90 percent. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that this expansion will cost </span><a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/03-13-Coverage%20Estimates.pdf\"><span>$930 billion over the next 10 years</span></a><span>. Some states that will benefit the most from this changed rule are Alabama, Nebraska, South Carolina, and Mississippi.</span></span></p> <p><span><span>Ironically, all of these states </span><a href=\"http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8332.pdf\"><span>sued</span></a><span> to defeat the act.</span></span></p> <p><span><span>As a result of the June Supreme Court ruling, these states have the right to accept or reject funds to expand Medicaid. Already, governors in Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana have vowed to refuse them.</span></span></p> <p><span><span>Their reasoning? Money. These states\u2019 governors whistled the same old tired tune: that Obama is spending at the wrong time. What they fail to realize is that the expansion only accounts for </span><a href=\"http://texaswellandhealthy.org/tag/health-care-cost-containment/\"><span>2 percent of the federal budget, and only 3 percent of the health budget.</span></a><span> (On the other hand, </span><a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=1258\"><span>20 percent</span></a><span> of the budget goes to defense spending.)</span></span></p> <p><span><span>In fact, the ACA has measures in place to actually reduce the deficit, lower health care costs, and improve the economy. In 2014, the so-called \u201chealth care exchanges\u201d will open. The exchanges are regulated, online mini-malls that allow customers to compare insurance plans easily. This transparency will increase competition and lower premiums. Customers between 133-400 percent of the poverty line can even obtain tax credits to help pay these premiums. Benefits of the ACA, including administrative savings, a sharp reduction in unpaid hospital bills, and increased taxes on drug companies and individuals making more than $250,000, are actually predicted to lower the federal deficit by </span><a href=\"http://texaswellandhealthy.org/tag/health-care-cost-containment/\"><span>$124 billion over the next 10 years.</span></a></span></p> <p><span><span>The Affordable Care Act is effective, and the federal money for Medicaid expansion is too good to refuse. Republicans know this, but they will still be sure to call the law ineffective, socialistic, and economically suicidal in an attempt to convince their constituents that this antidote is poison. By doing so, these Republican politicians will stand between millions of middle-class patients and their doctors.</span></span></p> <p><span><span></span></span></p> <p><span><i>Michael F.

<a href=\"http://www.swedishwire.com/politics/9901-sweden-resumes-deportations-of-ivory-coast-immigrants-\">Sweden</a> and <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-set-to-deport-2-000-ivory-coast-asylum-seekers-1.408235\">Norway</a> set in motion their own repatriation processes for Ivorian migrants over one year ago).\u00a0 Meanwhile, Israel remains steadfast in its resolve not to repatriate immigrants from Eritrea and Sudan who arrived by way of Egypt (where refugees are <a href=\"http://972mag.com/myths-facts-and-suggestions-asylum-seekers-in-israel/33740/\">not granted asylum</a>) as they qualify for refugee status owing to the dangerous conditions in their home countries.\u00a0 To this effect, Danny Ayalon, Israel\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister, made a <a href=\"http://972mag.com/myths-facts-and-suggestions-asylum-seekers-in-israel/33740/\">statement</a> to the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, declaring that \u201cEritrea has a regime described by the entire international community as a regime that does not protect human rights, and someone returning there is at risk \u2013 including risk of death.\u201d\u00a0 Israel has no interest in deporting Africans or other groups seeking asylum; it does, however, exercise its right to repatriate illegal migrants, just like countries such as the United States and <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2008/05/07/raid-immigration-arrests.html\">Canada</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Korn writes, \u201cwe spoke to young IDF soldiers who dismissed human rights abuses against Palestinians as a forgivable consequence of a Jewish state.\u201d\u00a0 This is certainly not the attitude that I heard expressed by the Israel Defense Force soldiers with whom we spoke, all of whom were residents of Haifa, Israel\u2019s most liberal and culturally integrated city.\u00a0 In Haifa, as they explained, they had grown up and attended school alongside their Israeli-Arab friends and peers, and I found their views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to be particularly conciliatory and open-minded.</span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere, Korn implies that during our visit to Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s Holocaust memorial and museum, stories of the Holocaust were used to justify the establishment of a Jewish state.\u00a0 She points out that Yad Vashem\u2019s architecture leads visitors through a dark tunnel at the end of which there is \u201ca balcony overlooking Jerusalem\u201d representing the \u201csymbolic conclusion of the Jewish saga.\u201d\u00a0 However, I was not at all left with the impression that this architecture and the discussions of the Holocaust led by our tour guide were designed propagandistically to influence participants\u2019 views on the state of Israel.\u00a0 They were, quite simply, meant to illustrate the dramatic developments that make up the remarkable trajectory of modern Jewish history.</span></p> <p><span>In general, to my surprise, I found that discussions of political, religious, or otherwise ideologically charged topics during our trip were characterized by respectful, humble, and laissez-faire guidance at the hands of our tour guide and trip leaders.\u00a0 For example, on one particular afternoon, students participated in an activity in which our group leaders read a series of assertive statements expressing opinions regarding Jewish identity or Israeli politics.\u00a0 After each statement was read, students stood up and walked to one of four demarcated spaces depending on whether they chose to \u201cagree,\u201d \u201cstrongly agree,\u201d \u201cdisagree,\u201d or \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d with the assertion.\u00a0 The trip leaders called upon one student representative from each of the four demarcated spaces in order to explain his or her opinion on the assertive statement that had just been read.\u00a0 Our tour guide and trip leaders were careful not to express any of their own opinions during this activity so as to promote discussion and contemplation without influencing students\u2019 views.\u00a0 Similarly, when guides presented lessons on modern Israeli history, they would often make comments such as, \u201cwe must consider the other side.\u201d\u00a0 For example, at Israel\u2019s Independence Hall in Tel Aviv, a guide taught us about the history of Jewish settlement in Ottoman Palestine in the early 20th century.\u00a0 He made us aware of the fact that Zionist settlers acquired land through legal purchase, but he also pointed out the need to sympathize with local Palestinians who felt anxiety over the gradual transfer of land to individuals whom they viewed as newcomers.</span></p> <p><span>I will not deny that prior to my own participation in Birthright, I had expected the program to involve irritatingly biased and propagandistically right-wing accounts of Israeli history and politics.\u00a0 I was pleasantly surprised, however, to find that these expectations were inaccurate, and I laud Birthright Israel and our guide and group leaders for the tour\u2019s general tendency towards moderation and evenhandedness.\u00a0 I would urge members of the Harvard community to visit Israel and other destinations in the Middle East with an open mind, drawing their own conclusions about the many difficult and complicated struggles faced by the inhabitants of the region.</span></p> <p><span><i>Daniel J.

Roberts \u201976 explained that the law\u2019s most contentious provision\u2014the individual mandate that imposes a penalty on those who have not bought health insurance\u2014was constitutional under Congress\u2019s power to tax.</span></p> <p><span>The ruling\u2019s other significant implication has been the limiting of the ACA\u2019s unprecedented expansion of health care for the poor and disabled, ruling that the threat of removal of all federal funds from existing state Medicaid programs to those states that do not comply was unconstitutional.</span></p> <p><span>Several professors indicated that, apart from the potential important political ramifications of the decision in the presidential race between President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the decision will have long-ranging implications in the realm of constitutional law.</span></p> <p><span>For constitutional law professor Laurence H. Tribe \u201962, Roberts\u2019 alignment with the court\u2019s more liberal justices on the question of taxation was not as unexpected as many analysts have said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s surprising how few people seem to have noticed, Chief Justice Roberts signaled on the very first day of oral argument this March that he saw this mandate as merely a tax, a view I had also expressed in my Boston Globe editorial on April 3, 2011,\u201d Tribe wrote in an email.</span></p> <p><span>Professor Einer R. Elhauge \u201982 noted that the U.S. government had an advantage because of the multiple defenses for the overhaul, including Congress's power to tax. He noted, however, that most of the justices did not discuss the power to tax.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMost of the justices didn\u2019t express a view on that because they were so concerned with the commerce clause,\u201d Elhauge said.</span></p> <p><span>Yet other scholars were less convinced that the court's decision was a vindication of the federalism that universal healthcare represents.</span></p> <p><span>For professor Richard D. Parker, the decision confirmed his belief that the majority of the court would choose to establish limitations on the power of the commerce clause. Though Roberts ultimately sided with liberal justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, his majority decision made clear that he agreed with the four more conservative justices when it came to the federal government\u2019s power to regulate interstate commerce.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe sharp, bold break with commerce clause precedent, in the long run, will be what\u2019s most important about the five-four decision,\u201d Parker said.</span></p> <p><span>Constitutional law professor Richard H. Fallon, however, took a different view of the ruling\u2019s implications on the future of Congressional power for economic regulation.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe individual mandate is sufficiently unusual that I don\u2019t think the fact that the Supreme Court said Congress can\u2019t use it under the commerce clause has any surprising or far-reaching implications,\u201d Fallon said.</span></p> <p><span>Yet Fallon also said that the ruling could restrain federal power, namely because of the limitations set on Medicaid.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is the first time in 70 or more years that the Supreme Court has ever said that Congress violated the Constitution by trying to attach strings to federal money in the sense of telling the states that if you take our money you\u2019ve got to do exactly what we\u2019re telling you to do,\u201d Fallon said.</span></p> <p><span>Most professors expressed some degree of admiration for Roberts, whose vote for the health care overhaul was seen as crucial.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s enormously gratifying that the Chief Justice, whose views count while of course mine don\u2019t, saved the day,\u201d Tribe wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Fallon praised Roberts for stepping out of line with the rest of the conservative justices.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPeople don\u2019t like to disappoint their friends, and Roberts\u2019 lifelong friends will be overwhelmingly disappointed in what he did today,\u201d Fallon said on Thursday.  \u201cWhatever you think of Roberts as a Chief Justice, what he did was brave and I\u2019m sure he did it because he thought just what the law required.

{"title": "Supreme Court Ruling Polarizes Mass. Senate Race | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Thursday's historic ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold key clauses of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will likely serve as a rallying point for both campaigns for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts, according to political analysts.</span></p> <p><span>Analysts said the court\u2019s decision to maintain the health care law\u2019s hotly-contested individual mandate could benefit Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, as she seeks to unseat Senator Scott Brown, a Republican, in this fall\u2019s election.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think it politically helps any Democrat a little bit, including Elizabeth Warren,\" Harvard Law School professor Einer R. Elhauge said of the court's decision. \"The argument that Obamacare was unconstitutional and overreaching, I think, goes away.\"</span></p> <p><span>Analysts saw the court's ruling as a significant victory for President Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats. With it, they said, comes a much-needed increase in political capital for the nation's left\u2014capital that will likely extend to Warren, a supporter of the administration\u2019s financial reforms and close political ally of the president.</span></p> <p><span>For supporters of Senator Brown, the ruling could serve as a rallying cry in opposition to health care reform and in support of Brown.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think it's another stark contrast between Elizabeth Warren and Scott Brown,\" Democratic political consultant Mary Anne Marsh said shortly after the ruling.</span></p> <p><span>With the law two years old and freshly affirmed by the court, Marsh said Brown will struggle to deliver the unified message against reform he was able to galvanize last time around. In 2010, Brown won the open U.S. Senate seat of the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy '52-'54, one of the Senate\u2019s foremost health care reform advocates.</span></p> <p><span>\"Scott Brown ran as the 41st vote against health care in the special election last time,\" Marsh said. \"I don't think people will view that as well in 2012 as they did in 2010.\"</span></p> <p><span>Still, Republican political consultant Todd Domke said he expects Brown will give significant attention to the issue in the coming months.</span></p> <p><span>\"Brown will use it to motivate his base, especially in fundraising with out-of-state conservatives,\" Domke wrote in an email. \"[He] might be reluctant to make it a major point of attack. He doesn't want to seem too close to Romney on this issue since that would play into Warren's strategy of trying to depict him as just another Republican. But Brown realizes that he won this seat in the first place partly because of the unpopularity of Obamacare.\"</span></p> <p><span>Brown released a statement opposing the ruling shortly after it was announced Thursday. He called the bill unaffordable and unwanted legislation.</span></p> <p><span>\"The federal health care law may be constitutional, but it is wrong for jobs and the economy. In Massachusetts, we had already dealt responsibly with the problem of our uninsured,\" Brown said. \"All we got out of this massive new federal entitlement is higher taxes, cuts in Medicare, and additional debt at a time when we can least afford it.\"</span></p> <p><span>What in other states is a straightforward boon for Democrats, is complicated by Massachusetts unusual history with health care reform, analysts said. Massachusetts was the first state to enact health care reform. It did so before the federal government, and under the leadership of now-Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney. Then state-senator Brown was also in support of the reform.</span></p> <p><span>Later in the day, Brown's campaign directed its criticism at Warren.</span></p> <p><span>\"Warren's single-payer, European-style, government-owned and operated health care scheme will make Obamacare look tame by comparison,\" Brown's campaign manager Jim Barnett wrote, implying a vote for Warren would only worsen an already bad situation.</span></p> <p><span>The Warren camp lauded the court's decision in an email to supporters Thursday afternoon, calling the ruling a \"great relief.\"</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis decision ensures that millions of children, seniors, and families will continue to benefit from health care reform,\u201d Warren said. \u201cBy upholding this legislation, the Supreme Court has ensured that every American can get access to high quality, affordable health care and fair treatment from insurance companies.\"</span></p> <p><span><span>\u2014Staff writer Nicholas P.

In debating whether the bill would pass or not, professors especially contested how the justices would vote.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy prediction is that it will be five-four against the constitutionality of the mandate,\u201d said Harvard Law School professor Richard D. Parker.</span></p> <p><span>Parker predicted that Associate Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and Chief Justice John G. Roberts \u201976 would vote against the act. But other scholars, however, were less certain.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cKennedy is kind of a loose cannon,\u201d said Yale Law School professor Robert A. Burt. \u201cSometimes he's quite formalistic and sometimes there's something about a case that grabs him about human suffering.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe \u201962 said that he expected both Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts to join the more liberal judges in upholding the constitutionality of the act.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI expect the Supreme Court to uphold the Obama health care law in its entirety by a vote of 6-3 with Chief Justice Roberts writing for the majority, with a concurring opinion by Justice Kennedy, and with several very angry dissents by Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito,\u201d Tribe wrote in an email to the Crimson. \u201cNobody has a crystal ball, of course, but that\u2019s my best bet.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Burt agreed that Roberts might vote for the act, if only to write the majority and construe the court\u2019s decision in an extremely narrow sense. He added that though he expected Scalia to vote against the act, it was possible that he would draw upon his own opinion from \u201cGonzales v. Raich,\u201d where he as part of the majority ruled that the federal government has the right to ban medicinal marijuana even when overriding a state\u2019s decision to legalize it, acknowledging the power of the federal government when regulating commerce.</span></p> <p><span>Many, such as Law School professor Einer R. Elhauge \u201982, have argued that a very similar argument can be made to support the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. But both Elhauge and Burt said that this outcome was somewhat unlikely.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cScalia, in particular, made lots of statements that I would say are contrary to his opinion in the medical marijuana case,\u201d Elhauge said.</span></p> <p><span>Other points of debate included whether the entire act or just portions of it would be struck down.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think they will uphold the Medicaid limitations,\u201d said Yale Law School professor William N. Eskridge, Jr. \u201cI think there is a good chance\u2014a likely chance\u2014that they will strike down the individual mandate.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Law School professor Richard Fallon agreed that the individual mandate would be struck down, noting that the fate of the Medicaid limitations depends on the act\u2019s severability\u2014the ability of portions of a law to be enforced if other parts are found illegal or unconstitutional.</span></p> <p><span>Most professors, however, said that they personally believed the act to be constitutional. Even professors who disagreed with portions of the act, such as Yale Law School professor Peter H. Schuck, held this view.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Constitution permits government to coerce people in a variety of ways: taxes, the draft, obtaining a passport to travel,\u201d Schuck wrote in an email. In the case of a well-debated and important law, \u201cthe Court should only strike it down if the violation is very clear, not where as here invalidation would be a stretch.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Other scholars, like Parker, were less dismissive of the arguments against Obamacare. Parker said many scholars and pundits had failed to apply legal realism and forgotten that precedents can be changed. According to him, many of the justices see this case as a quickly receding opportunity.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf they let this go, I don't believe that they will see any foreseeable prospect of stopping federal expansion,\u201d Parker said.</span></p> <p><span>Though Burt more emphatically defended the constitutionality of the act, he similarly acknowledged that the final decision will be made not by scholars, but by the justices.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Constitution is what the Supreme Court says it is,\u201d Burt said. \u201cWe'll learn on Thursday if [the act] is constitutional.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Maya Jonas-Silver can be reached at mayajonas-silver@college.harvard.edu.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Petey E.

{"title": "Hoping for a Heart | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 decision to preserve the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate because it resembles a tax does more than clarify the constitutionality of health reform. It sheds light on his decision-making paradigm and offers more interesting questions concerning how he will vote on future cases. Previously, Roberts has characterized the role of a judge as one of fair and unbiased mediation, but he has nevertheless consistently voted in step with the right wing of the court. His opinion on the Affordable Care Act reveals a desire on his part to preserve the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. However, it leaves open the question of whether he may merely be attempting to set the legal groundwork for the dismemberment of future regulatory and social welfare programs.</span></p> <p><span>Roberts\u2019 vote to preserve the individual mandate reveals his keenness to dispel allegations that the Supreme Court practices partisan politics\u2014an extension of the \u2018humble\u2019 persona he has cultivated during his tenure. When speaking before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation process, Roberts characterized his role as being <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/13/AR2005091300693.html\">comparable to an umpire</a>: \u201cThe role of an umpire and a judge is critical.\u00a0They make sure everybody plays by the rules.\u201d However, he also noted that \u201cNobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire. Judges have to have the humility to recognize that they operate within a system of precedent.\u201d When he voted with the majority to limit the powers of the McCain-Feingold Campaign Reform Act, Roberts was careful to be relatively narrow in <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZC.html\">his opinion</a>, rather than making generalizing claims of the sort <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZC1.html\">made by Justice Scalia</a> about the First Amendment\u2019s protections of \u201cspeech, not speakers.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>New Yorker writer Jeffrey Toobin <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/25/090525fa_fact_toobin\">noted</a> that Roberts\u2019 record of writing opinions like these, which avoid bombastic language and speak largely in terms of precedent and narrowness of judicial power, is not evidence \u201cof a humble moderate but, rather, that of a doctrinaire conservative. The kind of humility that Roberts favors reflects a view that the Court should almost always defer to the existing power relationships in society.\u201d However, Toobin\u2019s illustration of Roberts\u2019 \u2018humility\u2019 can be expanded. Instead of speaking in terms of power relationships, which are obviously political, Roberts chooses to speak in terms of deference. In this way, he avoids the appearance of partisanship on the bench of the court. But, when Roberts wrote his opinions concerning corporate influence in elections, gun regulation, and affirmative action, he chose not to include empathy as a judicial tool of equivalent importance to humility\u2014hence his appearance as a \u201cdoctrinaire conservative.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>However, Roberts\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf\">opinion on the Affordable Care Act</a> cannot be said to be as obviously \u201cdoctrinaire\u201d as those he has written for prior cases. It doesn\u2019t easily pair up, on the surface, with the opinions of his fellow conservative justices and doesn\u2019t merely differ on details of interpretation, as his past ones have. Roberts once again wrote in terms of humility and deference, acknowledging that \u201cevery reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.\u201d Although the mandate appears to be written as \u201ca command under the Commerce Clause,\u201d Roberts notes, it can still be read as \u201cestablishing a condition\u2014not owning health insurance\u2014that triggers a tax\u201d and that since \u201cthe Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.\u201d The question remains as to why Roberts is choosing to vote this way. Is it merely to save the endangered image of the Supreme Court? Is it still subtly \u201cdoctrinaire,\u201d attempting to preserve \u201cpower relationships\u201d by decreasing Congress\u2019 power to pass regulation under the Commerce Clause?</span></p> <p><span>In a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/17/magazine/17CONSTITUTION.html\">2005 article</a>, law professor Jeffrey Rosen noted how decreasing Congress\u2019 authority to regulate under the Commerce Clause has been part of a conservative commitment to the \u201cConstitution in Exile,\u201d an effort to decrease regulation to the level that existed prior to the New Deal. Rosen cites John Roberts\u2019 behavior as a federal judge, when he questioned the regulatory power of the Endangered Species Act, as possibly evidencing his belief in the \u201cConstitution in Exile.\u201d Reporter Lyle Denniston <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/06/dont-call-it-a-mandate-its-a-tax/\">notes</a> that Roberts\u2019 language may be suggesting to Congress that, \u201cif it can muster the votes to pass new laws to improve the social welfare of America, it might be better advised to create new cultural obligations that can be enforced under the tax code.\u201d Until a future case concerning regulatory power gained under the Commerce Clause comes before the court, it may be too early to tell if decreasing such power is truly why Justice Roberts ruled the way he did,</span></p> <p><span>When Barack Obama, as a Senator from Illinois, voted against Roberts\u2019 confirmation as Chief Justice, he stated that he was confident Justice Roberts would decide \u2018correctly\u2019 on cases 95% of the time. In the other 5% of cases, <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/304297/i-will-be-voting-against-john-roberts-nomination-i-hope-i-am-wrong-daniel-foster?toggle=y\">he observed</a>, \u201cLegal process alone will not lead you to a rule of decision\u2026 the critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge\u2019s heart.\u201d I hope that Chief Justice Roberts\u2019 recent decision is evidence of his ongoing transformation from a cold and detached justice into an empathetic one, with a heart of gold. However, I\u2019m not holding my breath.</span></p> <p><span><i>Nikhil R. Mulani \u201914, a Crimson editorial writer, is a classics concentrator in Eliot House.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Giving Voters Control | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius was framed in every possible way well before the final announcement on June 28. Each political lobby had <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/06/preparing-supreme-courts-big-health-care-decision/53858/\">prepared</a> its spin and readied itself for both victorious congratulations and sulking vitriol in anticipation of the tense moments after 10 a.m.</span></p> <p><span>By the time of the decision, opposing ideological factions had congealed into well-formed parties. Conservatives would rejoice if President Obama\u2019s healthcare law was overturned and cry foul if it was deemed constitutional, while conversely, progressives would denounce a ruling of unconstitutionality as <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/06/scotus-update-la-loi-cest-moi/258900/\">illegitimate</a> and only deign to acknowledge the exalted jurisprudence of the Supreme Court if it ruled in their favor.</span></p> <p><span>In the days immediately after the ruling, these early reactions have proved na\u00efve. The decision is so complex that Fox News and CNN both initially <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/AP7fb98cdd01154a4d844b1bfc5d3270cd.html\">interpreted</a> it along the lines of \u201cSupreme Court kills individual mandate.\u201d At first, the gut responses were as expected. Conservatives have <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/06/28/brent-bozell-slams-justice-jon-roberts-as-a-traitor-to-his-philosophy\">deplored</a> Chief Justice Roberts as an ignominious turncoat. Many worry he will fall down the Souter or, God forbid, Warren rabbit hole of justices who decide to cast off their limited government garments once they don the secure black robes for life. Liberals were jubilant at the validation of their progressive hero\u2019s signature policy, and breathed a sigh of relief that what they decry as iniquitous Koch brother political interests have not yet hijacked the highest court in the land.</span></p> <p><span>Just a few days later, those id-powered responses are not so crystallized. Conservative pundits are <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-why-roberts-did-it/2012/06/28/gJQA4X0g9V_story.html\">increasingly</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/george-will-supreme-court-gives-conservatives-a-consolation-prize/2012/06/28/gJQAWyhY9V_story.html\">coming</a> to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/virginia-politics/post/ken-cuccinelli-on-second-thought-likes-supreme-court-health-care-decision/2012/06/28/gJQA2kVX9V_blog.html\">realize</a> that this is a long-term prize when it comes to strict constructionist interpretations of the Commerce Clause, as well as the Necessary and Proper Clause. Obama\u2019s Solicitor General tried to pass the mandate off on both accounts before <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/03/27/149465820/transcript-supreme-court-the-health-care-law-and-the-individual-mandate\">throwing</a> the \u201ctaxation powers\u201d argument as a Hail Mary. Progressives, while still riding high on the success of government-influenced social policy, may start to realize that implementing their agenda through taxes and the Internal Revenue Service, while being permissible in the eyes of the Founding Fathers, may be a bit harder to play among the American public.</span></p> <p><span>This is what the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling truly expresses. The Court did not want to get involved in politics or judgment of what is good for the American people. Congress very clearly maintains power to influence social policy by enacting duties on behavior that is socially undesirable. An American citizen pays higher taxes if he or she buys cigarettes and lower taxes if he or she donates to charity, has children, or owns a home. Every so often there is political uproar over the multitudinous loopholes in the tax code. Yet, missing from the argument to close those loopholes is the claim that tax credits are inherently unconstitutional.</span></p> <p><span>Assertions that the result of NFIB v. Sebelius opens the door for extreme government overreach fail to see how long ago that ship has sailed. Back in the day, there was serious judicial discourse regarding Congress\u2019s power to \u201clay and collect taxes, duties, imports, and excises.\u201d That discourse resulted in the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution, supplementing the taxation powers vested by the Constitution with the ability to collect revenue from people\u2019s incomes. Prior to 1913, government had to <a href=\"http://reason.com/archives/1999/01/01/constitutional-challenge\">finesse</a> levying of taxes by calling them excise taxes and tethering them to numerical apportionment by state. \u00a0Afterwards, Congress had near unlimited power to raise funds by legislative imposition. In fact, when the FDR administration was debating whether to frame the Social Security Act as sanctioned by the Commerce Clause or the Taxation and Spending Clause, his Committee on Economic Security <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/history/court.html\">opted</a> for the latter. This proved to be a prudent move since the Supreme Court, recognizing the extensive taxation powers that had been solidified two decades before, <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/history/tea.htm\">recognized</a> its constitutionality by a wide 7-2 margin.</span></p> <p><span>When the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was contested in court, few questioned Congress\u2019s ability to tax however it pleased. The opposition was based on the notion that any mandate is an overextension of the Commerce Clause. This reasoning turned out to be sound and\u2014in a surprising turn of events\u2014deemed so in a court decision accepted by progressives. Such an outcome was unthinkable a few days before the decision, as liberal opponents primed the result with reminders of the <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/06/yes-bush-v-gore-did-steal-the-election.html\">perceived</a> illegitimacy of Bush v. Gore and a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ej-dionne-jr-justice-scalia-should-resign/2012/06/27/gJQApkO06V_story.html\">tarnishing</a> of Antonin Scalia\u2019s legal judgment.</span></p> <p><span>In the end, the Supreme Court emerges unsullied. It extricated itself from accusations from the left. And, although the Chief Justice currently faces visceral acrimoniousness from the right, that contempt is slowly ebbing into a mixture of confusion and hopefulness. While some swear to never forgive the Bush appointee for his betrayal, others give him credit for playing the longer gambit.</span></p> <p><span>When it comes to the Court and the Constitution, little has changed. The Commerce Clause remains limited, while the taxation one subsists as practically illimitable. The Supreme Court is still largely trusted and will probably continue to proclaim conservative decrees along the lines of the <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-1179h9j3.pdf\">per curiam</a> issued overturning spending constraints in the Montana political arena.</span></p> <p><span>The Supreme Court decision does not, however, mean everything remains the same. It could have powerful implications on the two policy-oriented arms of the American government. As Chief Justice John Roberts pointedly <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf\">notes</a> in his majority opinion, justices \u201cpossess neither the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments.\u201d That power rests with Congress, whose responsibility it is to make the policy judgments, and with the executive, who has the authority to implement it.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike the judicial branch, the lawgivers in the legislative and executive branch receive this prerogative directly from voters. Democrats in Congress pushed an unpopular healthcare law through the Senate. Now they must respond to voters who have full knowledge that the mandate is indeed a tax. In a country where the legislative has infinite taxing power, the forces of democracy\u2014not the forces of a conservative Court\u2014serve as the only restraint.</span></p> <p><span><i>John F.M.

{"title": "The Illuminations of Birthright | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>This summer, I left North America for one of the first times in my life. On an El-Al jet surrounded by dozens of other Jewish college-aged students, I flew across multiple continents before landing in the Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv to embark on my \u201cbirthright\u201d: an all-expenses-paid ten-day trip across Israel.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike Crimson editorial <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/6/9/israel-travel-illuminations/\">writer</a> Samuel Doniger, my compunctions about travelling to Israel were not about the safety of public buses or the loneliness of Israel\u2019s desert terrain. Rather, I feared what I would learn on the trip: Taglit-Birthright Israel, the organization that currently <a href=\"http://www.birthrightisrael.com/site/PageServer?pagename=about_pressreleases\">sends</a> 40,000 students and young adults per year on ten-day tours of the Holy Land, is notorious for its role in influencing the political ideology of American Jews. (After all, Birthright gets much of its funding from the <a href=\"http://www.birthrightisrael.com/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=12177\">right-wing Israeli government</a> and right-wing American Jews like casino magnate and Romney supporter <a href=\"http://www.birthrightisrael.com/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=13454\">Sheldon Adelson</a>.)</span></p> <p><span>At first, I was surprised to find that my Birthright trip was less explicitly political than I had feared. Our tour guide, a young Israeli who is also a reserve officer in the Israeli Defense Forces, gave us a thorough and objective history of the Israeli border and otherwise seemed to focus on describing Israel\u2019s tourist attractions, ruggedly beautiful landscape, and Jewish culture.</span></p> <p><span>However, I soon realized that a trip around Israel aimed at fostering Jewish identity cannot avoid politics. From its name\u2014\u201cBirthright\u201d implies that all Jews have the right to the land of Israel, while ignoring the Palestinian refugees who have been prevented from returning home for decades\u2014to its itinerary\u2014which includes ventures into the disputed Golan Heights, where participants gleefully take pictures of the ruined shells of \u201cabandoned\u201d Syrian homes\u2014Birthright advances the political agenda of the Israeli and American right. The fact that it does so in an insidious way makes its messaging all the more dangerous.</span></p> <p><span>As all Birthright trips do, my group travelled to the Holocaust history museum, <a href=\"http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/museum/overview.asp\">the Yad Vashem</a>. Most of the museum is centered around a long, dark tunnel with exhibits on each side detailing the horrors inflicted on Jews in Europe. The \u201clight at the end of the tunnel,\u201d the symbolic conclusion of the Jewish saga, is a balcony overlooking Jerusalem. The tour guide at the museum asked us, \u201cWhy did God let the Holocaust happen?\u201d One American on my trip dutifully responded, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the Holocaust, there might never have been a state of Israel.\u201d The existence of a political state hardly seems to justify the extermination of over 10 million innocent people, but this was the message conveyed by the architecture of the Yad Vashem and seemed to be the narrative our tour guides desired us to understand.</span></p> <p><span>At the end of our trip, our tour guide brought us to Mount Herzl cemetery, Israel\u2019s national cemetery. At the area of the cemetery <a href=\"http://laad.btl.gov.il/show_item.asp?levelId=35164\">reserved</a> for civilian victims of acts of terror, our guide told us why it was important for us as Jews to support Israel: because \u201cArabs are different from us,\u201d and teach their children to hate in school. As members of my group supplied other examples of \u201cArabs\u201d killing innocents\u2014\u201cSyria.\u201d \u201cIran.\u201d \u201cAl-Qaeda, 9/11.\u201d\u2014we reflected on the necessity of defending Israel from the Palestinians, who, after all, have plenty of Arab brothers and sisters to support them, right?</span></p> <p><span>Throughout the rest of our tour, we spoke to young IDF soldiers who dismissed human rights abuses against Palestinians as a forgivable consequence of a Jewish state. We spoke to older Israelis who informed us that Israel was the only place in the world safe for Jews, invoking the racism that seems to run unquestioned through Jewish Israeli public discourse\u2014one told us, \u201cthere could be another Holocaust in America any time. Jesse Jackson, or another one of those black people\u2026\u201d Our trip leader supplemented these interactions with a quip about Israel\u2019s thriving biotechnology industry: \u201cIsrael doesn\u2019t have many natural resources, but we do have the Jewish mind.\u201d We posed for a picture atop an old tank, shouting, \u201cIsraeli power!\u201d And meanwhile, throughout the entire tour, we were encouraged to return to Israel, to make aliyah.</span></p> <p><span>Zionists look to Birthright Israel as a way to inspire Jewish pride among largely assimilated, ethnically Jewish college students. Even liberal Zionist Peter Beinart, when he came to speak at Harvard last semester, <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/peter-beinart-takes-aim-at-birthright-experience/\">critiqued Birthright</a> only for failing to expose participants to a Palestinian perspective (it\u2019s true: we didn\u2019t speak to a single non-Jew during a full ten days in the Middle East).</span></p> <p><span>But Birthright\u2019s idea of engaging with Israel means supporting an illegal and oppressive military occupation, claiming citizenship to a state that <a href=\"http://forward.com/articles/158472/deported-africans-face-struggle-at-home/\">deports</a> African immigrants, glorifying \u201cthe Jewish mind,\u201d and decrying all Arabs collectively for their hateful terrorist tactics. Simply introducing a Palestinian voice could not begin to correct for the fact that Birthright is firmly entrenched in right-wing rhetoric, from racism to militarism. If liberal American supporters of Israel truly hope for their children to engage with global Jewish politics in a meaningful way, they should stop sending them on a trip to Israel called \u201cBirthright\u201d and start teaching critical thinking about the role of Jews in promoting justice around the world.</span></p> <p><span><i>Sandra Y.

{"title": "NASA Needs a Rebirth | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Yesterday marked the long-awaited liftoff of SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Media outlets paraded the advent of commercial spaceflight, surely an exciting event, but yesterday\u2019s historic launch also may come to represent the day the commodification of outer space started to eclipse the grander mission the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has traditionally held of exploring space for the benefit of humanity. Such a possibility is saddening, as the value of space exploration beyond tours to the outer reaches of our atmosphere is indeed vast, and mankind is the worse off for ignoring it.</span></p> <p><span>Last fall, NASA <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2011-309\">reported</a> that its spacecraft Cassini had completed its mission flying around Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus and taking photos. The moon was a point of curiosity due to its mysterious jets of salty water vapor and ice. The ocean-like salty water had tremendous implications, as Nicolas Altibelli, the European Space Agency\u2019s lead scientist for Cassini, <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/cassini20110622.html\">explained</a> that this showed that life- supporting conditions on ice moons and planets were possible. Reports like these often take us far beyond the everyday realms of Earth. We are forced to ask questions of philosophy and existence: Where did life come from? Where could it be going? Are we alone?</span></p> <p><span>However, these research missions and the questions that follow them often do not produce profits, while representing enormous risk. The privatization of space travel has made extraterrestrial tours likely, but companies like SpaceX will try to minimize costs while maximizing revenue. With the excitement surrounding commercial spaceflight, the exploration of space for the purpose of finding out more about our universe may become a secondary concern, both politically and culturally.</span></p> <p><span>In 2010, President Obama <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/news/media/trans/obama_ksc_trans.html\">announced</a> that he would be canceling the Constellation spaceflight program\u2014the replacement for NASA\u2019s storied space shuttles\u2014along with plans for manned spaceflight to the moon. Under this new initiative, the first possibility of manned spaceflight to an extraterrestrial body would be an orbit around Mars sometime in the 2030s. Though the use of commercial vehicles is not an entirely negative development, as NASA\u2019s bureaucracy often needlessly increases costs, the significant reduction of NASA\u2019s influence caused by the cancellation of the Constellation program and the lunar missions is. President Obama needs to increase NASA\u2019s budget as well as state a more definite goal to reach either the Moon again or Mars in less than twenty years.</span></p> <p><span>Due to Congressional budget cuts, NASA\u2019s budget is steadily <a href=\"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/space/os-nasa-budget-worries-20110830,0,4410583.story\">declining</a>, to the detriment of everyone living on our planet. An increase in NASA\u2019s budget, no matter how ambitious, would be pennies relative to other significant governmental spending. NASA\u2019s budget for 2011 was a bit under $20 billion, but put that number in context: the United States spent over <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/06/25/137414737/among-the-costs-of-war-20b-in-air-conditioning?ps=cprs\">$20 billion</a> for air-conditioning in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2011. While the return on investment of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has been at best questionable, the engineering ingenuity required to send vehicles and humans to space is so vast that NASA\u2019s research has spawned countless <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/5893387/Apollo-11-moon-landing-top-15-Nasa-inventions.html\">masterpieces of engineering</a> that are now commonplace. Though NASA should not function as a government-sponsored research and development center for useful inventions, the positive externalities of NASA\u2019s research have been so monumental that they are hard to ignore.</span></p> <p><span>Clearly, something can be done to increase NASA\u2019s yearly budget, but public support (or lack thereof) is the problem. NASA\u2019s yearly budget has been <a href=\"http://www.asi.org/images/2003/NASA-budget-as-percentage-1962-2004-MM.png\">decreasing</a> as a proportion of the federal budget every year since 1965, but people do not realize, or care. In a paper published in Space Policy, Roger Launius, the curator of planetary exploration programs at the Smithsonian Institute, <a href=\"http://si.academia.edu/RogerLaunius/Papers/93299/_Public_Opinion_Polls_and_Perceptions_of_US_Human_Spaceflight_\">found</a> that in 1997 the \u201caverage estimate of NASA\u2019s share of the federal budget by those polled was 20 percent. If this were true, NASA\u2019s budget in 1997 would have been $328 billion.\u201d The vast ignorance that surrounds NASA\u2019s budget is a significant reason it has been shrinking.</span></p> <p><span>President Obama needs to specify a mission to either the Moon or Mars and set a firm deadline \u00e0 la John F. Kennedy \u201940. This would create a target for NASA to work towards and a tangible goal that the American public can easily understand. The money that would be needed to expand NASA to allow manned flights to the Moon and Mars is there, but public support to open the Congressional purse is not. Increased educational outreach efforts would help Americans understand how important NASA continues to be, and if persuasive enough, might let them be more generous with their money. Most of all, we need to dream again. After all, $30 or $40 billion a year for an institution that transports human beings beyond the confines of our rock is anything but expensive.</span></p> <p><span><i>Whan Lee \u201915, a Crimson editorial writer, will live in Kirkland House.</i></span></p>"}

{"title": "Mitt Romney\u2019s Russia | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For a candidate whose foreign policy expertise was presumably sharpened by his two year mission in Europe, Mitt Romney\u2019s pronunciations on the Russian Federation are especially surprising. In recent weeks, Romney\u2019s views on Russia have come into focus and become more widely scrutinized, notably in recent articles in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/12/us/politics/romneys-view-of-russia-sparks-debate.html?pagewanted=all\">The New York Times</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/mitt-romney-and-russia-geopolitical-foe-at-the-un/2012/03/27/gIQATzCneS_blog.html\">The Washington Post</a>.</span></p> <p><span>In one exceptional and already notorious case, the Republican candidate elect stated that Russia was the United States\u2019s \u201cnumber one geopolitical foe.\u201d Although he would admit that states like Iran and North Korea pose a greater immediate threat to global stability, Romney appears to cling to the implicit assumption that a post-Soviet Russia still poses the gravest danger to American interests. In particular, he has cited Russian support for rogue nations at the United Nations; given Russia\u2019s status as a permanent member of the Security Council, the Kremlin is able to shield regimes such as Bashar al-Assad\u2019s despotic and cruel regime in Syria from international censure.</span></p> <p><span>The logical fallacy behind Romney\u2019s conception of Russia as America\u2019s greatest enemy is apparent. Despite Romney\u2019s determination that the anchor of the former Soviet Union remains a serious threat to American freedom, the reality suggests otherwise. Admittedly, Russia today is mistrustful and suspicious of American motives, particularly regarding the construction of a missile shield in Central and Eastern Europe. At home, Russia is far from a free country; \u201cmanaged democracy,\u201d a term too often used by Western media outlets, has served as a byword for Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cUnited Russia\u201d party\u2019s domination of the political sphere for more than a decade.</span></p> <p><span>But Russia hardly qualifies as the U.S.\u2019s most pressing adversary. Rather, both the modern Russian Federation and the United States face similar challenges: both struggle, though in different ways, with the threat of Islamic-inspired fundamentalist terrorism. While the United States may face the impending question of how to deal with rising Chinese economic power, Russia has already been forced to accept economic second-power status. Unlike the U.S., Russia faces acute immediate challenges: she must confront an imminent demographic crisis arguably worse than anything faced by the least fecund Western European countries. While Russian GDP growth had been phenomenal under the first few years of Putin\u2019s administration, the long-term outlook for an extractive-resource and, specifically, petro-state economy seems uncertain.</span></p> <p><span>Both Russia and the United States face similar challenges, albeit to different extremes, of how to reduce large nuclear arsenals, push back terrorism, and address long-term competitiveness issues. In the post-Soviet era, the two countries have been on remarkably good terms considering their Cold War relations. With that in mind, the Republicans\u2019 apparent desire to return to imminent nuclear-war rivalry is quite baffling.</span></p> <p><span>Mr. Romney would do well to avoid characterizing Russia as evil. His own understanding of Russian relations can in part be informed or explained by the suggestion that he views foreign policy as a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/12/us/politics/romneys-view-of-russia-sparks-debate.html?pagewanted=all\">zero sum</a>\" game. Such an outlook bears a depressing resemblance to former president George W. Bush\u2019s pronouncement to the effect of \u201cyou are either with us or against us.\u201d Good or evil, blessed or satanic; these are the kinds of counterproductive, black and white judgments that Barack Obama, however successful or not he has been at foreign policy, has at least avoided in his administration. It would be a shame to revert to this good-evil divide.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, Romney and the American public would do well to recognize who is working to deliver reform and democracy in Russia and who is hindering this effort. Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index regularly lists the world\u2019s largest country as among the most corrupt. In many cases, large-scale corruption has also turned Russia into a violent and lawless state. Witness the now well-known death of Moscow lawyer Sergei L. Magnitsky and the U.S. Congress\u2019 subsequent effort to pass the \u201cMagnistsky Act\u201d aimed at targeting corrupt bureaucrats and security officials thought to be behind Magnitsky\u2019s death after he exposed a massive fraud. Romney and the Republican Party would do well to draw the distinction between an ill-informed view of a \u201cRussia\u201d driven by ulterior motives and the reality: the desire of Russians to secure a more ethical and democratic future for their country.</span></p> <p><span>Russia is not the U.S.\u2019s best friend, but neither should the two states be anything approaching real enemies. Romney\u2019s conception of Russia is indeed confusing to today\u2019s generation of young Americans who have grown up in a post-Cold War era, and who in many cases know\u2014or are among\u2014the millions of former U.S.S.R. immigrants who have moved to the United States.</span></p> <p><span>Russia has changed and modernized considerably since the fall of the Soviet Union. Any visitor to today\u2019s Moscow would surely balk at the idea that the capital represents Washington D.C.\u2019s top adversary. Romney\u2019s own misguided stance re-emphasizes the need to interact with contemporary powers through diplomacy and understanding rather than jingoistic and uninformed nationalism.</span></p>"}
{"title": "A More Uncertain Future | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Each year, the Crimson releases the senior survey to collect and publish a picture of who-does-what after Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Today, it is estimated that just over 20 percent of graduating seniors will head into consulting or financial service sector jobs at the start of their post-college lives next year. Consulting stands as the most favored career path, drawing over 12 percent of graduates; finance will bring in just under 9 percent. Together, these may seem like big numbers for two relatively narrow career paths.</span></p> <p><span>But consider the statistics from previous years. Ignoring, for a second, the previous year and the two years before it, take 2008: Around 37 percent went into finance or consulting, and 40 percent into \u201cbusiness.\u201d But even that looks insignificant compared to the year before: In 2007, a full 47 percent of graduating seniors went into the two sectors that have become synonymous with a big-bucks Wall Street future. Does this point to a change of culture at Harvard and to the reduced influence of aggressive, for-profit companies\u2019 recruiting tactics on campus?</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps. As we have argued in the past, undergraduates risk going into sectors and jobs because they value safe post-college options that offer transferable skills and transition easily to other sectors. If finance\u2014often used as a byword for working at investment banks\u2014and management consulting have lost some of their luster, this may not all be a bad thing.</span></p> <p><span>Spun a little differently, we could also say that the percentage of seniors entering what have traditionally been the best-paying entry-level positions in the United States\u2019 job market has collapsed by more than half over the past five years. This may be due to a change in culture on campus. But even this change in students\u2019 mentality is inescapably a product of the driving force behind the shifting employment landscape of Harvard graduates. This is the enduring legacy of the financial crisis\u2014on campus, across the U.S., and around the world.</span></p> <p><span>While we are all conscious of the deep, visible psychological effects felt around us and our families by the Great Recession, it is a point less often made that the Class of 2012 has had a rather unique experience with economic crisis. When today\u2019s seniors were settling into their freshman dorms, safely ensconced in the Yard far from upperclassmen concerns like jobs and theses, they were also reading about the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. They listened to their parents and to their then-president, who with customary eloquence summed up the situation with the following: \u201cThis sucker could go down.\u201d Fall 2008\u2019s freshmen, then, could have been forgiven for being just a little anxious as to what the world might look like when one day in the distant future they too went on the job hunt. All around, predictions were dark. The end of capitalism was forecast. Democracy would soon be under threat in several countries. The way of life to which American 18-year-olds had all more or less become accustomed was under threat. Excessive debt, faulty mortgages, and runaway capitalism were\u2014and still are, if you believe many in the media\u2014ruining the American dream. If you believe Mitt Romney, on the other hand, then it is clear that under Barack Obama, the U.S. has remained in dire straits.</span></p> <p><span>It is true, to a certain extent, that the U.S. has still not recovered from 2008-09. Official unemployment remains far above historic figures for the American economy, at over 8 percent. Other estimates, which count the full percentage of the working-age population out of work\u2014as opposed to just those actively looking\u2014place the true figure at above 11 percent, and as high as 17.5 percent at the height of the crisis. For young Americans, the picture is mixed. While college graduates have a far lower unemployment rate than the work force as a whole, the prospects for young people without an undergraduate degree are far worse and not completely rosy even for those possessing one.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, it would be wrong to paint too dark a picture of Harvard graduates\u2019 employment prospects. 2012\u2019s senior survey reveals that 68 percent of graduating seniors already have jobs, down from pre-recession highs of 73 percent in 2007 but far better than at the height of the financial crisis. This figure is encouraging for today\u2019s graduating seniors.</span></p> <p><span>That students earning a degree from a college as prestigious as Harvard should be well-employed is hardly surprising. There should be little doubt that Harvard graduates are and will remain among the most employable young people in the country. Moreover, the last thing any well-educated young person\u2014Harvard or otherwise\u2014should do today is panic. The broader state of the U.S. economy is not quite as gloomy as the Republican Party would have us believe; gross domestic product growth of roughly 2 percent a year, while not stellar, hardly qualifies as a crisis.</span></p> <p><span>The real problem, and one that does affect Harvard graduates as much as it does every person living in the U.S., is that long-term prospects for the United States\u2019s role in a still-globalizing and fast-shifting world economy are more uncertain.</span></p> <p><span>Now that we are all left with the memory of the worst recession since the Great Depression, it is hard not to worry that another crisis could be just around the corner. Similarly, will young Americans today enjoy the same standard of living and, to put it bluntly, ease that so many of our parents\u2019 generation have? Will the future leaders of our generation of Americans also be the most powerful and influential leaders of the world?</span></p> <p><span>Being poised to become influential in the United States may no longer carry quite the same global cach\u00e9 as it has in the past. The country in which Harvard is a leading institution, and from whose success Harvard has benefited so much, stands in a more uncertain global position\u2014in large part because the financial crisis is considered to have accelerated the convergence in strength and size of developed and developing economies.

{"title": "Emerging from the Shadow | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The 2011-12 academic year is a momentous one for its class of seniors. What is momentous for others, for the nation at large? The ongoing recovery from the financial crisis, a topic addressed in greater detail separately by our staff today? The related Eurozone crisis? The beginning of the 2012 general election, with the carnival of the Republican primary and the growing centrality of social issues in the clash between President Barack Obama and presumptive Republican\u00a0nominee Mitt Romney?</span></p> <p><span>Looking back further to the start of the year\u2014the fall semester\u2014one issue looms inevitably large, both for the United States and for today\u2019s generation of young people. This was, of course, the anniversary marking one decade since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.</span></p> <p><span>With the events of September 11 now more than a decade behind us, it seems at times as if the wound has scarcely healed. The event itself was a tragedy beyond words, but in retrospect, perhaps it was also a portent of things to come. Indeed, in the decade since September 11, the United States has stumbled from one frustrating war to another and seen its once-robust economy nearly brought to its knees, bringing pain and suffering to millions across the country.</span></p> <p><span>In many ways, the post-9/11 world has also separated the decade-long post-Soviet honeymoon from a far more fraught and challenging time for the United States. The days of unthreatened American hegemony had come to an end. Before the end of this decade, the Chinese economy will very likely become the world\u2019s largest. For all the political rhetoric, there is a very real fear that America\u2019s education system is falling behind; that American workers are no longer the world\u2019s best; that American exceptionalism is merely an illusion; that America will never again regain the place in the world it once occupied.</span></p> <p><span>The Class of 2012 leaves the rather protective sphere of Harvard for this uncertain world. Often, our time at Harvard leaves us in a state of virtual insularity, blinding us to the uncertainty of the outside world. Nevertheless our lives after September 11 have been affected by many consequences, tangible and intangible, that have modified our activities and even changed the way we view our liberties. We are reminded of this occasionally: We have grown familiar with the Department of Homeland Security as we submit to scrutiny at Logan Airport. Likewise, the Patriot Act has permitted an unprecedented level of government surveillance. Yet as citizens, we would do well not to fall into complacence and to guard our civil liberties jealously, as rights rather than privileges.</span></p> <p><span>On another level, pernicious scars of xenophobia and intolerance are also a legacy of September 11. These attitudes are inevitable reactions to a terrorist attack executed by Islamic extremists. However, as the recent popularity of the Tea Party and its inflammatory rhetoric shows, they threaten to take hold in the wider national psyche. This is something we must continue to be wary of.</span></p> <p><span>From a more global perspective, the generation of Harvard seniors that graduates this week represents the first college class to have spent more time in the shadow of September 11 than outside of it. They have come of age in an era marked not by American power, but by its limitations; they have witnessed the horror of Abu Ghraib, the disappointment of Guantanamo, and the endless misery in Afghanistan. They take this knowledge with them into the world, and they must choose what to do with it. Some may cynically choose to view our times as reflective of the shortcomings of human nature. Yet some\u2014and, let us hope, most\u2014will view the shortcomings of these days as a call to action for a better, more humane future.</span></p> <p><span>Thankfully, there are already signs that point to such a future. Osama bin Laden\u2019s death last year, at the hands of Navy SEALs, gave the nation an opportunity to lay a ghost to rest. As the spontaneous celebrations that took place in Harvard Yard, outside the White House, and across the country demonstrated, the wound left in the American psyche by 9/11 had far from healed. It was notable that many of those who turned out were young people, in keeping with the exceptional influence of 9/11 on our generation.</span></p> <p><span>Hopefully, as we argued at the time, bin Laden\u2019s death\u2014now more than a year passed\u2014provides an opportunity for much-needed renewal and a chance to move on from 9/11. From his lonely grave somewhere at sea, he no longer haunts our collective consciousness. His absence has been complimented by a new presence in the New York skyline\u2014that of the new World Trade Center, which just last month became the tallest building in the city. Its presence will not erase the memory of the Twin Towers that came before it, but Daniel Libeskind\u2019s creation has filled a gaping physical hole in the city\u2019s heart and will continue to impress as it is completed. With time, perhaps the gash in the nation\u2019s soul will also come to heal.</span></p> <p><span>As the reconstruction continues, it is clear that America cannot recapture the past. Perhaps its days as the world\u2019s only superpower will soon be over, but the country still has much to give to the rest of the world. Let us remember and honor the achievements of the past and recognize and learn from the mistakes of the present as we look toward the future. Times will certainly be different. But whether they are better\u2014a reemergence, a restoration, even a redemption\u2014depends on us and our ability to emerge from the shadow of 9/11 into a brighter world.</span></p>"}
{"title": "An Interview with Ayman Nour | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>After 16 months and a series of dramatic hurdles, election day for Egypt finally arrives. Today and tomorrow mark the first round of Egypt\u2019s presidential election with the expected runoff between the two largest recipients of votes slated for June 16, 2012. Originally considered a two-horse race between Amr Moussa, former head of the Arab League, and Abdel Moneim Abul-Foutouh, the former Muslim Brotherhood leader, the race has opened dramatically over the last month. Now, at least five candidates seem capable of making the runoff with the three additions of the Nasserite, Hamdeen Sabahi, the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s official candidate, Mohamed Mursi, and a former minister of former President Hosni Mubarak\u2019s executive cabinet, Ahmed Shafiq.</span></p> <p><span>Under international pressure, President Mubarak held Egypt\u2019s first ever-contested presidential election in 2005. Dr. Ayman Nour, founder of the independent Ghad Party and an activist with a reputation for causing trouble, challenged Mubarak, earning nine percent of the vote in an election plagued by widespread fraud. Predictably, the government locked Dr. Nour into prison on false charges until his eventual release for medical reasons in 2009.</span></p> <p><span>At the start of the Egyptian revolution last January, over 20 percent of Egyptians said they would vote for Ayman Nour, according to one poll. Unfortunately, in April of this year, the Election Committee prohibited Dr. Nour, along with nine other candidates, from entering the election. In Dr. Nour\u2019s case, his \u201ccrimes\u201d\u2014 agitating the previous regime\u2014 prevented his candidacy. Regardless, Dr. Nour remains one of the most influential liberal and secular voices in the Egyptian political scene.</span></p> <p><span>Last week, I interviewed Dr. Nour in his Cairo apartment. Below are pieces of our conversation:</span></p> <p><span><i>Egypt is one week from its first-ever legitimate presidential election. As someone imprisoned for participating in its first-ever contested presidential elections in 2005, did you ever expect that Egypt would reach this day?</i></span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span>Honestly, I was expecting a better day than today and a better situation than this one. This election that is being completed now is really just a half-election. The first half of the election occurred far from the ballot box at the hands of the election committee, which removed 10 strong candidates, including me, from the election. None of us were allowed to return, except Ahmed Shafiq [who was a prominent minister in Mubarak\u2019s executive cabinet].</span></p> <p><span><i>With the day-to-day coverage, we seem to forget how far Egypt has come in 16 months. How does Egypt of today differ from the Egypt of 2010?</i></span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span>If you entered a place that I had recently painted, then, sure, you would at first feel that something has changed. But we wanted to rebuild the country. We did not want to repaint it from the outside. We never reached deep enough to change the structures of the country. We were painting Egypt\u2019s exterior, but we wanted to reform the inside. We want the usual or normal Egyptian citizen to feel like his life was improved by the revolution and he regained his dignity. The demands of the revolution have not been met.</span></p> <p><span><i>How do you think the failure to write a new constitution before the presidential elections will affect the position of the Presidency after the elections?</i></span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span>Yes, it may affect the transition process, but we don\u2019t want to write a constitution that we will be forced to rewrite a year or two later. We should take a year or the appropriate time to write a constitution that could last a century.</span></p> <p><span><i>You have discussed the role of liberals in the revolution on many occasions. What should be the political role of liberals if a non-liberal wins the Presidential Election? And how can liberals become influential again in the political scene?</i></span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span>If a non-liberal wins the election, we will accept the election\u2019s outcome no matter the result because we are democratic people. But we will go back to work in the opposition, since there is still a system we have political differences with. We will go back to resisting all political monopolies like we have for the last 55 years. We were resisting a military dictatorship and we would resist an Islamist version of it for the principle of fighting authoritarianism. We are Muslims and [the Ghad party] has Islamic understandings and we have a good, strong relationship with Al-Azhar and we respect Al-Azhar\u2019s main figures. We do not have a problem with religion. We have a problem with the people who govern in the name of religion. I am not with any monopoly. If the liberals were monopolizing power, then I would be against it. We are forced to go back to being an opposition. It is written in our fate to be in the opposition.</span></p> <p><span><i>The election campaign in Egypt has been short compared to most election campaigns in the World. Do you think that the campaigns have not been able to fully express in their programs? Are there any issues that the candidates have not discussed adequately?</i></span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span>There are many issues.</span></p> <p><span><i>For instance?</i></span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span>The conversation between the military and the civil sphere about the future and the present is a very important issue that should have been clearly discussed in the presidential debates or candidate platforms. We all put our heads in the sand like ostriches. When the military comes up, we all respect the \u201cbig, great, and important military institution\u201d or whatever. Those words are just rhetoric. Those words must be translated through a clear vision on our position on the military budget. What\u2019s our position on the transparency on the budget? What\u2019s our position dealing with the laws regarding the military? Will this issue be discussed with them or be agreed upon somehow? Is the military looking for a ruling role or not? What\u2019s our position if the military is looking for that? My opinion is that this subject was never discussed in an honest way. Every talk regarding these questions is just lip service to satisfy the military or compliment it. There are no specific statements. This is a very important point in time because this is the point when the military will either hand over power to a civil elected power or not hand it over. This would return us to the scenario of 1954 in Egypt and other times. I think these are important issues and they require discussion.</span></p> <p><span><i>Do you think there is a possibility for a second revolution or do you think that, at this point, people are tired and prefer stability?</i></span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span>The people want stability, but the people also wont accept the revolution\u2019s defeat. I do not want to predict what will happen if Ahmed Shafiq wins the elections. I don\u2019t want to say that because I\u2019m someone who believes in democracy and the results of elections. But I\u2019m sure that if a person like Ahmed Shafiq succeeds, there are others who believe less in democracy and they will not accept the election\u2019s results. People will go to Tahrir Square immediately to demand the fall of a president who is the same flesh and blood of [President Mubarak]. Anyway, we have fears for the date of Mubarak\u2019s trial, June 2. And we have fears for what could occur after that. And we have fears that the election results will come out in a way that will provoke the passions and emotions of many Egyptians.</span></p> <p><span><i>Presidents Nasser, Sadat, and Mubarak all pursued very different economic policies and each left his own mark in Egypt\u2019s economic sphere. What do you expect from the next President and how will it serve Egypt?</i></span></p> <p><span>Truly, the next President will face a huge economic problem and his presidency will begin with this crisis at hand. He must aim to face a great number a crises like the water from the Nile, which is an explosive problem. Also, he will have problems with the rates of development. And he will face a problem with the amount of internal and external public debt, which is increasing, and already eating a third of Egypt\u2019s yearly budget. And he will have unbalanced trade and unbalanced spending and he will face a crisis in all sectors of the economy. So there should be a comprehensive agenda to face the economic crisis in Egypt.</span></p> <p><span><i>Two weeks ago, your political party, the Ghad party, announced that it would not support Abul-Fotouh or Mursi. What do you fear from a President with an Islamist background?</i></span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span>No, we have no fears from anyone for their Islamist background, but we are afraid of having a single authority with legislative power and executive power and this would be a kind of monopolization of political power. But we don\u2019t have a problem with the Islamist movement. We are cooperating with Islamists and there is permanent contact and permanent coordination between us. But we are not with a President who represents the Islamist orientation in light of the presence of Islamists in the People\u2019s Assembly, the Shura Council, and the Cabinet.</span></p> <p><span><i>In the last couple weeks, many public figures, including many liberals and revolutionary youth groups, have announced their support for Hamdeen Sabahi, what do you think about that trend?</i></span></p> <p><span>Sabahi is a colleague and a friend and I love Hamdeen so much. Friendships like this sometimes lead public figures to support their friends politically. So, in other words, if I did not have a political party or a political movement that I were responsible for, and I could chose with my heart, then I would choose Hamdeen. But this maybe does not translate to real opportunities in the street.</span></p> <p><span><i>In the last couple weeks, Ahmed Shafiq has finished first or second in some national polls. Since Shafiq worked in the former regime, do you, as someone who was imprisoned by the former regime, think his victory would mean the revolution was stolen or in vain?</i></span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span>[long pause]\u2026 For 35 years I kept a packed handbag in my house at all times in case I was detained. I have been detained many times since I was 15 years old. Shortly after the revolution, I got rid of the handbag. Before then, there was always a place for it in my house so I could take it at anytime. I expect that if Ahmed Shafiq becomes President, then I must prepare the handbag once again and put it back in its place.</span></p> <p><span><i>The tone of candidates\u2019 statements on Israel is heating up as the election date nears. What do you expect will happen to the relationship between Egypt and Israel?</i></span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span>The relationship is ruled by a lot of considerations. [The relationship] will never get as bad as the people imagine, but it will not continue in Mubarak\u2019s way because his way was a humiliating way. Egypt is new. Egypt is different. There is a new variable in the political equation called public opinion and this needs to be respected. Israel and its friends should take into consideration the new Egypt\u2019s influential public opinion and not provoke or pressure it either. In the end, the decision of the president will be a decision with a big relationship to public opinion. This does not mean that is necessary for the new President to be reckless with this public opinion and I do not think that any President will be ready for a new war in this region. But the relationship between the two countries will freeze and reach a very bad level if Israel does not take into consideration the new influence of Egyptian public opinion, which could pressure the new President.</span></p> <p><span><i>A spokesperson from the U.S. State Department described these statements as simply campaign rhetoric to rally support. Do you agree?</i></span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span>[Silently nods and smiles]</span></p> <p><span><i>According to Egypt\u2019s state news agency, the Egyptian intelligence apparatus mediated the resolution of the recent Palestinian hunger strike. In general, do you think the role of Egypt internationally, and specifically on Palestinian issues, will grow following the elections?</i></span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span>I think the new Egypt will have a wide role and it will not be just a small broker anymore in Israel and America\u2019s political equations. We must understand this very well. The next Egypt will be much stronger than before, more aware of its international role. Turkey, Iran, and Egypt are the regional focal points. Egypt will play this role efficiently with the new elected President.</span></p> <p><span><i>You described the focal points of the Middle East as Turkey, Iran, and Egypt. Arguably, in the last few decades, Saudi Arabia replaced Egypt in that triangle. How can Egypt return to its old position while maintaining a stable relationship with Saudi Arabia?</i></span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span>Look, since the establishment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia there was a field of competition between [Egypt and Saudi Arabia]. Let me give you an old example. Why is America now changing their traditional coalition from Pakistan to India? We are India. Egypt is India. Egypt has the larger population. [America] went to India because of its large population to place India against China. Egypt represents the same population weight of India so Egypt must be the most important factor in the Middle East equation even if it is a monetarily poor factor. Yet, Saudi Arabia is the traditional ally of America. In my opinion, Egypt is the most important and the most complicated factor in the region\u2019s political equation. The population and geographical weights play a large role. Egypt became politically smaller because the political regime was crippled and weak and constrained by personal problems. [Mubarak] was not prepared to defend Egypt. He was defending his personal presence instead. When Americans were telling him, \u201cSolve the problems of Ayman Nour.\u201d So he was accepting anything they imposed upon him because he wanted to close these files. Today the new Egypt is a stronger Egypt than the previous regime. It will not be better than Mubarak\u2019s regime on the economic level, but it will be better politically because it will have general support and the public opinion, which the government will base its decisions on. I expect Egypt to return to its former political position by virtue of its weight, like India, and also we are seeing that a lot of important factors in the Middle East equation are changing on the other side of the equation. I think the political situations in the Gulf area\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say they will change, but they will develop. Actually, they will be changed. Egypt, Turkey, and Iran will be the strongest powers in the next era.</span></p> <p><span><i>In 2008, you penned a famous letter to then-presidential candidate, Barack Obama. If you were to write a letter to President Obama today, what would be your message?</i></span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span>First of all, it was not a letter, but an article titled \u201cLetter to Obama.\u201d At that time there was a debate between [Hillary] Clinton and [Barack] Obama about what would happen if the President received a call at three in the morning about a crisis that threatened American interests in the Middle East and who would be prepared to answer that phone call. If I write Obama a message now, what I would tell him is, \u201cAll the phone calls you received at three a.m., four a.m., and five a.m. were never answered.\u201d While Obama and Clinton are in the same administration, and they were originally asking who would take the phone call between them, but in fact the telephones are broken and they never answered any phone calls. From my viewpoint, the threat to the interests of the United States is the threat to the principles of the United States, which happens when freedoms are violated in this region. America made no moves. As a state that respects freedoms and human rights, the threat happened in many regions and is still happening in many regions. And we are still asking why don\u2019t they ask the phone calls that ring at 3 a.m. in an administration with both Obama and Clinton. Obama disappointed us in some issues but Clinton has disappointed us in everything. The State Department always takes a worse position than the White House.</span></p> <p><span><i>How do you grade Obama\u2019s Administration over the last four years? Are you supporting his reelection?</i></span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span>Look, Obama reminds me of a 95-year old story about the American President, Woodrow Wilson, and this man [points to painting behind him], Saad Zaghloul, an Egyptian leader during Egypt\u2019s 1919 revolution. In 1919, the Egyptian people chanted the names of Woodrow Wilson and Saad Zaghloul together. This was because Wilson wrote the \u201cFourteen Principles\u201d [for the Treaty of Versailles after the First World War]. But, after a period of time, Wilson accepted the continued British occupation of Egypt. The people that previously chanted for Wilson then entered the streets calling for his downfall because he disappointed the people. This is my answer to that question.</span></p> <p><span><i>Dr. Ayman Nour is an Egyptian politician and chairman of the Ghad El-Thwara Party. Eric T.

{"title": "Derrick Bell's Legacy | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Caroline M. McKay", "body": "<p><span>Twenty-two years after becoming Harvard Law School\u2019s first tenured black professor, Derrick A. Bell Jr.\u2019s hairline was receding and his patience wearing out. He wore round glasses and a gray suit, holding his notes in both hands and speaking into a half-dozen microphones.</span></p> <p><span>Signs at the protest bobbed up and down, all handwritten. \u201cShame on HLS,\u201d one of them read. \u201cIs the United States 95 percent male and 91 percent white? Harvard Law School is,\u201d read another.</span></p> <p><span>At the time of this protest\u2014one of many he held at the Law School between 1986 and 1991\u2014there were five tenured female professors at the Law School, and three tenured black professors, all male.</span></p> <p><span>So in 1991, Bell took a \u201cleave of conscience.\u201d He would return only when the 107 female black students were represented by a tenured faculty member.</span></p> <p><span>But Bell was not just protesting the lack of a female black professors, according to Law School professor Kenneth Mack. Bell initiated a conversation about the value of diversity in the classroom\u2014through diversity in legal scholarship. He was also one of the founders of critical race theory, a body of legal scholarship that examines the relationship between race and law.</span></p> <p><span>Bell would never return to the Law School\u2014the leave evolved into a dismissal. After two years of leave, a Harvard professor must return to teach in order to maintain tenure. But after two years, the Law School had not hired a female black professor. Since Bell did not return, he was fired.</span></p> <p><span>In October of this year, Bell passed away at age 80. According to Mack, \u201che was one of the voices in the many conversations that collectively change the Law School.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Though Bell would never return to Harvard, his actions two decades ago were part of a larger debate that would grip\u2014and ultimately transform\u2014the Law School, making it a community more inclusive of diverse theory and experience.</span></p> <p><span><b>CHARGED CAMPUS</b></span></p> <p><span>As Bell was having a crisis of conscience about teaching among an overwhelmingly white faculty, the overwhelmingly white faculty was having a crisis of its own. The ideological differences that sharply divided the faculty were making national headlines.</span></p> <p><span>In an article that was published in 1993, GQ Magazine dubbed the Law School \u201cBeirut-on-the-Charles,\u201d describing a campus that \u201cpitted faculty members against faculty members, faculty members against students,\u201d and students \u201cwaging holy war on one another.\u201d As a union of liberal and conservative students, the Harvard Law Review did not escape the tension that seemed to permeate the campus.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve worked at the Supreme Court; I\u2019ve worked at the White House; I\u2019ve been in Washington now for 20 years. And the bitterest politics I\u2019ve ever seen\u2014in terms of it getting personal and nasty\u2014was on the Harvard Law Review,\u201d said Bradford A. Benderson in a documentary produced by Frontline, \u201cDreams of Obama.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>These emotions spilled over into Bell\u2019s protest.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cProfessor Bell made people who disagreed with him angry,\u201d Mack said. \u201cThere were professors and students who were very caustic.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Benderson, along with Mack, was an editor of the Law Review when Barack Obama was the president of the publication. Obama spoke at one of Bell\u2019s protests, alluding to the kind of compassionate pedagogy that set Bell apart at the Law School. A young Obama, wearing a blue button-down shirt and khaki pants, spoke with his hands in his pockets.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI remember him sauntering up to the front, and not giving us a lecture, but engaging us in a conversation. And speaking the truth,\u201d Obama said of Bell in his speech at the time.</span></p> <p><span><b>GROWING DIVERSE</b></span></p> <p><span>The conversation that Bell started continues to play out at the Law School today.</span></p> <p><span>The Law School faculty is significantly more diverse. In 1990, only five tenured professors were women and three tenured professors were black. In 2011, there were seven senior black professors, and 20 percent of all professors were women, compared with 12 percent in 1990. There were also three Asian senior faculty members, one senior Latino professor, and one senior Native American professor, <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/5/8/warren-maginn-faust-letter/\">presumed to be Elizabeth Warren</a>. The first tenured black female professor was Lani Guinier \u201971, who received tenure in 1998.</span></p> <p><span>Growing a faculty takes decades, according to a Morris Ratner, a former student at the Law School who completed two years as a visiting professor. But a more diverse faculty translates to a more diverse learning experience, he added. \u201cFaculty members\u2019 life experience shape what they teach and how they teach, so we thought having a more diverse faculty would bring more diversity to the classroom,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>He continued that being able to relate to faculty members is important for students.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBack when I was in law school, if you were a gay student, there was no openly gay faculty member that you could identify with on that very basic level of identity,\u201d said Ratner. \u201cIt was that much harder to walk into office hours.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>\u2018THINK LIKE A LAWYER\u2019</b></span></p> <p><span>When Mack was a student, he said the Law School taught students how to \u201cthink like a lawyer\u201d\u2014in a very particular way.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere was a sense in the \u201980s that we were sorting good lawyers from bad lawyers, and that the mission of Harvard Law School was to teach\u2014or perhaps impose\u2014that on the student body,\u201d Mack said.</span></p> <p><span>Part of Bell\u2019s departure was fueled by his belief that the scholarship produced by women and minorities was devalued by the Law School, which at the time opted for a prescribed, hierarchical conception of law and legal education.</span></p> <p><span>But in the decades since Bell left, the faculty has diversified ideologically.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMore conservative faculty have been appointed in the last decade, and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d said Charles J. Ogletree Jr., a professor at the Law School and director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice.</span></p> <p><span>Mack said that these recent hires show that the Law School has become more inclusive.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that we are now much more humble about [the Law School\u2019s] ability to define the rest of the world,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>But while the Law School is more diverse than it used to be, the faculty still does not reflect the make-up of the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think there\u2019s a long way to go,\u201d Mack said. \u201cOne simply has to look at the faculty members and count\u201d to see that the picture is not yet complete.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Caroline M.

{"title": "Healthcare Immunity | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In the 26 months since its passage, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly called \u201cObamacare,\u201d has revolutionized healthcare and insurance practices across the nation and triggered rancorous political debate. Although most of its provisions have yet to take effect, both health care providers and employers have scrambled to comply with the requirements of the act by the time each requirement becomes operative within the next few years.</span></p> <p><span>But for Harvard, the act does not spell chaos or upheaval. In fact, Harvard\u2019s own healthcare services and insurance programs will hardly require any retooling at all, because the University is already in compliance with Massachusetts\u2019s 2006 healthcare reform law, which overlaps substantially with the act.</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, the act has provided an opportunity for students and researchers at Harvard to examine existing healthcare regimes and the state of public health in the United States, shedding light on the flaws and advantages of the sweeping reforms ushered in by the Affordable Care Act.</span></p> <p><span><b>AHEAD OF THE CURVE</b></span></p> <p><span>Since the Affordable Care Act was signed by President Barack Obama, it has implemented policies aimed at reducing costs and increasing care for seniors, preventing discrimination against individuals with pre-existing conditions, expanding coverage for young adults, and lowering healthcare premiums.</span></p> <p><span>During the height of negotiations, John E. McDonough, a professor of public health practice at the Harvard School of Public Health, was in the eye of the storm. While assisting the Senate from 2008 to 2010 as a policy adviser, McDonough helped to fine tune the act in the run up to its passage in March 2010.</span></p> <p><span>McDonough describes the goal of the Affordable Care Act as striving to create \u201ccomprehensive reform of the U.S. health system, to improve access to health insurance, to improve the quality and efficiency of medical care, and to control the rising rate of healthcare costs.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Next year, the act will provide more funding for state Medicaid programs and children\u2019s health insurance. In 2014, the act will eliminate annual limits on services, provide tax credits, and mandate individual coverage. In 2015, it will tie physician payment to quality of care.</span></p> <p><span>For many institutions across the country these changes will require considerable administrative reorganization. But for those based in Massachusetts, the required changes will be relatively minor.</span></p> <p><span>The Massachusetts healthcare reform law, enacted by former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in 2006, improved access to health care by creating a state-operated health insurance exchange and providing subsidies for middle- and low-income individuals. It also required all adult residents of the state to have insurance. Compliance with this existing law has allowed for a smoother transition to the Affordable Care Act for employers and healthcare providers across the state.</span></p> <p><span>Michael E. Chernew, professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School, described Massachusetts as already \u201cfar down the road\u201d in complying with the Affordable Care Act requirements.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhatever one thinks about the Affordable Care Act, it is probably less relevant to Massachusetts,\u201d Chernew says.</span></p> <p><span>By virtue of its geographic location and its previous policies, Harvard also is far down the road in terms of compliance, steering clear of most of the reorganization that will take place at many other healthcare institutions.</span></p> <p><span><b>CHECKING THE BOX</b></span></p> <p><span>Although many Harvard students have engaged in heated debates about the act, they are unlikely to be directly affected by the legislation in their capacity as Harvard students.</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard University Student Health Program will not require significant alterations to accommodate the changes mandated by the act because it is a self-insured student health plan, meaning that it provides both insurance and health care services to Harvard students.</span></p> <p><span>By acting as both an insurer and a healthcare provider, Harvard University Health Services avoids many of the bureaucratic obstacles faced by institutions that play only one of those roles. However, members of Harvard\u2019s federal relations team had to inquire with Washington policymakers to seek clarity about what the act would actually mean for institutions of higher education, according to Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin.</span></p> <p><span>Many of the requirements of the act\u2014which include providing preventative care at no cost, accepting individuals with pre-existing conditions, and eliminating lifetime or annual dollar limits\u2014were already in effect in the Harvard University Health Student Program before the act became a law, according to Lindsey Garofalo, communications officer for HUHS.</span></p> <p><span>The Student Health Planning Committee had voluntarily made changes that were in line with the requirements of the act well before its passage, Garofalo wrote in an email. However, students may feel the effects of the act after graduating from Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>The act expanded coverage for young people, allowing individuals under the age of 26 to remain on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans. For young adults in Massachusetts, who are already required by law to be insured, this provision means that they will no longer be required to purchase individual health plans for several years after graduating from college.</span></p> <p><span>Many Harvard professors agree that the act will have only minor effects on the University, both in absolute terms and compared to similar institutions in other states.</span></p> <p><span>According to Meredith B. Rosenthal, professor of health economics and policy at HSPH, the act was \u201cpolitically designed to have modest effects on everyone other than the uninsured.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Rosenthal says she believes that the most noticeable effect of the act will be the elimination of co-pays in recommended preventative care. Before the act, individuals were expected to pay part of the cost of the treatment.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMany of the changes are subtle, but cumulatively, it makes a difference for a lot of people,\u201d Rosenthal says.</span></p> <p><span><b>THE ACT UNDER THE MAGNIFYING GLASS</b></span></p> <p><span>Despite the limited repercussions at the University itself, many professors at HSPH have recently focused their research on the implications of the act, putting Harvard at the forefront of the academic debate about the act.</span></p> <p><span>Katherine Baicker, a professor of health economics at HSPH, released a paper last summer showing that increased access to Medicaid resulting from the act did not decrease costs, but rather caused them to increase. This finding contradicted claims made by proponents of the act, who believed that an increase in preventive treatment would result in lower total spending by reducing the number of emergency room visits.</span></p> <p><span>Although the price of care rose significantly, Baicker found that people were reporting improved health and fewer financial strains associated with healthcare costs.</span></p> <p><span>Rosenthal\u2019s research has examined the shared savings program for accountable care organizations, an initiative that links pay to quality of care rather than number of visits. Rosenthal says that the delivery system and payment reforms stipulated by the act will improve management and quality of health care.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI shudder to think that that could be annulled,\u201d Rosenthal says, referring to the pending Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of the law.</span></p> <p><span>Many of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be implemented, and depending on the political climate, they may never be enacted. In addition to the Supreme Court\u2019s consideration of the act, Congress may also pose a threat to its continued existence. With the fall 2012 election on the horizon, the Democrats\u2019 position in congress is precarious. With enough votes, Republicans may be able to repeal the act before many of its provisions come into effect.</span></p> <p><span>Chernew admits that the Affordable Care Act requires a \u201cconsiderable federal investment\u201d and says that it is not clear that the country is willing to finance it.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s certainly not clear that people have a better alternative,\u201d Chernew says.</span></p> <p><span>Aside from their individual research, Harvard professors have also been involved in ongoing discussions about implications of the Affordable Care Act. In March, the Harvard University Advanced Leadership Initiative, a public policy forum for experts overseen by Harvard professors, debated the potential consequences of the act for the healthcare market.</span></p> <p><span>According to HSPH professor and former dean Barry R. Bloom, academics can offer a more nuanced and objective perspective on healthcare policy than politicians and mainstream media outlets. But Bloom stresses that individuals should educate themselves about the subtleties of the act.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[With] the idiocy that goes on in the public debate...It wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone to know something,\u201d Bloom said.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Kerry M.

Srivatsa", "body": "<p><span>Just over two-thirds of Harvard seniors plan on joining the workforce  after graduation, a level consistent with percentages from the past two  years but still lower than figures prior to the start of the financial  crisis.</span></p> <p><span>Among those members of the Class of 2012 who plan on working next  year, 68.4 percent have a job lined up, according to The Crimson\u2019s sixth  annual senior survey. In 2007 prior to the financial crisis, 73 percent  of work-bound seniors had secured jobs by Commencement, according to a  similar survey of that class.</span></p> <p><span>The consulting industry will be the top destination for seniors next  year, drawing 12.4 percent of the graduating class, a one percentage  point increase from seniors last year. Education, which attracted the  greatest share of students last year following a recruitment surge by  Teach for America and similar organizations, is bringing in 11.4 percent  of seniors, a percentage roughly equal to that of last year.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps most notably, the financial sector, which has begun to  recover since jobs were slashed during the financial crisis, will  nonetheless see fewer graduates entering the industry. While 10.5  percent of the Class of 2011 headed to finance, 8.8 percent of this  year\u2019s Harvard graduates will be working in the sector.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson\u2019s survey of the Class of 2012 was conducted through a  secure website that ensured only one response per senior. It drew 420  responses between May 8 and May 14, 2012.</span></p> <p><span>While the consulting industry is the single most popular sector among  graduates, if salary were not a concern, 11 percent of respondents  would engage in public service, 13.9 percent would work in education,  and 17.7 percent said they would pursue the arts. However, only 4.1  percent of respondents said that they are actually entering the arts  next year, and 5 percent said they were entering public service.</span></p> <p><span>Slightly less than half of future consultants said they would stick  to consulting if salary were not a concern, and just one-third of future  bankers would stay in finance if they did not have to worry about pay.</span></p> <p><span>Among the one-third of seniors who do not plan on working next fall,  the vast majority\u201424 percent of the class\u2014plan on heading to graduate  school, with medical school taking the lead with 6.4 percent of  graduating seniors.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson\u2019s yearly survey asks questions ranging from employment  prospects to personal health, tracking changes in the student body over  time.</span></p> <p><span>Nearly three-quarters of the senior class considers themselves more  liberal than the average American. With a U.S. presidential election  pitting two Harvard alumni against each other, the Class of 2012, unlike  the nation, is hardly divided. President Barack Obama raked in 69.5  percent of student support, while a mere 13.3 percent of seniors said  they support Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican challenger.</span></p> <p><span>Boston, which typically attracts the greatest share of graduating  seniors, is once more this year\u2019s most popular post-graduate  destination, with 21.4 percent of respondents saying they will stay in  Beantown next year. New York will see 19.5 percent of graduates, and  14.3 percent of seniors will head to California.</span></p> <p><span>Around 17 percent of seniors will be living outside of the United  States next year, with 9.1 percent headed to Europe, 4.3 percent headed  to Asia, 1.9 percent headed to Africa.</span></p> <p><span>But despite divergent destinations, futures, and interests, Harvard  seniors overwhelmingly said they enjoyed their time in Cambridge: 91.7  percent of the Class of 2012 said they were satisfied or very satisfied  with their Harvard experience, and when presented with the option of  deciding on college again, 94.5 percent of graduates said they would  again choose Harvard.</span></p> <p><span><i>\u2014<a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/gallery/2012/5/22/senior-section-2012/\">Click here</a> to see graphs with all the findings from the survey of the Class of 2012.</i></span></p>"}

Tribe | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As the child of two Russian-Jewish immigrant parents in 1940s Shanghai, Harvard Law School Professor Laurence H. Tribe \u201962 was no stranger to injustice, a reality that set off his interest in law at an early age.</span></p> <p><span>Living under the rule of imperial Japan, Tribe\u2019s father found himself suddenly arrested after the United States declared war on Japan in December of 1941. As an \u201calien national,\u201d his only crime was having become a U.S. citizen twenty years ago.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy sense of what seemed to me the injustice of that imprisonment\u2014after all, he\u2019d done nothing wrong\u2014gave me a lifelong commitment to justice and to the rule of law,\u201d Tribe wrote in an email.</span></p> <p><span>In 1963, one year after graduating from Harvard College, Tribe enrolled in Harvard Law School. Less than a decade later, he had earned tenure at the school, where he would go on to teach future President Barack Obama, Chief Justice John G. Roberts \u201976, Justice Elena Kagan, and Congressman Barney Frank \u201961-\u201962.</span></p> <p><span>Despite his long-held interests in issues of justice, few who knew Tribe as an undergraduate had any idea that he was destined for a career in law. In college, Tribe was a brilliant mathematician, earning summa on his senior thesis. And in his spare time, he was an artist focusing mainly on what he described as \u201cpastel seascapes and portraits and drawings of real nudes.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>THE ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR</b></span></p> <p><span>When Tribe first stepped onto campus as a freshman at the age of 16, he found Harvard to be an eye-opening experience. Neither of his parents had attended college, and, given his humble background, Tribe never attended \u201ca fancy high school,\u201d as he put it.</span></p> <p><span>As a result, the young Tribe was awed by the wide array of new intellectual opportunities he could pursue, as well as \u201call the amazing women I felt too young to be taken seriously by.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have more fond memories than I could possibly recite in a finite period,\u201d Tribe wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Tribe excelled in his academic studies as an undergraduate, friends remembered. He was especially adept at mathematics, enrolling in graduate courses in the department beginning sophomore year.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMind you, he was smarter than practically everyone else we knew in college,\u201d said Stephen M. Jacoby \u201962, who lived with Tribe in Greenough during their freshman year.</span></p> <p><span>Friends who knew Tribe said their talented classmate could have succeeded in a number of post-graduate careers. His only defect, Jacoby pointed out, was his absent-mindedness.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t keep track of his debate cards, of simple things like the raincoat,\u201d Jacoby said. \u201cIt was the epitome of an absent-minded professor, only he was still quite young at the time.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>THE GREAT DEBATER</b></span></p> <p><span>Despite concentrating in mathematics, Tribe sustained his interest in law and public policy issues by joining Harvard\u2019s debate team his freshman year.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cCertainly he\u2019d gotten hooked on some of these big public policy issues,\u201d said David L. Mack \u201962, one of Tribe\u2019s teammates on the debate team.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI give him credit for inventing modern debate,\u201d said Albert W. Alschuler \u201962, a law professor at Northwestern University and Tribe\u2019s sophomore year debate partner.</span></p> <p><span>As the two were walking down Mass. Ave. one day, Tribe spotted a large sketch pad in the window of an art-supply store, Alshuler remembered. Tribe drew a line down the middle of the pad and used both sides keep track of the two arguments in a competition\u2014a practice still used by debaters today.</span></p> <p><span>That year, Alschuler and Tribe made it to the quarterfinals of the national debate tournament. The very next year, Tribe and another classmate  went on to capture the national debate championship.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe [became] one of the top debaters on the college circuit,\u201d Mack said.</span></p> <p><span>But Tribe\u2019s love of public policy issues extended beyond the debate tournament circuit. Jacoby and Mack, who also roomed with Tribe in graduate school, both recalled often staying up late at night in their rooms debating public policy issues with him.</span></p> <p><span><b>A LIBERAL AT HEART</b></span></p> <p><span>After college, Tribe studied mathematics at Harvard for one year on a National Science Foundation fellowship before he suddenly switched fields and enrolled at the Law School.</span></p> <p><span>According to Alschuler, Tribe\u2019s graduate school roommate, it was the brilliance of fellow classmate and future logician Saul A. Kripke \u201962 that convinced Tribe that he could not reach his full potential as a mathematician.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cLarry decided he could never be as good at math as Saul was, but he could easily be as good at law as I was,\u201d Alschuler said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI realized that I wanted to do something with more chance of improving people\u2019s lives and that I really wouldn\u2019t make a major impact in the field [of math],\u201d Tribe explained.</span></p> <p><span>And in his career as a legal scholar, Tribe has achieved this level of great influence, particularly in the field of constitutional law. He has appeared before the Supreme Court 35 times, and his 1978 book \u201cAmerican Constitutional Law\u201d was called \u201cthe closest thing to a definitive treatise\u201d by The New York Times.</span></p> <p><span>In particular, Tribe is renowned for his support of liberal causes. In the 1986 Supreme Court Case Bowers v. Hardwick, Tribe argued for his client against a Georgia anti-sodomy law.</span></p> <p><span>According to Tribe, his firm belief in racial, gender, and sexual equality, as well as economic justice, have not changed throughout his career.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think it has a lot to do with seeing people suffer unjustly as I was growing up,\u201d Tribe wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Mack pointed to a debate trip to the South during their sophomore year as one event that deeply affected Tribe\u2019s commitment to equal rights.</span></p> <p><span>As Tribe traveled to the South for the first time as with his teammates\u2014including Mack and Alschuler\u2014he found himself often using segregated public restrooms and debating at universities that were either still segregated or having trouble adjusting to the recent desegregation of public schools.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAll of us probably started the trip with a liberal view of the race issue, but it is fair to say that we did not feel its emotional weight,\u201d Mack wrote in an email. \u201cThat trip probably helped form Larry\u2019s liberal view on equal rights and opportunity under the law.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Kevin J.

And it showed his impatience for ideas he believed were wrong, a trait that is still clear in his politics.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>One of the most notable fights of Frank\u2019s career\u2014a career which will end when he retires in 2013\u2014has been for gay rights. In 1987 Frank became the first U.S. Congressman to voluntarily announce that he is gay.</span></p> <p><span>In the more than 50 years since that day in the airport, Frank has made a name for himself as not only one of the most effective members of Congress, but also one of the fiercest and most formidable.</span></p> <p><span><b>A LIBERAL ON CAMPUS</b></span></p> <p><span>Frank, who was raised in a working-class household in New Jersey, came to Harvard already a fierce political debater with ardent opinions and an expansive knowledge of politics.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen I first met him, I was struck by his encyclopedic knowledge of American government,\u201d said Charles R. Halpern \u201961, who was Frank\u2019s freshman year roommate. \u201cMore than just facts, he understood how it worked.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Halpern and Frank maintained a strong friendship in college and roomed together until Frank took a semester off in the fall of his junior year.</span></p> <p><span>Frank quickly immersed himself in the political scene at the College. In that circle, Frank \u201cwas perceived as someone who was very interested and knowledgeable about politics,\u201d according to R. Corbin Houchins \u201961, who lived in Frank\u2019s entryway in Matthews in their freshman year.</span></p> <p><span>Frank would often engage in debates with students who held more conservative beliefs, including his roommate, Wyman.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe and I used to argue all the time,\u201d Wyman said. \u201cBut it was not out of anger, it was out of an interest in the topics.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>James W. Segel \u201967, who later went on to serve as an adviser to Frank, first met the congressman when Frank was serving as a government tutor in Winthrop House, and Segel decided he was someone worth knowing.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe would sit with a big cigar and talk about politics,\u201d Segel said. \u201cThe good thing was he took people seriously. He didn\u2019t treat them as anything but serious, and he\u2019d argue [with them]....

A recent series of studies conducted by Harvard neuroscientist and Associate Professor Jason P.

That's right, we may think we're all great listeners, but we're really spending almost half of our time talking about our opinions on a subject or a telling a story in which we are the protagonist. Mitchell and Tamir conducted a series of five studies in order to determine why we love conversing about ourselves above all other topics.</span></p> <p><span>The studies revealed that we will often go to comic lengths to avoid talking about others and to keep the focus of the conversation on ourselves. In some of their tests, Mitchell and Tamir even offered participants money to talk about other people, such as President Obama. Financial incentives, however, did not prove powerful enough to prevent people from revealing personal information, such as whether or not they liked pizza.</span></p> <p><span>The neuroscientists monitored the brain activity of some participants and observed that when these participants talked about themselves there was increased activity in the mesolimbic dopamine system, the same area of the brain that experiences increased activity during sex.</span></p> <p><span>Apparently, long-winded stories about your last trip to the Delphic can be just as enjoyable as how that night might have ended.

{"title": "At HLS, Kennedy Finds His Platform | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Sorting through the details of a foreclosure case, Joseph P. Kennedy III sat in a small room of the Rental Housing Resource Center near City Hall in Downtown Boston. Kennedy, fellow Harvard Law School student Nicholas J. Hartigan, and a third-party mediator were working through a standard pre-trial mediation on behalf of a client being sued for eviction.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou know, you really look an awful lot like that guy,\u201d the mediator mused as the conversation came to a lull, Hartigan recalls. He put his head down and tried to suppress a laugh. Kennedy looked at the table, letting the statement fall unanswered.</span></p> <p><span>The comment was entirely innocent, Hartigan says, but Kennedy did resemble the man in the photograph. It was his grandfather, Robert F. Kennedy \u201948, the former U.S. Attorney General.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy and Hartigan were members of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, one of the Law School\u2019s student-run nonprofit legal services organizations. Not yet accredited attorneys but much more than casual volunteers, they dedicated much of their law school years to representing low-income, often immigrant, clients in the Boston area.</span></p> <p><span>For Kennedy, the heir to a political dynasty stretching back generations, his work at the Bureau was more than just a box to check in the field of public service or a duty to his family\u2019s reputation, friends say.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s no obligation for a kid at Harvard Law School to spend a bunch of time in Dorchester,\u201d Hartigan says. \u201cIt\u2019s just stuff he made a conscious effort to do, really for the sole purpose that it\u2019s what he wanted to do.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Less than three years after graduating from the Law School, the 31-year-old Kennedy announced he would enter the race for the seat being vacated by longtime Congressman Barney Frank \u201961-\u201962 in Massachusetts Fourth Congressional District.</span></p> <p><span>In January, he left the Middlesex Country prosecutor\u2019s office and quickly assumed his place at the front of the field. Early polling has shown Kennedy with as much as a two-to-one lead over his chief Republican rival Sean Bielat.</span></p> <p><span>As polls and fundraising scorecards have shown, Kennedy will have every advantage his family\u2019s name and connections can bring him.</span></p> <p><span>But according to those who knew him at the Law School, Kennedy\u2019s career there\u2014which may fit nicely into his family\u2019s tradition of public service\u2014was uniquely his own.</span></p> <p><span><b>A BUSY MAN</b></span></p> <p><span>Kennedy was one of about 25 students accepted to join the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau at the end of his first year, and it soon became his defining experience at the Law School.</span></p> <p><span>The Bureau\u2014affectionately called \u201cHLAB\u201d\u2014is the oldest and most reputable student-run clinic at the Law School which aims to give legal representation to marginalized groups that could otherwise not afford it.</span></p> <p><span>Students like Kennedy enter the Bureau with little to no legal experience and are almost immediately put to work representing clients of their own. Basically, Hartigan explains, the first weeks at the Bureau are a crash course. Ultimately students testify in court, raise cases, meet with clients, and even represent their clients in trial.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was one of the first opportunities I actually had to practice the law,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cTo see how the law actually affects people on an individual level, many of whom were the people who the law was designed to protect.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>At the Bureau, Kennedy quickly assumed a leadership position, being elected to the clinic\u2019s board as the outreach director. When Hartigan and fellow Bureau member David E. Haller \u201903 decided to start a special foreclosure task force in 2008, they looked to Kennedy to help facilitate the launch of the unprecedented initiative which would add even more work to the already over-burdened Bureau staff.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe first person that I went to when we were trying to do this was Joe. I knew that Joe was the type of person who would work his butt off,\u201d Hartigan says. \u201cIt was the kind of thing where if we had him on our side we had a lot better shot.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>With Kennedy\u2019s help, Hartigan and Haller aimed to visit every foreclosed property in Boston, bringing on more clients than the Bureau had dealt with before.</span></p> <p><span>The initiative, No One Leaves, found most of its cases in Dorchester and South Boston where owners of triple-decker homes often rent out upstairs apartments. As the financial and housing crises swept across the country, more and more of these homeowners slipped into foreclosure, and renters were left in the cold\u2014at which point Hartigan, Kennedy, and other staffers would arrive.</span></p> <p><span>Even without the extra work of task forces like No One Leaves, HLAB is intense. If accepted, students must commit to two years of service. Officially, members will work about 20 hours a week, says Boston lawyer Elizabeth Nessen, Kennedy\u2019s former advisor at the Bureau. But according to former bureau members, 20 hours is the bare minimum, and most students would often push 30- or 40-hour weeks.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI spent every day with Joe...from the minute the sun rose to after it set. The bureau is a really insane time commitment,\u201d says one of Kennedy\u2019s Law School classmates, who requested to remain anonymous as her job prohibits her from speaking with the media.</span></p> <p><span>As one of the few fluent Spanish speakers at HLAB, Kennedy was always on call. Hartigan and others would often summon him from class to translate, and Kennedy, dropping everything, would get in his pick-up truck and drive wherever he was needed.</span></p> <p><span>The overflow of work at the Bureau made keeping up with classes and other activities a battle.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think the word balance is just a level of control that we probably didn\u2019t have,\u201d Hartigan explains with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of triage.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But HLAB was not the only claim on Kennedy\u2019s time. He also served as the technical editor for The Harvard Human Rights Journal, responsible for checking references and citations for each article before it was printed. In the spring of 2007, Kennedy co-cooridanated the journal\u2019s 20th anniversary conference.</span></p> <p><span>Off-campus, Kennedy helped found an after-school education and outreach program in Jamaica Plain with his future fianc\u00e9e and fellow HLS student Lauren A. Birchfield. And during the lead up to the 2008 presidential election, he traveled the country as a translator for his uncle Edward M. Kennedy \u201954-\u201956, who was campaigning on behalf of then-Senator Barack Obama.</span></p> <p><span>In the classroom, Kennedy was a solid student, former classmates said, though worn a little thin by his extra-curricular activities. During his three years at the Law School, he twice took courses taught by Law School professor and current U.S. Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren, and worked closely with Professor Lucie E. White on human rights and poverty issues.</span></p> <p><span><b>A FAMILY LEGACY</b></span></p> <p><span>Kennedy\u2019s enrollment in Harvard Law School in 2006 was in more than one way a return home. When his parents, Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II and Sheila Brewster Rauch, divorced in 1991, Kennedy came to live exclusively in Cambridge; until that point he had split his time between Cambridge and Kennedy property in Hyannis, Mass.</span></p> <p><span>With his twin brother Matthew R. Kennedy, Kennedy attended Buckingham, Browne, and Nichols, a private preparatory school in Cambridge, and then Stanford. After graduating, Kennedy spent two years in the Dominican Republic as a Peace Corps volunteer\u2014a watershed experience he has often pointed to as a candidate.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy returned home from abroad in 2006, honored, he says, to have been admitted to Harvard Law School, a campus steeped in ancestral legacy.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, for all his striking resemblances to iconic family members\u2014the shock of red hair, slightly untamed, the sharp facial features, freckled with an Irish complexion, the wide convincing gait\u2014Kennedy\u2019s time at Harvard was shaped by his own interests more so than a familial legacy.</span></p> <p><span>A number of Kennedy\u2019s closest friends from law school said it took them months to realize just who the laid-back Kennedy really was.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAs far as I knew, he was just a guy who played college lacrosse, and we were having a lot of fun working together,\u201d Hartigan says.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s about as normal as it gets,\u201d says Kennedy\u2019s classmate who requested anonymity. \u201cHe\u2019s a very dressed-down type when he\u2019s in his element.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy was just as unassuming with his clients, Bureau colleagues say, never going out of his way to mention his last name or allude to his family.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat was just his way,\u201d Nessen says.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny about it is, Joe could very well be trumpeting who he is and where he comes from\u2014and he\u2019s got every right\u2014but he just never, never talks about it,\u201d Kennedy\u2019s classmate says. \u201cIt\u2019s not because he\u2019s secretive, but it\u2019s because he\u2019s built his whole life on standing on his own two feet.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>\u201cUNCHARACTERISTIC OF HIM\u201d</b></span></p> <p><span>For a Kennedy, politics is the perpetual elephant in the room, but the young Congressional candidate says he had no intention of running for public office when he arrived at Harvard Law School.</span></p> <p><span>Those who worked with him at the Legal Aid Bureau or the Human Rights Journal agree that Kennedy did not have overt political ambitions, even if the work he was doing provided a recognizable political foundation.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe has this commitment to public service, but he wasn\u2019t the person in my group that I thought was going to run for office,\u201d Nessen says. \u201cIt\u2019s actually uncharacteristic of him.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But by the time he graduated from the Law School, Kennedy\u2019s stance had changed. Though he had always been committed to public service, public office seemed an increasingly likely option for the young graduate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about running for public office when I got here,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cI think the experience of learning what the law can do to set the structures for society and then what you can do to change that...definitely led to my decision to eventually run.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Even if they would not have expected it, friends say they are not surprised Kennedy is running. His focus on public service and social justice at the Law School, they say, laid the groundwork for either of two careers: law or poltics.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t something we talked about, but it\u2019s not at all different from the type of community work we did when I knew him,\u201d Hartigan says. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve done with him has been dealing with people and doing things to be active in the community, and I think in the better sense of what they do, that is what politicians do.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFrom a pure, personality perspective, this is somebody who in pretty much every respect is built for [pubic office] in ways more than he even knows,\u201d his classmate says.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Nicholas P.

However, Goodman also said that the source of the funds for these subdsidized loans must be taken into account. Maintaining lower interest rates could take funds away from programs that assist lower-income students and, with the exception of institutions that have generous financial aid programs, there are relatively few other options available to help these students pay for college.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard is unusual in that it has this remarkable set of resources so that for very low income students a Harvard education is relatively inexpensive,\u201d Goodman said.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy School Professor Christopher N. Avery \u201988 said that despite increased interest rates, families will opt to bear additional financial burdens because it is worthwhile for most people to attend college.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you don\u2019t go to college especially in these job markets prospects are really bleak, much bleaker without a college degree than with one,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>However, Obama said in difficult economic times, small increases in debt can feel like a great burden for many American families.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe central issue here is that if these were normal economic times, you would expect people to pay market rates on these loans,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cBut these are not normal times,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Goodman suggested that a potential alternative would be to have income level determine the interest rate that students would have to pay.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSo if you had a job we should expect you to pay a higher interest rate on this loan, if you didn\u2019t we would forgive you and give you the lower one,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Alternatively, he said, Congress could gradually raise interest rates.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Elizabeth S.

{"title": "Keep Student Loan Interest Rates Low | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Fifty years ago college was a luxury. Back then, you could still graduate from high school and get a good paying job that would guarantee you a place in the middle class. Those days are gone.</span></p> <p><span>A postsecondary education is the ticket to economic success in America. We know that the jobs of the future\u00a0will\u00a0all require some kind of education or training after high school.</span></p> <p><span>And while it\u2019s never been more important to have a degree, a certificate or an industry recognized credential\u2014it\u2019s also never been more expensive.</span></p> <p><span>Since 1995, college costs across the country have risen almost five times faster than median household income. As a result, students and their families are taking on more and more debt. Borrowing to pay for college used to be the exception; now it\u2019s the rule.</span></p> <p><span>Next month, millions of America\u2019s newest college graduates\u00a0will\u00a0leave school to enter the job market. As they do, a new challenge awaits many of them: how to pay back the student debt they\u2019ve accumulated over the last four years.</span></p> <p><span>Two-thirds of students are borrowing to get their degree, and they\u2019re graduating with more than $26,000 in debt. In an economy still recovering from the worst downturn since the Great Depression, paying off a sum that large can be a daunting.</span></p> <p><span>To make matters worse, a policy change is coming that\u00a0will\u00a0make getting out of debt more expensive for over 7 million young Americans: Without Congressional action, the interest rate on subsidized Stafford loans is set to double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent starting July 1, 2012.</span></p> <p><span>Based on the average loan amount, doubling the subsidized Stafford loan interest rate\u00a0will\u00a0add more than $1,000 in total costs.\u00a0 For students who borrow heavily to go to college, it could cost even more. Only Congress can keep these interest rates from doubling.</span></p> <p><span>Last week, President Obama traveled to universities across the country to call on Congress do its part to keep college affordable by stopping student loan interest rates from doubling this July. With so many students struggling to both make ends meet and afford the skyrocketing price of a college degree, now is not the right time to heap more costs on top of them.</span></p> <p><span>As we work to get the economy back on track, no one is suggesting it would be a good idea to double interest rates on credit cards or home mortgages. Why then do some believe it\u2019s a good idea to double interest rates for students?</span></p> <p><span>We all have a role to play\u2014the President, Congress, parents, students and schools\u2014in making college affordable and keeping the middle class dream alive. Our administration is continuing to do its part: Despite being in one of the most challenging budget environments in history and cutting almost all-domestic spending across the board, President Obama is increasing the investment in higher education.</span></p> <p><span>The Obama Administration is providing billions of dollars a year in aid to needy students through Pell grants and helping students to better manage their debt after graduation with programs like income-based repayment and public service loan forgiveness. The President is also proposing a number of initiatives that would continue to make college more affordable, including doubling the number of work-study jobs within five years; making the American Opportunity Tax Credit permanent; and providing new incentives for states and institutions to keep college costs from escalating.</span></p> <p><span>President Obama cannot\u2014and should not\u2014do this work alone. In 2007, a bipartisan majority in a Democrat-controlled Congress and a Republican president came together to lower interest rates on these loans because it was the right thing to do. This is not about politics. It\u2019s about doing right for America\u2019s students\u2014and for our nation\u2019s economy.</span></p> <p><span>Now Congress has an important decision to make. Do they double interest rates for Stafford loans, adding more debt to students already struggling to make ends meet? Or do they invest in the future by helping to keep interest rates where they are? For me, the choice is clear. We have to educate our way to a better economy. And as President Obama has stepped up to meet the challenge, I hope leaders in Congress\u00a0will\u00a0step up as well.</span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span><i>Arne S.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Jon Huntsman, Jr. walked into the Center for Public Leadership at the Kennedy School two weeks ago with the confidant stride of a former presidential candidate. He had been invited to make a short speech and field questions from students, the kind of intimate event which would have been prohibitively low-profile just a few months ago.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m a little perplexed,\u201d Huntsman told a crowd of aspiring politicos. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why you want to hear from a failed candidate?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Huntsman wore a well-cut navy suit, a white French-cuffed shirt, and a slender purple tie, his cuffs linked by two small red stones bordered with Chinese characters. If international statesmanship had a cover boy, it would certainly be Huntsman.</span></p> <p><span>But on this occasion, the former State Department journeyman seemed more content being a has-been than the leading man. Occasionally savoring an expletive off-limits on the campaign trail, Huntsman offered up \u201crandom musings, if you will\u201d of lessons learned in his various offices and campaigns through his over 25 years in politics.</span></p> <p><span>On China\u2019s political future: \u201cHow would you like to have six hundred million redundant farmers on your hands?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>On America\u2019s aging infrastructure: \u201cIn politics, to utter the word \u2018infrastructure\u2019 will get you in trouble in some groups.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>On the presidential candidates: \u201cThe barriers to enter this game are pretty darn low. We\u2019re a country of 315 million people...and this is the best we can do?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Jokes aside, most of the hour-long talk was spent lamenting the lack of leadership in the Republican Party and throughout the capital. Before long, Huntsman removes his jacket and leans in toward the crowd.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe party is not in a good place right now,\u201d he said, pointing to candidates afraid to take bold stances and others afraid just to enter the race as evidence. Voters are getting fed up, he explained, and sooner or later they are going to do something about it.</span></p> <p><span>It was not the first time Huntsman has been outspoken in his criticism of political leadership since calling it quits on his own campaign in January. He appeared on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe in February, telling host Joe Scarborough the GOP would probably be best served by a third-party movement. The statement rippled through the media and died out. (It\u2019s hard for former candidates to make the news during primary season.) But Huntsman\u2019s message is not likely to go away.</span></p> <p><span>Case in point: likely Republican nominee Mitt Romney. After a half-decade long presidential campaign, the former Massachusetts governor finally appears to have secured himself a spot in the country\u2019s biggest political showdown, but the stadium looks to be empty.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think Romney will show leadership on the economic deficit,\u201d Huntsman said. \u201cOn the trust deficit, I don\u2019t see a whole lot of leadership.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Outside of the party bosses, Republicans around the country just don\u2019t seem to care for Romney. That there are party die-hards more excited about the prospect of Jeb 2016 than Willard 2012 says a lot. Huntsman says it\u2019s all about leadership. Voters don\u2019t believe in Romney. Years as a campaigner have worn away his novelty and more importantly the clarity of his message.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe people, they want to be told where you want to go,\u201d Huntsman said. \u201cThey\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt so long as we tell them upfront what we want to do...where we want to go.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Things seem to be so bad in Huntsman\u2019s view, that nothing short of a popular uprising will set the leadership straight. The leaders need to be led.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy source of hope is that the American people, while sometimes late to the game, will demand change eventually,\u201d Huntsman said.</span></p> <p><span>The speech at Harvard was a last-minute affair tucked into a day jam-packed with appearances and private events. Despite the strong-handling of staff and his wife Mary Kaye\u2019s bored looks, the politician couldn\u2019t help shaking a few hands and posing for pictures. Even as he walked to the Harvard Square Hotel, Huntsman stopped periodically in an open plaza to chat with students trailing him.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSo, what do you study?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Talking with Scarborough, Huntsman made it clear he was not the man for the job. He says he would be crazy to run for president again. Still, the emphasis with which he dismissed questions of a potential run in 2016 seemed almost too convincing, drawing knowing smiles from much of the Harvard crowd.\u00a0Flanked by Mary Kaye, his campaign-trail shadow, post-candidate Huntsman affects a very contradictory air\u2014an air that may be best described as, well, political.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI never thought I\u2019d run for public office. I used to make fun of people who ran for public office,\u201d Huntsman joked with the crowd, his humor walking a fine line.</span></p> <p><span>Huntsman may not be a candidate, but he\u2019s not exactly off the trail.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Good Answer, Mr. President | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When I was twelve years old, I developed a crush on a boy who was in a number of my classes.</span></p> <p><span>At the time, I was a sixth-grader in the Deep South whose family had recently moved across the county into a new school district. \u00a0It felt like we had moved across the country. \u00a0At the smaller elementary school I had left, Umbro and Nike shorts were popular, but in this new junior high school, khaki shorts, Birkenstocks, and polo shirts were prerequisites for coolness. \u00a0The boy I noticed fit this fashion to a T.</span></p> <p><span>I believed without reservation the crush I was developing was wrong. \u00a0I loved church, and I had an understanding that, if you were a boy, liking other boys was a very bad thing to do. \u00a0I had no doubt that I was in the wrong, and I prayed every night\u2014literally\u2014that the feelings would go away. \u00a0And, eventually, they did. \u00a0I breathed a deep sigh of relief. \u00a0I felt as if I\u2019d dodged a bullet, with God\u2019s help. \u00a0From that point, I went on having crushes on girls as I had until that point, and I\u2019ve gone on having crushes on girls since.</span></p> <p><span>But many other kids weren\u2019t so lucky.\u00a0Their \u201cillicit\u201d crushes kept on coming. Several kids in my school endured years of bullying and teasing because they were gay or appeared to be gay, and many times I stood idly by, doing nothing to stop it. Even today, their faces, usually with angry expressions, come to my mind.\u00a0Back then, I believed homosexuality was a sin, but I also knew it was wrong for kids to be bullied like they were.\u00a0I remember thinking that the bullying, as terrible as it was, was an unfortunate result of sinful behavior, equating it with the Fall of Man since the Garden of Eden.\u00a0And, after all, I thought, if I\u2019d prayed and gotten over my crush, why couldn\u2019t they?</span></p> <p><span>Several years later, when I visited Harvard for the first time, my views on the matter were \u201cevolving.\u201d \u00a0It was a sunny spring day in 2004, and I was dragging around my mother and grandmother, along with all our heavy suitcases and Southern accents.\u00a0The first thing I saw when I came up out of the Red Line at Johnston Gate was a huge, white banner across the street, hanging from the edifice of First Parish Cambridge.\u00a0It read, in all capitals, \u201cWE SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE.\u201d The banner blew in the breeze, and the sunlight brightened it so one needed to squint to see it.</span></p> <p><span>I was stunned to see this banner, and, somewhat to my surprise, I was also overjoyed.\u00a0It had been one thing in the past to observe gay pride parades in all of their dramatic and colorful energy; it was quite another to see this declarative, bold statement draped from a church building, in the public square, in plain view.</span></p> <p><span>I was a high schooler, and this very issue had been weighing on my mind for some time.\u00a0I was reading a book by the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes, who was Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Minister of the Memorial Church until his passing last spring. The book, called \u201cThe Good Book,\u201d recounts in part Rev. Gomes\u2019 experience revealing himself in 1991 to be what many have called a contradiction: a gay, African American, Baptist minister.\u00a0He had become minister in 1974, and his book was in my backpack that day thirty years later. The banner at the First Parish Church filled me with sheer joy that something good was happening, something I could not have imagined just a few years back when the thought I might be gay was terrifying to me.</span></p> <p><span>Politically, the particulars of my views on the issue have continued to \u201cevolve\u201d since then: Ideally, I think only civil unions should be granted by the government while churches take care of the \u201cmarriages\u201d; I think the \u201cdefense of marriage\u201d advocates are right when they say marriage is traditionally a religious institution between one man and one woman; I think churches should handle explicitly religious institutions, while the state grants contracts that guarantee hospital visits, joint taxes, etc.</span></p> <p><span>But it was not until Wednesday, when President Barack Obama became the first sitting President of the United States to express full support for same-sex marriage, that I felt again that same stunned joy I\u2019d felt back in 2004.\u00a0Obama\u2019s unprecedented announcement is an unequivocal victory for civil rights and equality, and I believe fewer kids will be bullied and teased because of it.</span></p> <p><span>I don\u2019t know whether Obama and Gomes crossed paths when they were at Harvard in the early 1990s. ButI wish Gomes were still here with us today to offer his thoughts on Obama\u2019s newfound support for gay marriage.\u00a0When I first heard the news, I could hear Rev. Gomes\u2019 voice begin to echo in my head. In his old Religion 42 course, Rev. Gomes once said, \u201cThere are no bad questions. There are some very bad answers.\u201d Of Obama\u2019s reply to the ABC News interviewer\u2019s question on Wednesday, I believe Gomes would have raised his eyebrows in restrained surprised, nodded his head, and called it, in his beautiful manner of speaking, a very good answer.</span></p> <p><span><i>Seth A.

But for me, this announcement was the logical conclusion not to Vice President Biden\u2019s admirable if imprudent admission on Sunday, but to the letters and journals that have emerged in the past two weeks that have given extraordinary insight into the man who candidly spoke to ABC this week.</span></p> <p><span>David Maraniss is a very good biographer, so it should come as no surprise that he has dug up some fascinating material about President Obama for his upcoming book Barack Obama: The Story<i>, </i>excerpted in the June edition of Vanity Fair. The article, entitled \u201c<a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/06/young-barack-obama-in-love-david-maraniss\">Becoming Obama</a>,\u201d treats what has been a hitherto overlooked interval in the lifeof the forty-second President, his time in New York after graduating from Columbia in 1983.Maraniss\u2019s descriptions are both intimate, giving us an Obama who would \u201clounge around, drinking coffee and solving the New York Timescrossword puzzle, bare-chested, wearing a blue and white sarong,\u201d and relatively profound, as when Obama explains in an interview \u201cThe only way my life makes sense is if, regardless of culture, race, religion, tribe, there is this commonality\u2026So that is at the core of who I am.\u201d In some ways, Obama\u2019s attempt to turn his life into a story, best exemplified in his superb autobiography Dreams from My Father, is part of the job of all aspirants to high office.Every politician strives to create a narrative that explains their rise to prominence and fills out their character in such a way that the office they seek to occupy seems like an inevitable next step, something that follows consequently from the trajectory that brought them before the electorate.</span></p> <p><span>But the Obama we meet in Maraniss\u2019s account is someone much different, and much more interesting; the protagonist of a real bildungsromanwho struggles to define himself, both in isolation and in relation to his white girlfriends, Pakistani friends, and multi-textured familial background. Obama describes his predicament as one where he felt \u201ccaught without a class, a structure or tradition to support me.\u201d These lacunae where we might expect to find the primary markers of identity spurred not alienation, but an intense search for integration, \u201cThe only way to assuage my feelings of isolation are to absorb all the traditions (and) classes; make them mine, me theirs.\u201d Before he could organize communities, Obama had to organize the confusing fragments of identity that were his inheritance, but also his opportunity. The young man we see in these pages doesn\u2019t have any definitive answers, but his awareness of the centrality of this task of self-fashioning is boldly apparent.</span></p> <p><span>His letters to one of his girlfriends Alex McNair, and the journals of a second, Genevieve Cook, portray a man who, even when he \u201csat on the edge of the bed\u2014dressed\u2014 blue jeans and luscious ladies on his chest, the end of the front section of the Sunday Times in his hand,\u201d is readily recognizable. Cook laments how Obama \u201cbides his time\u201d and draws \u201cothers\u2019 cards out of their hands for careful inspection\u2014without giving too much of your own away.\u201d This might be a young man who kept a cool distance that his girlfriend found frustrating, but it also might be the President Obama who passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with the slimmest of votes or who continues to teach us about a kind of progressivism that happens slowly\u2014but meaningfully and irrevocably.</span></p> <p><span>Maraniss describes a young man searching for purpose, pontificating on Modernist poetics and falling in and out of love with a couple of thoughtful, beautiful young women. His analysis of T.S. Eliot is both insightful and revealing; \u201cRemember how I said there\u2019s a certain type of conservatism which I respect more than bourgeois liberalism\u2014Eliot is of this type.\u201d What is striking about these snippets of the young Obama is how prosaic they are on the one hand and how utterly revealing on the other. Obama continues to model a kind of liberalism that is temperamentally conservative, that sees change as most effective when it is processed through a mind that can capaciously not only understand the other side, but alsoinhabit opposing view points.</span></p> <p><span>In an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/opinion/young-obama-an-eliot-conservative.html\">editorial </a>in The New York Times, the poet and literary critic Adam Kirsch \u201897 lauds \u201cMr. Obama\u2019s ability to recognize the poetic truth of Eliot\u2019s conservatism, while still embracing the practical truth of liberalism.\u201d Both recognition and embrace happened in and through writing, and much of it in the crucible of passionate romantic relationships that refracted both selves through a kind of dual lens. Obama teaches us to recognize everything about ourselves and other people, and through that recognition we will learn which causes and people deserve our embrace. As we recognize the extraordinary man who is our President, we should never forget when he was our age, in his girlfriend\u2019s apartment, smoking a cigarette in pajamas, musing on Eliot. This, more than anything else, is the portrait of the President as a young man.</span></p> <p><span><i>Ari R. Hoffman \u201910 is a Ph.D. candidate in English.</i></span></p>"}

Then, on Tuesday, North Carolina <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/north-carolina-passes-gay-marriage-ban-amendment-one/2012/05/08/gIQAHYpfBU_blog.html\">passed</a> a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages as well as civil unions. Suddenly, President Obama\u2019s dissimulation on marriage equality seemed both absurd and harmful. No doubt knowing he could delay the issue no longer, President Obama arranged an interview on ABC in which he <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2012/05/09/gIQAivsWDU_story.html\">affirmed</a> his support for same-sex marriage.</span></p> <p><span>Although it is terribly unfortunate that the president ever chose to feign opposition to marriage equality, it is nevertheless extremely heartening that, as of Wednesday, the president of the United States of America, for the first time in history, supports true equality for gay Americans. This also provides voters with a starker choice in November\u2019s election, considering that Mitt Romney has reaffirmed his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/us/politics/romney-reaffirms-opposition-to-marriage-or-similar-for-gay-couples.html\">opposition</a> to same-sex marriage and allegedly <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romneys-prep-school-classmates-recall-pranks-but-also-troubling-incidents/2012/05/10/gIQA3WOKFU_story.html\">bullied</a>a classmate, whom he suspected of being gay, in high school.</span></p> <p><span>Despite occasional setbacks like what occurred in North Carolina on Tuesday, it is clear that the direction of cultural shift is toward marriage equality in America. The most recent Gallup poll on the subject <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/147662/first-time-majority-americans-favor-legal-gay-marriage.aspx\">shows</a> that seventy percent of 18-34 year-olds think gay marriage should be legal, while fifty-three percent of 35-54 year olds support marriage equality as well. These numbers are growing and ought to give hope and comfort to all those who care about equality for all. Now that we have a president who supports marriage equality, it is just a matter of time before the winds of change overcome the inertia of baseless stigma and irrational hatred.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Our Etch A Sketch Moment | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Crafting a successful simile is an immensely satisfying experience. It is one of the real pleasures of language\u2014marrying together likeness while also scintillating with the risk of difference. To hazard one myself, it is one of the preeminent gambles we can take with words, because it requires daring, a dash of bravado, and a sympathetic ear. One might think that Erik Fehrnstrom, a senior advisor to Mitt Romney\u2019s Presidential campaign, won the jackpot when he <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/03/romney-could-use-etch-a-sketch-restart-with-latinos-women-the-poor/\">compared</a> his boss\u2019s transition to the upcoming general election campaign to a certain toy: \u201cEverything changes. It\u2019s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.\u201d Fehrnstrom\u2019s delivery is flawless; the statement of a general truth about universal change, the leap into simile, with the hedging qualification \u201calmost\u201d (poets are not yet, alas, the legislators of the world), and then the glossing of that simile, just in case our memories of Etch A Sketches are appropriately muddled. It is, without a doubt, the Simile of the Year. But when then was it greeted with more consternation than approbation by Team Romney?</span></p> <p><span>Explicating a simile is almost as bad as explaining a joke, as both suffer rather than thrive under the microscope. But the image of the Etch A Sketch, with its interlocking resonances of writing and erasure, composition and blankness, is a plastic and aluminum (no, not sand) aperture into the consistently bedeviling problem of constancy in our politics. We demand unwavering conviction, but reality requires flexibility. Principles and pragmatism dance uneasily, with the former aspiring to the flexibility of the latter, and the second striving for the rectitude of the first.</span></p> <p><span>As with so much else about our country, Ralph Waldo Emerson articulated a truth about us early on; \u201ca foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.\u201d This certainly seems to be true in our politics, although Emerson most likely did not foresee the tribulations of his fellow Massachusite John F. Kerry, who was crucified on a windsurfing board and blown adrift by the winds of pro and con votes on the very same issues. But Lyndon B. Johnson, in his persistence in pursuing the war in Vietnam, would have done well to recall Emerson\u2019s advice, and many of us would have liked to etch our own actions with erasable ink, turning the dial to obscure immature opinions, poorly constructed arguments, and intemperate ripostes.</span></p> <p><span>Certainly, no one would like to more than Mitt Romney. A conservative persona punctured by such lacunae in orthodoxy as pro-choice positions and universal healthcare is especially vulnerable to the awkward edges of a palimpsestic personal history. So far, he has avoided the dogmatic bonfires of so many primary Savanarolas. But shape-shifting has its prices, especially if Obama, like Hercules, can get ahold of this ideological Proteus.</span></p> <p><span>But turn the knob on your mental Etch A Sketch and return to our original contention that every simile is a risk, an essaying of the delicate balance between likeness and difference. The beauty of the Etch A Sketch is that it allows for risks; impermanence can be midwife to invention. Static sincerity tends to be imaginatively poor and stylistically stunted. People are interesting because they change, and notice themselves changing, and chart the courses of these micro-evolutions. Oftentimes, the call for pragmatism and compromise in politics is indicative of a kind of flabby impulse toward moderation, a lazy splitting of the difference. Romney\u2019s late career reinvention strains all manner of credulity, as one\u2019s political convictions often undergo renovations earlier in life. But still, we should be equally skeptical at claims to steadfastness.</span></p> <p><span>The best kinds of leaders consistently admit their own inconsistency and remain certain about ends, even as they experiment with means. The Etch A Sketch, invented in 1960, was the perfect medium for a decade that erased so much of what came before and re-jumbled a whole host of relations, a decade where sex and family and politics all became breathtakingly and thrillingly erasable. Our age is still thinking about new ways to order all of the writing we do, all of the record we generate. As we grow into a world we have entirely inscribed, how we erase will become a question every bit as urgent as how we write.</span></p> <p><span><i>Ari R.

{"title": "Standing Up For AIDS | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>At the most crucial moment to bring an end to the worst epidemic in recent history, President Obama has failed. Over 33 million people around the world live with HIV or AIDS and more than half of the individuals who could benefit from treatment lack access to HIV/AIDS medications. Furthermore, there have been major breakthroughs in the science of HIV prevention and treatment in the past two years. A number of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of treatment to prevent transmission, specifically the ability of pre-exposure prophylaxis to eliminate infection, and the cost effectiveness of investing now so that spending on treatment can begin to drop in just three years.\u00a0The volume and persuasiveness of all of this evidence led many, including Secretary Clinton and President Obama, to declare that <a href=\"http://www.c2ea.org/news/detail/hillary-clinton-end-of-aids-is-now-u.s.-government-policy\">the end of the epidemic is in sight</a>. Last December, on World AIDS Day, AIDS activists applauded President Obama\u2019s announcement that he would increase the U.S. treatment target from 4 million people to 6 million by 2013 as he declared his commitment to an <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-collins/obama-pepfar_b_1253341.html\">AIDS free generation.</a></span></p> <p><span>But AIDS activists, and the millions who are affected by the disease around the world, were soon met with disappointment. The President\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget proposed a cut of <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8Yem7yolTs4J:www.amfar.org/uploadedFiles/_amfarorg/In_The_Community/FY13-HumanImpact-IB.pdf.doc+&amp;cd=4&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us\">$562.9 million</a> in bilateral HIV/AIDS spending through the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, slashing the program\u2019s budget by 12.3 percent. This is not the first time that advocates have been disappointed with the President on this issue. In 2007, Obama (then a candidate) promised to increase AIDS funding every year he was in office, to a total of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/83/provide-50-billion-by-2013-for-the-global-fight-a/\">$50 billion</a> over five years by 2013. But in the years he has been in office, funding for these programs has flat lined. His most recent proposal to cut AIDS funding represents an abandonment of the fight against the AIDS epidemic.\u00a0PEPFAR has been incredibly effective in providing treatment to millions of people, and the President\u2019s failure to sustain funding levels for this program signifies a betrayal to the millions who need treatment but still lack access to essential medicine. These steep cuts may even mean that funding to continue treatment for individuals currently receiving medication will dry up.\u00a0Furthermore, these cuts will likely lead to highly increased mortality due to AIDS within the next year, an increase in vertical HIV transmission (from mother-to-child), as well as an increase in the number of children orphaned due to the disease. At this crucial moment when we are finally becoming capable of treating those currently afflicted with HIV/AIDS and bringing an end to the epidemic in sight, President Obama has given up.</span></p> <p><span>The void in political will from the executive branch has sadly been met with silence from Massachusetts\u2019 legislative delegation, contributing to the stagnating progress in fighting the AIDS epidemic. The outpouring of global health research and information from within Massachusetts has situated the state as a leading locus of knowledge and work in this field. However, it does not seem that this focus has been reflected in the priorities of our legislators. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Senator John Kerry (D-MA) has had the opportunity to leverage his influential position to be a true advocate for AIDS funding. In recent years, though his private voice has supposedly been strong on this issue, his public voice has been virtually nonexistent. \u00a0Senator Kerry\u2019s annual statement on World AIDS Day has become an empty tradition\u2014supported by the best of intentions, but reinforced by no concrete action to ensure the expansion of AIDS treatment and prevention measures to those who need it most.\u00a0\u00a0As the Obama administration has continually flat-lined or slashed bilateral AIDS funding, Senator Kerry has neglected to sign on to two recent \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letters in the Senate\u2014one submitted in\u00a02009\u00a0and one submitted in\u00a02010\u2014calling for the restoration of funding levels. In recent meetings with members of Senator Kerry\u2019s policy team, we have been assured of Kerry\u2019s private leadership on the issues, but now is the time for urgent, committed, and public leadership. With the end of the AIDS pandemic in sight, Senator Kerry must find his voice again.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the failures of two would-be leaders in the fight against AIDS, there is still hope that positive political action might emanate from this Commonwealth. Senator Scott Brown (R-MA), who fashions himself a maverick, has the perfect opportunity to step up and fill the void left by President Obama and Senator Kerry. He can reclaim the Republican legacy for PEPFAR, which was founded in 2003 by President George W. Bush. In the coming weeks, the Senate Appropriations Committee will work on a fiscal year 2013 budget. Now is the time for Senator Brown to bring attention to the need for the U.S. to continue its commitment to ending AIDS, just as he has done for issues regarding human<a href=\"http://www.scottbrown.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news?ID=c194fa8d-f741-44c2-a065-08e98dfd9400\"> trafficking</a>. There are myriad reasons for Senator Brown to use his voice to renew the U.S. fight against AIDS, not least of which is the fact that millions of lives are on the line.</span></p> <p><span><i>Lily H.

Not only has he earned more degrees than Barack Obama from Harvard, but, if he becomes president, he would be the most crimson commander-in-chief since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, class of 1902. Romney has not one, but two advanced degrees from this institution. He graduated from the joint J.D./M.B.A. program in 1975, and from there entered the business world. While President Obama spent three years here, Romney spent a total of four.</span></p> <p><span>If Romney has indeed become aware of the deleterious effects of a Harvard education, it must have been a recent epiphany. Three of his sons <a href=\"http://2012.republican-candidates.org/Romney/Children.php\">attended</a> Harvard for their M.B.A.s, suggesting either that their presence on this campus was an act of rebellion against their reluctant father, or that Romney has only caught on to the crippling effects of a Harvard education in the past few years. Then again, even this scenario seems doubtful. After all, Romney counts economics Professor N. Gregory <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/the-advisers-that-romney-ignores-20120119\">Mankiw</a> and Kennedy School Fellow Meghan <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/blogs/mitts-view/2011/10/mitt-romney-announces-foreign-policy-and-national-security-advisory-team\">O\u2019Sullivan</a> among his top advisers.</span></p> <p><span>Most likely, Romney\u2019s apparent change of heart towards his alma mater is an attempt to tap into anti-intellectual sentiment in order to rile the Republican base. Since he has a hard time impressing the far-right wing of the Republican Party with his pedigree, maybe Mr. Romney thinks he can fool them into only scrutinizing his opponent\u2019s. But seriously, he\u2019d have more luck trying to convince them that he\u2019s always been \u201cseverely conservative.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Although Romney\u2019s recent conversion to anti-intellectualism may seem humorous, what it says about his candidacy is troubling. Although the Republican Party styles itself as the party of meritocracy, their appreciation for individual achievement seems to be rather limited. Academic and intellectual merit are <a href=\"http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entries/romney-after-bashing-harvard-faculty-lounge-economics-cites\">regularly</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/santorum-obama-is-a-snob-because-he-wants-everybody-in-america-to-go-to-college/2012/02/25/gIQATJffaR_blog.html\">disparaged</a> by Republican party leaders, even as they routinely exalt the value of <a href=\"http://www.gop.com/index.php/issues/what_we_believe/\">hard work</a>. Experience in academia\u2014a field in which so many conservative luminaries have served\u2014is mocked as not being \u201c<a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2011/09/05/the-new-gop-campaign-line-obama-just-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-a-clue/\">a real job</a>.\u201d It is no wonder that there is a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8427-2005Mar28.html\">dearth</a> of Republicans in our nation\u2019s top universities.</span></p> <p><span>In the same breath that Republicans undermine the value of academic and intellectual accomplishment, they bristle when anyone speaks against the interest of those whose accomplishments have been financial. For example, any suggestion that those whose \u201creal jobs\u201d have brought them immense wealth ought to pay a more in taxes is decried as \u201c<a href=\"http://mojoe.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/09/28/8016221-romney-if-you-want-to-punish-successful-people-vote-for-dems\">punishing</a> success.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>It speaks to the power of the extreme right in today\u2019s Republican party that trash-talking academic achievement is de rigeur even for candidates who hail from Massachusetts, received two Harvard degrees, and are supposedly members of the Republican establishment.

{"title": "Serious About Syria | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In 1982, Hafez Assad, the father of Syria\u2019s current president, encircled a few rebelling neighborhoods of Hama, a city in central Syria, and then promptly leveled them. Tens of thousands died along with their revolution. The world responded to this premeditated massacre as it responds today to events in Sudan\u2014there was no response. Thirty years later, Hafez Assad\u2019s son repeats his father\u2019s massacres with different methods. The international profile of the events may have increased, but the results in 2012 are similar to those in 1982. In fact, this last year in Syria demonstrates that although the international world\u2019s bark is louder, its bite is still weak.</span></p> <p><span>Let\u2019s review last week\u2019s events. After groveling in Moscow and Beijing, Kofi Annan <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2111710,00.html\">pitched his peace plan</a> in Tehran on Wednesday, citing \u201cspecial relations\u201d between Tehran and Damascus. Any illusions of the trip\u2019s success were shattered by the Iranian Foreign Minister\u2019s insistence that change in Syria occur under the helm of Bashar Assad. Which is, more or less, the exact opposite of the desires of the revolutionaries.</span></p> <p><span>Two days ago, on Apr. 11, the Syrian military and the Free Syrian Army <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2111710,00.html\">promised</a> to stop fighting per Annan\u2019s peace plan. As of that evening, the ceasefire was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2111710,00.html\">only partially observed</a>,\u201d according to the Syrian National Council, while Syrian state media already reported one \u201cterrorist\u201d attack. Like <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303299604577324980028050426.html\">last week</a>\u2019s ceasefire, this one, too, will be more of an opportunity to reload than an actual stop to the fighting. After all, a ceasefire only works when both sides want to cease firing.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, Annan\u2019s peace plan is not the only one based in good intentions instead of good results. The past year illustrates that the international community has a full arsenal of what can only be described as \u201cpassive actions.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Speaking to the Washington Post two weeks ago, a senior Obama Administration official <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/syria-crisis-tops-diplomatic-agenda-at-turkey-iran-meeting-arab-league-summit/2012/03/29/gIQAdMpsiS_story_1.html\">explained</a> America\u2019s strategy in Syria: \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is increasing diplomatic pressure, working on humanitarian access, and pushing the transition forward.\u201d If that language sounds familiar, it is because officials have been reciting that diplomatic mumbo-jumbo for almost a year now. In terms of influencing events in foreign relations, tone is as relevant as the words used themselves. And the tone of American officials hardly incites fear in the Syrian regime.</span></p> <p><span>However, don\u2019t worry about American inaction because the European Union recently <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2109888,00.html\">extended its sanctions</a> to Asma Assad, the President\u2019s wife. Presumably, there were concerns that her <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2115239/Syrias-president-Assad-leaked-emails-reveal-shopping-fondue-sets-swapping-YouTube-videos.html\">fondue sets</a> and boutique candles were being transformed into torture devices. By the way, after more than a year, and thirteen official rounds of sanctions against the Syrian regime, the European Union has successfully enacted sanctions on exactly four members of the Assad family and eight government ministers. Double digits! Wunderbar!</span></p> <p><span>Economic sanctions are perhaps the most commonly used passive action. First, as I have <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/11/28/justin-sanctions-panacea/\">written before</a>, politicians and pundits dangerously discuss economic sanctions as if all they are all equal. Furthermore, economic sanctions are meant to be a tool of soft power, but soft power is only effective when there is an implied threat of hard power. Without quality control and hard power backing them up, economic sanctions are more liable to destroy people than governments.</span></p> <p><span>Nor is it simply governments that can be accused of systemic passivity, but also international organizations. Paradoxically, the United Nations\u2019 concern for daily abuses of human rights, alongside Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the whole humanitarian behemoth, can in certain instances prevent the long-term realization of human rights. The precise, day-by-day reports on dead and wounded make lowering those numbers the central priority of the international community instead of the realization of revolution itself. It may not be a comforting idea, but revolutions sometimes require violence. And perhaps we have become too inflexible in our opposition to violence.</span></p> <p><span>While the West counts dead bodies, other forces ensure their continued existence. High-ranking defectors from the Syrian military say Iran \u201c<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-officials-iran-is-stepping-up-lethal-aid-to-syria/2012/03/02/gIQAGR9XpR_story.html\">has dispatched</a> hundreds of advisers, security officials and intelligence operatives to Syria, along with weapons, money, and electronic surveillance equipment.\u201d The revolution was sectarian from its inception. Any suggestions to the contrary are woefully misguided. The West\u2019s passive role was supposed to have limited the possibility of sectarian violence. But only more active steps can prevent its escalation.</span></p> <p><span>One Syrian activist, Radwen Ziadeh, summed up last week\u2019s events with the title of his <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/article/world/102496/syria-assad-ceasefire-turkey-revolution%5D\">editorial</a> in The New Republic, \u201cWhy Did Anyone Believe Bashar Al-Assad\u2019s Promises of Ceasefire to Begin With?\u201d Ziadeh never provides an answer to his own question. He can\u2019t. As spokesperson for the Syria National Council, he won\u2019t say what we all know: Current international gullibility is mainly a consequence of international exasperation with a council that is hardly Syrian, barely national, and rarely a council.

{"title": "Santorum Suspends Presidential Campaign | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Former Senator Rick Santorum announced Tuesday that he would suspend his campaign for the presidency, leaving a clear path for former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney to assume the Republican nomination and challenge President Barack Obama in November\u2019s election.</span></p> <p><span>Even though the Republican national convention will not take place until August, Harvard professors said that Romney has nothing between himself and the nomination. Both Romney and the president are Harvard alumni\u2014Romney from Harvard Business and Law School, Obama from just the Law School\u2014making the race the first between two Harvardians since 2000.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[Romney] technically doesn\u2019t have enough delegates yet,\u201d Institute of Politics director C.M. \u201cTrey\u201d Grayson \u201994 said, but \u201cthere\u2019s no political scenario that would create any other outcome than a Romney nomination.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As he began to pull away in the race for delegates in recent weeks, Romney already had begun to shift his focus to the general election and Obama. Professors said Romney is likely to regroup further as the Republican primary season draws to a close in the coming months, better tempering his campaign and its message for the fall.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI would think that he\u2019s going to shift into a prolonged media and fundraising tour, and he\u2019ll use the completion of the primary cycle as an extended series of victory laps,\u201d said Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Richard Parker. \u201cHe\u2019ll use the process of seeming to campaign to test messages.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A key part of that message will inevitably be choosing a running-mate, but it will also be setting the tenor of the race. Professors said the match-up between the former Massachusetts governor and the president will likely have a different focus than the Republican nominating race.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cCampaigns seek to mobilize their core supporters and appeal to those who are undecided or persuadable. In doing so, they emphasize those issues and themes that are uppermost in the minds of voters and those issues that play to their strengths,\u201d Harvard Kennedy School professor Roger B. Porter wrote in an email.</span></p> <p><span>As things stand, the theme this time around will likely be the economy, professors said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think the key thing is [Romney\u2019s] got to continue to focus on the economy,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cHe\u2019s got to do a better job articulating what is Mitt Romney\u2019s vision for the country. It\u2019s going to be a right of center message.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In his exit speech on Tuesday afternoon, Santorum declared \u201cwe are not done fighting\u201d and that he would continue to help defeat Obama. The support for his party fell short of directly endorsing Romney.</span></p> <p><span>The former Pennsylvania senator dropped out just two weeks shy of his home state\u2019s primary, which political experts have begun to suspect could go to Romney. Though he did not definitively name a reason for dropping out, Santorum had recently taken a few days off from the campaign trail to care for his sick daughter and re-evaluate his campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThose who seek elective office are by and large realists.

Paul D. Ryan\u2019s <a href=\"http://budget.house.gov/fy2013Prosperity/\">budget</a>\u2014a budget that would <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/06/ryan-in-two-numbers\">cut taxes</a>, primarily for high earners, by $4.6 trillion while taking health insurance away from 14 million Medicaid beneficiaries\u2014has been welcomed by centrist elements in Washington as a sensible, hard-headed contribution to the public debate over spending. Maya C. MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, <a href=\"http://crfb.org/document/crfb-reacts-congressman-ryans-budget\">declared</a> that the budget \u201cputs our nation on a fiscally sustainable path.\u201d Robert L. Bixby, who runs the pro-deficit-reduction Concord Coalition, <a href=\"https://mninews.deutsche-boerse.com/index.php/us-budget-experts-see-ryans-fy13-budget-bold-and-flawed?q=content/us-budget-experts-see-ryans-fy13-budget-bold-and-flawed\">judged</a> that the budget \u201cfit the magnitude of the challenge.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But then again, the budget was written in language that deficit hawks love. Ryan <a href=\"http://budget.house.gov/fy2013Prosperity/\">writes</a> that, \u201cAt its core, this plan of action is about putting an end to empty promises from a bankrupt government.\u201d The Ryans, MacGuineases, and Bixbys of the world say stuff like this all the time. We can\u2019t afford the government we have. We\u2019re going bankrupt. It\u2019s unsustainable. And to this day, I have no idea what any of them are trying to say. That may sound like feigned incomprehension, but statements like theirs are truly vague, and none of the things they could mean make much sense.</span></p> <p><span>Do the deficit hawks mean we\u2019re going bankrupt now, or in the next decade? I certainly hope they don\u2019t think either of those things, because that\u2019s absurd. Take a look at interest rates for <a href=\"http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DFII5?cid=115\">five-</a> and <a href=\"http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/FII10?cid=115\">10-year</a> Treasury bills. In both cases, the rates are negative. You should take two things away from this. The first is that if there were a significant risk that the US would default on its debts in the next five or 10 years, then, assuming at least a modicum of market rationality, those interest rates would be very, very high. For comparison, Greece, a country that actually is on the verge of default, has <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GGGB10YR:IND\">interest rates</a> of above 20 percent on its 10-year bonds. When there\u2019s a real risk a bond won\u2019t be paid back, investors demand more interest to make it worthwhile. With Greece, investors are doing just that. With the U.S., they\u2019re doing the opposite.</span></p> <p><span>Which brings me to the second takeaway: Negative interest rates mean that bond-buyers are actually paying debtors for the opportunity to lend them money. This is extremely counterintuitive, so it\u2019s worth driving home for a while. When Treasury interest rates are negative, it is <a href=\"http://modeledbehavior.com/2011/07/10/cheaper-than-cash/\">cheaper</a> for the federal government to pay for its programs by borrowing money than it is for it to pay for them with cash. In a situation like this, borrowing money not only doesn\u2019t \u201cbankrupt\u201d the government, it makes its fiscal situation more secure than it would be without borrowing. In a situation like the current one, running a balanced budget would be positively irresponsible, a huge wasted opportunity.</span></p> <p><span>So if Ryan and his centrist fans are saying that the debt is unsustainable in the near term, they\u2019re just wrong. But maybe they don\u2019t mean that. Maybe they mean that at some point, when interest rates are more normal, America\u2019s welfare state just won\u2019t be supportable anymore, and we\u2019ll need to, say, <a href=\"http://www.offthechartsblog.org/ryan-budget-would-make-big-changes-in-medicare/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+OffTheChartsBlog+%28Off+the+Charts+Blog+%7C+Center+on+Budget+and+Policy+Priorities%29\">privatize Medicare</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3727\">gut Medicaid</a> (and other <a href=\"http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/your-safety-net-on-block-grants\">aid to the poor</a>) to survive. But that\u2019s wrong, too. The U.S. is the richest country in the world, and yet dozens of poorer countries have been able to provide comprehensive health care to all their citizens for <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/insurance/snapshot/oecd042111.cfm\">less than we currently spend</a> on non-universal health care. Of course, they use systems\u2014from single-payer in Canada to something like <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Blog/2011/Oct/Lessons-from-Abroad.aspx\">ObamaCare on steroids</a> in the Netherlands\u2014which the U.S. has yet to adopt, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t afford good, cost-effective health care for everyone. It just means we\u2019ve chosen not to provide it yet.</span></p> <p><span>Note also that the fiscal crisis in Europe has nothing to do with the continent\u2019s welfare states and everything to do with trying to use a single currency to meet the fiscal needs of seventeen different countries. If you don\u2019t believe me, just look at Sweden, which has maybe the most generous welfare state in the world and has maintained its own currency, the krona, rather than adopting the Euro. As a result, it <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/five-economic-lessons-from-sweden-the-rock-star-of-the-recovery/2011/06/21/AGyuJ3iH_story.html\">weathered the financial crisis</a> better than just about any other rich nation, with the possible exception of Canada, which also does more redistributive spending than the U.S. So if you hear people citing Greece or Italy as evidence that social spending bankrupts nations, don\u2019t believe it for a second.</span></p> <p><span>Ryan is a smart guy, and at some level I think he knows that all this talk about \u201cunsustainable\u201d debt is kind of silly. But I also think that he\u2019s serious when he <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/03/20/no_paul_ryan_does_not_want_to_strengthen_the_safety_net.html\">identifies</a> Ayn Rand as the most important influence on his political views (he apparently forces his staffers to read Atlas Shrugged). Ryan\u2019s budget doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense as a response to real national concerns, but it makes a lot of sense as the pursuit of someone who, like his idol Rand, thinks that aiding the poor is fundamentally immoral. The honest case for Ryan\u2019s budget isn\u2019t that we can\u2019t afford to help the poor. It\u2019s that Ryan and his allies just don\u2019t think we should.</span></p> <p><span><i>Dylan R.

{"title": "Reading, 'Rithmetic, and Religion | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In the United States, 53 percent of Protestants can\u2019t identify Martin Luther. Less than half of America knows that the Dalai Lama is Buddhist. While 82 percent of the country knows that Mother Teresa was Catholic, almost half of all Catholics in the United States are unaware of their church\u2019s doctrine of transubstantiation.</span></p> <p><span>This is just a sample of the findings of an infamous <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/U-S-Religious-Knowledge-Survey-Who-Knows-What-About-Religion.aspx\">Pew Research poll</a> published in September 2010. The results indicate that we are a deeply religious country suffering a pandemic of religious illiteracy\u2014including, shockingly, about the very religions that we practice. In an increasingly globalized society, and especially post-9/11, this sort of ignorance about world religions is unacceptable. A comparative religion curriculum should be as mandatory in American high schools as curricula in biology or American history</span></p> <p><span>Hesitancy towards such a proposal is understandable. <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/10/4/religion-nbsp-religious-beliefs/\">Critics</a>, of course, correctly insist that there exists a separation of church and state in this country and that the American government is secular even if the American people aren\u2019t. Allowing the government to facilitate religious learning, even for a secular purpose, one might argue, is counterproductive to the aim of keeping religion and politics in America scrupulously separate.</span></p> <p><span>But separation of church and state is exactly why we ought to have a high school curriculum on religion. The purpose of the Establishment Clause is to prevent federal endorsement of one particular religion\u2014respecting \u201can\u201d established religion, in the amendment\u2019s language.<b> </b>But teaching all religions together, without any emphasis on a particular religion, leads to pluralism, not sectarianism. Reading excerpts of the Bhagavad-Gita or the Koran, while qualifying their study with phrases like \u201cHindus believe\u201d or \u201cMuslims believe,\u201d imposes neither religion on students but increases tolerance of both. With cultural diffusion as prevalent as ever in the modern era, understanding the religion of a society different than your own is as important\u2014if not more\u2014as understanding the language that society speaks.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, a high school curriculum in comparative religion is entirely constitutional. Although it is illegal for a high school instructor in America to lead the class in prayer, for example, it is perfectly legal for a teacher to read from religious texts as examples of world literature. This is a fact even acknowledged by Americans United for Separation of Church and State.<b> </b>As they state on their <a href=\"http://www.au.org/issues/faqs.html?issue_category=religion-in-public-schools\">website</a>, \u201cthe Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires the government to be neutral with respect to religion,\u201d but \u201cbecause the Bible has considerable significance in Western literature and history, it may be incorporated into a public-school curriculum.\u201d<b> </b>Ironically, the Pew poll revealed that 77 percent of the country does not know this, most likely because of civil liberties groups that cry foul at even the slightest endorsement of religious content in public schools.</span></p> <p><span>Curing religious illiteracy in the U.S. is also essential to ensuring informed political discussion. Consider, for example, Mitt Romney\u2019s Mormonism. Over the course of his campaign, Romney has been the victim of numerous smears because of his faith. In publications as mainstream <a href=\"http://blogs.the-american-interest.com/wrm/2011/11/28/nyt-slimes-romney/\">as the New York Times</a>, Romney\u2019s detractors have falsely accused the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints of seeking to take over the government in order to establish a theocracy in this country. And with Rick Santorum out of the running for the general election, an evangelical leader close to the Romney campaign has <a href=\"http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/11/evangelical-leader-mormonism-will-become-a-bigger-issue-for-romney/\">predicted</a> that Romney\u2019s critics will start turning up the heat on his faith, in hopes of \u201cturn[ing] off independents who say \u2018I don\u2019t want to vote for a guy that believes that.\u2019\u201d Having a basic understanding of what a religious institution does and does not believe, in other words, has become crucial to being a knowledgeable citizen in this country, and American political discourse would look very different if students were taught this subject in school.</span></p> <p><span><b> </b></span></p> <p><span>Critics may still claim that teachers would co-opt a curriculum in world religion to impose their own religious ideologies on their students. But this criticism could be leveled at almost every academic discipline. A teacher\u2019s Marxism might influence how he teaches the economics of labor\u2014should we refrain from teaching students economics? An anarchist instructor might attempt to convince her pupils that the American governmental system is inherently unjust\u2014should we abolish civics? American education should be judged on the material it teaches, not on outlying cases in which instructors are unfit to teach it.</span></p> <p><span>At a recent TED Conference, Daniel C. Dennett \u201963 made an impassioned plea for a mandated religious curriculum in U.S. schools. A comparative religious education leads to \u201cmaximal tolerance for religious freedom,\u201d he argued, and \u201cdemocracy depends on an informed citizenship.\u201d Dennett is far from a religious enthusiast\u2014in 2006, he penned a book in which he argued that all religions are man-made phenomena. And Dennett\u2019s support is the best proof that one can offer that there is little religious proselytizing in a religious education for high school students. Due to its role in fostering pluralism, informed political decisions, and tolerance, a comparative religion course does far more to preserve the fundamental tenets of the United States than undermine them.</span></p> <p><span><i>Avishai D.

In the shoulders, everything has to be made on purpose for people who are curvy, so it\u2019s completely different.

{"title": "Reconceiving Intervention | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Despite the intricacies involved, military and humanitarian interventions have become a tool of choice for the international community to solve problems of human security and disaster relief. In light of recent failures, the rationale behind the use and implementation of intervention deserves to be refined and rethought. The relief efforts in Haiti and nation-building efforts in Afghanistan have been of questionable success, while recklessly endangering civilian lives and fostering distrust among local populations. This is because policy-makers have lost the sense of humility that comes with an in-depth knowledge of a foreign environment. In order for any future interventions to be more successful than those in Haiti and Afghanistan, planning for development projects and military incursions must involve a much more careful study of local history and anthropology, and a focus on engaging with residents in genuine partnership.</span></p> <p><span>New York Times reporter Deborah Sontag recently published an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/world/americas/haitis-cholera-outraced-the-experts-and-tainted-the-un.html\">article</a> detailing how the United Nations failed to accept responsibility for being the source of the cholera epidemic in Haiti, and how the ensuing relief efforts have only nurtured popular distrust of authorities. Lawyers bemoan that, in a country whose history includes numerous occasions where the rule of law has broken down, the United Nations\u2019 refusal to accept responsibility will only \u201cdemonstrate that once again in Haiti, \u2018might makes right.\u2019\u201d Now an international relief effort has been launched in response to the epidemic, and some health policy officials do not want to distribute vaccines, out of worries that such a measure could give Haitians \u201ca false sense of security and become lax about hygiene.\u201d This notion is not substantiated by anything other than idle speculation. The United Nations\u2019 refusal to take responsibility for the epidemic, and the unwillingness of health officials to distribute vaccines, is grounded in a willful ignorance of Haitian history and anthropology. Sontag describes the overall relief effort as an \u201coften awkward collaboration\u201d in which \u201cinternational health officials deferred to the Haitians\u2014\u201cour partners\u201d\u2014but in reality held the purse strings and know-how.\u201d One wonders what the true value of the international community\u2019s \u201cknow-how\u201d is, when it does not stem from localized knowledge and engagement with Haitians.</span></p> <p><span>Nation-building efforts in Afghanistan are failing because they are similarly uninformed by engagement with Afghan communities and localized knowledge. President Obama <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-on-a-New-Strategy-for-Afghanistan-and-Pakistan\">stated</a> the goal of the military intervention as being to prevent the Afghan people from having to face a return to \u201cbrutal governance\u2026and the denial of basic human rights.\u201d However, a lack of knowledge and engagement with local communities may be causing some interveners to dehumanize the very population whose rights they seek to protect. The recent failure of the U.S. military to prevent <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/03/world/asia/5-soldiers-are-said-to-face-punishment-in-koran-burning-in-afghanistan.html?ref=Koran\">the burning of Korans</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/world/asia/gulf-widens-between-us-and-an-increasingly-hostile-karzai.html?ref=afghanistan&amp;pagewanted=all\">a soldier\u2019s killings of 16 Afghan civilians</a> should prompt a careful inspection of the experiential gap that lies between military interveners and those who reside in local communities. Defense Policy Board Advisor Sarah B. Sewall \u201883\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/03/17/148811133/where-is-counterinsurgency-in-afghanistan-now\">describes</a> such events as being just a few of many instances where intervening forces \u201cdo an extremely poor job of putting themselves in other people's moccasins,\u201d describing how \u201cthe extent to which we\u2019ve expected Afghans to tolerate civilian deaths\u201d is evidence that, in the mind of the interveners, \u201cAfghans have become somewhat inured to civilian harm.\u201d Like the Haitian humanitarian intervention, a lack of engagement with residents has prompted these nation-building efforts to become detached from the reality they seek to change.</span></p> <p><span>In order to prevent future interventions from becoming botched in the manner seen in Haiti and Afghanistan, the international community will have to overhaul its approach to training policy-makers and development officials. In a recent essay entitled \u201cThe Plane To Kabul,\u201d former diplomat and senior coalition officer Rory Stewart <a href=\"http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=20615\">attempts to distill</a> the root causes behind why intervention efforts pursue goals that are not grounded in the reality of the populations they seek to aid. His key insight is that much of the failure of interventions does \u201cnot lie simply in poor preparation, planning, decisions, resource deployment, or even the absence of a specialized cadre of interveners\u201d but rather is \u201cpredetermined by modern Western culture,\u201d in particular \u201ca materialist worldview whose gods were technology and progress, which denied the reality of cultural difference and which was driven by a bizarre optimism.\u201d This combination of over-confidence and lack of cultural awareness is clear in the rhetoric of world health officials in Haiti and in the dehumanization of Afghan civilians. Stewart is completely correct in recommending that the only way to escape such delusion is to engage in \u201can ever more detailed study of the history, the geography, and the anthropology of a particular place, on the one hand, and of the limitations and manias of the West, on the other,\u201d prior to staging an intervention. Before we endeavor to aid other nations in any manner, we will have to change our own culture of intervention.</span></p> <p><span><i>Nikhil R.

Not only is Dr. Kim the first person of Asian descent to become president of the World Bank (he immigrated to the United States from South Korea at the age of 5) but unlike his predecessors who have been <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/jim-yong-kim-the-right-choice-for-the-world-bank/2012/03/23/gIQADnIlWS_story.html\">bankers, politicians, or technocrats</a>, Dr. Kim has dedicated his life\u2019s work to international development. He is the first to have in-the-field development experience as a physician and public health expert. As<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2012/03/23/president-obama-nominates-jim-yong-kim-world-bank-president\"> President Obama declared</a>, \u201cIt\u2019s time for a development professional to lead the world's largest development agency.\u201d As students dedicated to international development, we could not agree more.</span></p> <p><span>Since its birth in the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference, the World Bank has favored conservative \u201cfree-market\u201d policies with detrimental, unintended consequences for the poor. For instance, the countries that accepted structural adjustment loans\u2014loans that were tied to strict neo-liberal reforms\u2014guided by the World Bank were often forced to siphon money away from their health sector to avoid defaulting on their debt, ultimately resulting in further dependency on loans and further accumulation of debt.\u00a0We applaud President Obama\u2019s nomination and the bank board\u2019s appointment of Dr. Kim as representing an important shift away from the neoliberal orthodoxy of the Washington Consensus.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. Kim\u2019s ideology reflects the World Bank\u2019s broader mission of economic growth, while still recognizing the problematic ramifications of past World Bank policies. What makes Dr. Kim a profound thinker can be found in his seminal work,<a href=\"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0277953604004575/1-s2.0-S0277953604004575-main.pdf?_tid=ce0f09b3c3f31243b8a914a64236979a&amp;acdnat=1334382180_074c802a3ac7663c2e5c0a8c5b0f4d92\"> \"Limited Good, Limited Vision.\"</a> Dr. Kim was the first to fight back against the pervasive notion of \u201climited good,\u201d which argues that funding more expensive development programs detracts from equally necessary, less-expensive initiatives. Dr. Kim urged the development community to move from \u201ctheories of limited good to theories and actions that are based on an understanding of the scale and importance of the problem.\u201d Unlike his predecessors, who focus primarily on the cost-effectiveness of programs, Dr. Kim recognizes the underlying economic and moral imperatives of the World Bank to focus on equalizing efforts that invest in human beings. His vision of inclusive growth promotes long-term prosperity coupled with attempts to build equity and scale up community development successes.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. Kim\u2019s philosophies have been shaped by years of in-the-field experience, another reason that he is such an inspired choice for the World Bank presidency. As co-founder of<a href=\"http://www.pih.org/\"> Partners in Health</a>, which delivers health care in resource poor settings, Dr. Kim has worked directly with the most marginalized populations of Haiti, Peru, Rwanda, Lesotho, and the United States. The geographic breadth of his work, ranging from capital cities to villages, demonstrates precisely the practical exposure to development that the World Bank president ought to wield. In his<a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1510.aspx\"> op-ed</a>, Kim said, \u201cI have confronted the forces that keep more than one billion people trapped in poverty.\u201d He continued, \u201cI want to hear from developing countries, as well as those that provide a big share of the resources to development, about how we can together build a more inclusive, responsive, and open World Bank.\u201d Indeed, Dr. Kim\u2019s practical experience as a physician to the global poor has shaped his vision of inclusivity and openness.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. Kim\u2019s determination to make the World Bank more inclusive reflects his leadership capacity. Despite his<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kims-smart-stance-on-growth/2012/04/11/gIQA6SqABT_story.html\"> humility</a>, Dr. Kim has proven that he is not afraid to challenge the status quo, an attribute that couldn\u2019t be of greater importance in the realm of development economics, where models and orthodoxy often outweigh practical, scalable solutions. Dr. Kim fought against conventional wisdom that argued that PIH\u2019s work was not cost-effective, in fact showing that health is the fundamental pillar to economic growth. When appointed advisor to the director-general of the World Health Organization, and later, director of the WHO\u2019s HIV/AIDS department, Dr. Kim led the \u201c3 by 5\u201d initiative, designed to put 3 million people living with AIDS in developing nations on treatment by 2005. \u00a0Launched in 2003, the program reached its goal in 2007, demonstrating that individuals deemed untreatable could actually be treated effectively. Finally, Dr. Kim\u2019s numerous positions within institutions of higher learning demonstrate his capacity for leadership. In 2009, Kim left his post at Harvard to become president of Dartmouth College, where he proved to be an astute leader, particularly in<a href=\"http://thedartmouth.com/2012/03/29/news/faculty\"> successfully handling the university\u2019s budget crisis</a>.</span></p> <p><span>As members of the<a href=\"http://sayyestodrugs2.org/\"> Harvard Global Health and AIDS Coalition</a>, which had the honor of having Dr. Kim as an advisor, we look to Dr. Kim as a visionary. When Dr. Kim co-taught Anthropology 1825: Case Studies in Global Health, he emphasized the importance of evidence-based rationality and intellectual rigor coupled with genuine compassion and inclusivity. We would be shocked if his critical eye does not create a noticeable change in the World Bank. Dr. Kim\u2019s track record has demonstrated his ability to focus on the outcomes of development, rather than becoming trapped in the bureaucratic machinery of the processes behind it. We hope that Dr. Kim will lead and innovate with the fervor that we have always admired, bringing sustainable, equitable development to the communities that the World Bank has always claimed to serve.</span></p> <p><span><i>Alyssa T.

{"title": "Grandstanding on the Hill | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>This Tuesday, officials from the Government Services Agency were paraded before a Congressional committee and interrogated about the agency\u2019s $823,000 conference in Las Vegas. This same week, U.S. officials opened an investigation on a group of Secret Service agents who threw a hotel room party, possibly involving prostitutes, while waiting for President Obama\u2019s arrival in Colombia. These scandals have led politicians on both sides of the aisle to denounce the \u201cculture of fraud, waste, and corruption\u201d among Washington bureaucrats. During the GSA hearing, Transportation subcommittee chairman Jeff Denham commented that given activities like these, \u201cWe wonder why there is so much mistrust in government.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Congressman Denham, you should not be so quick to judge. It is not mistrust in bureaucratic officials and their inclinations to party, but mistrust in our nation\u2019s political leaders, that is truly damaging. Over the past 30 years, Congress\u2019 approval rating has fallen from a pretty bad 39 percent after the 2012 election to an abysmal 12 percent in the latest polls. It is Congress\u2019 inability to tackle effectively the defining issues of our time that is truly detrimental. While Congress berates these bureaucrats, it is distracted from more important matters. Our country still has no clear plan about our energy future. We still lack a plan to fix our broken education system. Our infrastructure continues to crumble while Congressional officials opine on government employees\u2019 sex lives.</span></p> <p><span>This is not to say that these scandals should be ignored or thrown under the rug. Government agents hosting parties in Las Vegas or partying in Colombia while on official government business is indeed outrageous, and offenders should be dealt with harshly. Those directly involved in these incidents should be fired if the investigators find evidence suggesting that such punishment is appropriate. The directors of agencies that allow scandalous abuses of power to take place under their watch should also be investigated. However, these investigations do not need to be a matter of public concern. Moreover, members of Congress should not use scandals in government agencies to distract Americans from the real issues at hand. They must not harp on agency abuses in order to cast themselves, in contrast, as exemplar government officials and defenders of the taxpayer.</span></p> <p><span>Last summer, Congress muddled through negotiations over how to decrease our deficit and deal with our debt problem. Many politicians focused on the need to cut waste, fraud, and abuse, and ignored the more important need to raise taxes and enact entitlement reform. In the end, Congress\u2019s inability to focus on core issues simply kicked the can down the road. It eventually passed on the responsibility of deficit report to a supercommittee, and enacted automatic cuts if this supercommittee failed to find those cuts (which it did). Still, those automatic cuts are tepid, and Congress can cancel them if it wishes to. Congress has still failed to address key, foundational issues, leaving Americans with a temporary and unsustainable solution to the deficit crisis. This uncertainty is worse for the taxpayer than the recent GSA and Secret Service scandals. It is no less wasteful for our money to be thrown away on unnecessary interest payments than on bureaucrats\u2019 parties.</span></p> <p><span>The United States rates a respectable 7.1 out of 10 on the Corruption Perceptions Index. Unlike many countries, in which government employees regularly embezzle and abuse taxpayer dollars, America has a fairly good record on government accountability, and structures to investigate any abuses. These parties were singular incidents and to portray them as otherwise is disingenuous.</span></p> <p><span>Therefore, it would do the country well for Congress to quickly deal with these transgressions and get back to work that really matters.</span></p> <p><span><i>Jos</i><i>\u00e9 I.

{"title": "Crossing the Line | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In the past few months, Americans have been exposed to a barrage of hateful and offensive commentary by public figures. Maybe the seeming deluge of caustic statements owes itself to the presidential campaign, or maybe we\u2019re just becoming more sensitive to this kind of speech, but it nevertheless seems as though we are inundated daily with comments that cross the line of decency. First there was Rush Limbaugh calling a Georgetown Law student who testified before Congress a <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/03/rush-limbaugh-apologizes-for-verbal-attack/\">\u201cslut\u201d</a>; then there was actor Robert DeNiro making an off-color <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/21/entertainment-us-deniro-obama-idUSBRE82K1GU20120321\">joke</a> about whether \u201cour country is ready for a white first lady\u201d; finally there was Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2012-04-19/news/31367994_1_ann-romney-women-voters-mitt-romney\">claiming</a> that Ann Romney, wife of presidential candidate Mitt Romney and mother of five children, \u201chas never actually worked a day in her life.\u201d And there are <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/03/axelrod-mittzkrieg-comment-draws-fire-from-jewish-group/\">countless</a> <a href=\"http://www.breezejmu.org/opinion/article_ecedb8c6-8ce0-11e1-b1bd-001a4bcf6878.html\">other</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nationals/ozzie-guillens-suspension-is-over-but-the-public-relations-crisis-may-continue/2012/04/19/gIQAmJYETT_story.html\">examples</a>, just within the past few days and weeks, of comments that have caused a firestorm of controversy for offending specific individuals and groups.</span></p> <p><span>Opinions on our offense-prone culture have been mixed. Last month, comedian Bill Maher published an article in the New York Times entitled <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/22/opinion/please-stop-apologizing.html\">\u201cPlease Stop Apologizing,\u201d</a> in which he argued that Americans\u2019 tendency \u201cto be outraged about nothing\u201d was impoverishing political discourse: \u201cIf we sand down our rough edges and drain all the color, emotion and spontaneity out of our discourse, we\u2019ll end up with political candidates who never say anything but the safest, blandest, emptiest, most unctuous focus-grouped platitudes and cant.\u201d If a radio commentator or television show annoys you, Maher says, the answer is easy: Stop listening to the program.</span></p> <p><span>Maher\u2019s got a point: Americans do tend to be offended when they shouldn\u2019t, and a little less sensitivity might encourage politicians to break through the banality of campaign slogans to offer innovative political ideas. But his editorial is typical of a certain type of response to offensive incidents\u2014a response that argues for tolerating speech you disagree with, ignoring speech that offends you, and (to paraphrase Voltaire) defending others\u2019 right to speak even when one disagrees with the content. Sarah Palin typified the latter point in her <a href=\"http://blogs.suntimes.com/scanners/2012/03/slutgate.html\">defense</a> of Limbaugh after last month\u2019s controversy: \u201cI think the definition of hypocrisy is for Rush Limbaugh to have been called out, forced to apologize and retract what it is that he said in exercising his First Amendment rights.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This is where the argument goes off the rails. Individuals characteristically regard criticism of their actions as criticism of their right to engage in those actions. In this case, the attack on offensive comments is misconstrued as an attack on the offending individual\u2019s \u201cfree speech\u201d rights; in actuality, it is simply an attack on the content<i> </i>of that speech. Rush Limbaugh had a First Amendment right to say exactly what he said, but listeners have a corresponding right to call in and complain about the comments, and to urge advertisers to drop their financial support for the program.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, in contrast to Maher\u2019s argument, individuals who are offended by what Limbaugh or others said have an obligation to attack his words and urge him to apologize. This is the nature of democratic debate and intellectual discourse; it\u2019s the core of the give-and-take that goes with argumentation. One of the highlights of such debate is that it tends to kill bad ideas: Once exposed to criticism and objections, the emptiness of bad ideas becomes apparent, and they can be dismissed. But a world in which we only listen to radio programs or talk shows with which we agree\u2014Maher\u2019s utopia\u2014is a world that lacks this give-and-take, that allows bad ideas to flourish among those who unthinkingly agree with them, that fails to expose those ideas to the kind of argumentation that would result in their deserved death. The solution to an offensive comment isn\u2019t to allow it to pass unnoticed into the airwaves; it\u2019s to criticize vehemently the comment and demand a rightful apology, just as occurred with regard to the Limbaugh, DeNiro, and Rosen comments mentioned above. The system worked in these cases, and we have an obligation to engage in the same critical behavior when future comments give rise to offense\u2014not to passively change the station.</span></p> <p><span>This is the paradox of Maher\u2019s position: in search of a more vigorous political discourse filled with \u201cemotion and spontaneity\u201d he stumbles into a more impoverished one. One-sided conversation\u2014the \u201csafest, blandest, emptiest, most unctuous focus-grouped\u201d conversation of all\u2014is the kind that would thrive in Maher\u2019s world. That\u2019s not a world in which I would want to live.</span></p> <p><span><i>Peter M. Bozzo \u201912 is a government concentrator in Eliot House. </i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Red Hot Politics  | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It\u2019s not that the French media doesn\u2019t report on the private lives of their various presidential candidates. Every newspaper stand I passed in Paris this weekend had a series of tabloids speculating on whether President Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s wife looks disheveled because she has a new lover or merely because she has a new baby. The gossip about current president Sarkozy and once-hopeful Dominique Strauss-Kahn alone gets quite juicy. It\u2019s just that somehow, no matter how scintillating the speculation, the French seem to leave it out of the voting booths. Consider, for example, how\u00a0socialist candidate Fran\u00e7ois G. G. Hollande lost patience\u00a0when a reporter asked him about Sarkozy\u2019s love life and immediately turned the discussion towards more public scandals. It was apparently not politically necessary (that is, useful) for Monsieur Hollande to gossip on national television.</span></p> <p><span>In contrast to Sarkozy, Newt L. Gingrich has been battling much harder to get past voter prejudice about his various infidelities and serial marriages.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/01/the-john-kingnewt-gingrich-exchange-111596.html\">When John King asked him a question</a> about whether he\u2019d asked an ex-wife for an open marriage on national television, he, like Hollande, lost it, saying:\u00a0\u201cI think the destructive vicious negative nature of much of the news media makes it harder to govern this country, harder to attract decent people to run for public office. I\u2019m appalled you would begin a presidential debate on a topic like that.\u201d\u00a0But Gingrich's concerns are more serious than those of the French presidential contenders because many political commentators worry that his personal history will keep him lagging behind the more\u00a0politically liberal Mitt Romney. It\u2019s evident in this race, as in so many, that Americans are preoccupied with the personal peccadilloes of their political leaders in a way that doesn\u2019t reflect concrete political concerns.\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, a politician\u2019s private life reveals his character in many ways, but we focus more readily on private than public offenses. For example, pundits have happily noted that Gingrich led the charge against Bill Clinton\u2019s adultery while undertaking his own. But he faced comparatively little heat for his\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/04/us/politics/gingrichs-deep-ties-to-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac.html?pagewanted=all\">accepting a large salary for work of a dubious nature</a> from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Why do Americans care more about private hypocrisy than the kind that costs taxpayers millions of dollars?</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s not just that sex sells and is more fun to talk about than tax policy. (After all, sex is interesting to the French, as well.) It\u2019s not even that it\u2019s what matters most to us\u2014on the contrary,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/153029/Economy-Paramount-Issue-Voters.aspx\">social issues are often voters\u2019 least important concerns</a>. Perhaps it\u2019s that sex is also less confusing to Americans than politics. There is a quiet ignorance and ambivalence about the abstractions and complexities of non-sexual issues. Consider\u00a0<a href=\"http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/05/poll-plurality-oppose-raising-debt-ceiling-but-many-undecided.php\">how many Americans confess that they don\u2019t know</a> how they feel about the debt ceiling (37 percent). Thinking about adultery (and contraception and abortion) is easier for Americans, perhaps, because they face personal decisions about these issues every day. We are less certain about how we feel about abstract political issues than sexual ethics, and we transform the latter into identity politics.</span></p> <p><span>This leaves us vulnerable to harboring distorted political concerns.\u00a0The\u00a0<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/03/nation/la-na-newt-gingrich-20110303\">evangelical Christians that Gingrich\u2019s campaign has fought hard to win</a> over probably are not concerned that his sexual scruples, or lack thereof, will directly affect their lives. Rather, they seek a candidate who represents them, and finding a candidate who shares (or onto whom they can project) their own moral views and aspirations is a bigger priority than creating better policies. It matters more what our politicians seem to say about us than what they do for us.</span></p> <p><span>Our obsession with sex\u2014more specifically, our readiness to immediately identify it as a moral issue in politics\u2014probably explains in part why we so quickly turn to politicians\u2019 sex lives when the time comes to vote. (It might even explain the recent explosion of discussions about contraception, which quickly devolved into argument about how women ought to run their sex lives.) All this is amusing but troubling. Sex is only one moral issue, and we would probably benefit from greater moral clarity about the rest. For that matter, Americans aren\u2019t actually stars at managing their sex lives, yet it remains an issue about which we have strong opinions. How well can we make decisions about things we are less sure about? We are going to need to focus first on how the politicians we elect will affect the country and return to speculating about their bedroom habits later, perhaps once we\u2019ve thoughtfully voted.</span></p> <p><span><i>Sarah C.

President Obama has now <a href=\"http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-14/us/28271975_1_education-budget-higher-education-community-colleges\">declared</a> an \u201ceducation arms race\u201d with China, and the unspoken ultimatum hangs in the air like an ugly grade: Start studying or China will sweep us off our global throne.</span></p> <p><span>What are the Chinese doing right? To many, Chinese education is a black box. The impression most of us have of the typical Chinese student is woven together from a bricolage of culturally pressed images\u2014the honors student and the four-eyed physics wonk, the math nerd and the Rubik\u2019s Cube black belt\u2014but the fuller account of why Chinese students are who they are rarely floats into the public consciousness. That fuller story involves the gaokao.</span></p> <p><span>The gaokao (rhymes with bow wow) is the college entrance exam that Chinese students take at the end of high school. In preparation, students select either sciences or humanities early in high school and study for up to 16 hours a day, often working through weekends, for the rest of their high school careers. The test itself can last several days, and ambulances and paramedics pepper the exam facilities to revive those who faint from exhaustion. If you ace the test, then you go to a topflight school\u00a0 and are set for life (Chinese universities don\u2019t care about anything other than your test score). If you\u2019re sick during the test or for some reason perform sub-par, then you may take a \u201cgap year\u201d during which you study to take the test over again. My Beijing teacher told me that her high school sometimes gave her only half a day off per month from studying.</span></p> <p><span>And we thought getting into Harvard took work.</span></p> <p><span>Work is what it\u2019s all about. For most of my year in China, I was a student at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Its majestic campus is home to established professors and brilliantly gifted students. My Chinese classmates could integrate and derive and differentiate equations with ease. But for all their firepower, where was the intellectual spark\u2014the creative flare that can spring you out from inside the box?</span></p> <p><span>There are boons to the gaokao<i> </i>system. Chinese students learn a lot from the process. The test also promotes meritocracy, rewarding the hard workers over the apple-polishers whom teachers shower with good grades. Above all, the test encourages old-fashioned hard work\u2014students who perform badly may see their life aspirations begin to clot before their first kiss (many Chinese high-schools forbid relationships lest they interfere with schoolwork).</span></p> <p><span>Yet my Chinese friends would have been the first to tell you that the gaokao encourages a lockstep approach to learning. One friend told me that her literature professor taught great books mostly by lecturing on the writer\u2019s biographical information and various publication dates. Perhaps that\u2019s what happens when you locate the golden snitch in a single test score: students come to kowtow to the gaokao, more or less allowing their education to revolve around its golden measuring stick. \u201cYou learn,\u201d a friend told me, \u201cnot to always be right but at least to never be wrong.\u201d<b> </b></span></p> <p><span>Students become outcome-oriented. Test results become the be all and end all of one\u2019s education.</span></p> <p><span>This system produces high-voltage, water-cooled brainiacs who will channel their knowledge into an economy that is already rolling. Yet all this time spent on an educational conveyor belt can chill one\u2019s creative flare. I talked to one Chinese father who said that his seventh-grade son\u2019s writing ability had not improved since second grade.</span></p> <p><span>Contrast all this with the American system, in which colleges select applicants based in part on recommendations and personal essays, which work to paint a portrait behind the GPA. Who you are is just as important as what you\u2019ve done. This side of the Pacific, it\u2019s easier to take intellectual risks and color outside the lines. That our life trajectory does not depend on our transcript gives us a safe space to struggle and fail.</span></p> <p><span>As we try in the near future to reform our own education system, there will be pressure to look to China\u2019s as the model. Resist.</span></p> <p><span><i>Gregory D. Kristof \u201915, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Hurlbut Hall.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Rock Chalk, Mr. President | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>President Obama bets the chalk. Every March, in what has become a public relations ritual, Mr. Obama releases his National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament brackets, and, every March, he\u2014like the rest of America\u2014fails to complete a perfect bracket. This failure, though, does not bother me (in fact, Mr. Obama identified the winning Tar Heels in 2009, in a March of his happier salad days, with an extra ten-plus percent of Americans\u2019 approval). But the chalk\u2014the chalk gets to me.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBetting the chalk\u201d is a vestige from pre-electronic gambling, which refers to heavily relying on favorites\u2014so called because, as more and more money poured in behind the favorite, chalkboard listings required constant updates. Unlike the case for most betting scenarios, in the standard March Madness pool (albeit some allot extra points to upset picks), only correct answers matter. So betting the chalk has the highest odds of success, and also the highest odds of being replicated, which in the average year\u2019s large office pool leaves a chalk-better with a respectable but unimpressive finish. Betting the chalk is cautious. It is prudent but restricted. Both above-average and mediocre. You might almost call it conservative.</span></p> <p><span>That term rarely finds its way to President Obama, but it really does fit his bracketology. Of twelve prior <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/images/brackets2009c.jpg\">Final</a> <a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/gen/149730/BARACK-OBAMA-NCAA-BRACKET-MARCH-MADNESS.jpg\">Four</a> <a href=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/politics/assets_c/2011/03/Obama%202011%20NCAA%20bracket-thumb-600x422-44985.png\">selections</a> as president, he has chosen nine number one seeds and, in a bold departure, three number two teams. (It turns out, only about 42 percent of the correct twelve were ones or twos, but then again, I\u2019m not here to grade performance; mine is much worse.) This year\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/image/20120313-potus-picks-2012.jpg\">bracket</a> is no less cautious. It sports two number one teams in the final four, and two twos\u2014<a href=\"http://swampland.time.com/2012/03/14/obamas-ncaa-basketball-bracket-predictable-and-pandering/\">but</a> those second-seeds are matched up opposite the weakest pair of the top four, Syracuse and Michigan State. The lone long-shot in the Sweet Sixteen is North Carolina State\u2014but, despite the 11-seed branding, Las Vegas favored the Wolfpack to win their first game over number six San Diego State. Aside from a few less-than-daring ten-over-seven selections, Mr. Obama\u2019s only other upset of note comes from number 12 Virginia Commonwealth. <a href=\"http://swampland.time.com/2012/03/14/obamas-ncaa-basketball-bracket-predictable-and-pandering/\">But</a> the twelve-seed upset is de rigueur; a twelve has undone a five-seed in all but three prior tournaments\u2014and what better a choice than last year\u2019s glass-slippered darlings, VCU? <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/15/news/la-pn-obamas-ncaa-bracket-shows-some-love-for-swing-states-20120314\">One</a> might even accuse the Obama bracket as politically influenced (three of four Final Four teams\u2014University of North Carolina, Ohio State, and Missouri\u2014from potential 2012 battlegrounds) if it weren\u2019t for the uniform sterility those picks embody. That is, if the chalk weren\u2019t flying everywhere.</span></p> <p><span>Mr. Obama\u2019s brackets say something about him. That conjecture might feel unfair, but he is the POTUS\u2014over-scrutiny is a price he pays. At least, those cautious picks fit a broader narrative. The president, in many respects, has had a cautious tenure (and his campaign, like it or not\u2014with its patented pay-your-fair-share and say-no-to-the-party-of-no approach\u2014seems similarly situated). After a predictable early-on push for campaign promises, Mr. Obama has followed, in many respects the path of least resistance. On foreign policy and terrorism he has gestured to the left with some war-ending grandiosity but has dithered in Afghanistan, unwilling to fully leave or to fully stay, and has dealt with captured terrorists as a Republican might. On the economic frontier, his debt-ceiling kerfuffle ended in anti-climax\u2014no new revenues, no substantive cuts. The list is longer, but, in fairness, there have been obstacles. Yet Steve Jobs\u2019 words must speak for many on the left: \u201cThe president is very smart. But he kept explaining to us reasons why things can\u2019t get done. It infuriates me.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Still, I must confess, my view is biased: I am no Obama-enthusiast. But although I sit on the spectrum\u2019s conservative half, that doesn\u2019t mean I embrace caution, at least not political caution (maybe I am living through America vicariously; I\u2019ll talk that one over with my therapist). It does mean I am faced with a probable nominee who relishes that embrace. An odds-on Republican who clings to an opinion poll the way pundits accuse his counterpart of clinging to a teleprompter, a man made by the free market who has blared out anti-market trade positions, a politician whose healthcare proposals morph as one voting pool supplants another, a candidate with a low-change tax policy, who opted for a slightly-more-change tax policy when pushed. A man \u201cnot plugged-in enough,\u201d in his words, even to complete a March Madness bracket (lest he pick incorrectly). All of that well-publicized caution triggers a guttural frustration in me\u2014playing not to lose, as they say; not playing to win.</span></p> <p><span>Most people, my economics textbook tells me, are risk-averse: They gain less happiness from each marginal bit of something good\u2014and thus more unhappiness from each marginal piece that disappears. That might mean we should welcome a cautious president\u2014and I certainly don\u2019t want a firebrand. But maybe, I want a president with conviction, with a vision for the country, not a piecemealed rearguard scheme. Maybe I want a Lincoln or a Reagan or (and this is conservative anathema) a Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Sure, betting the chalk puts you right up near the top. But maybe I want to win.</span></p> <p><span><i>Brian L. Cronin \u201915, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Wigglesworth Hall.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "How Technology Can Increase Media Transparency | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>A few weeks ago, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/fox-newss-unemployment-chart-better-graphics/2011/12/12/gIQAUVgNqO_blog.html\">a chart</a> by Fox News titled \u201cUnemployment Rate Under Obama\u201d appeared on my Facebook newsfeed. It consisted of a line graph intersecting a dozen or so data points, each representing the unemployment rate for a given month. It showed what appeared to be a plateau in unemployment in recent months.</span></p> <p><span>At first glance, the chart seemed utterly unremarkable: each axis is labeled, there is a title, a source is credited, and each axis does not appear immediately misleading. Upon closer examination, however, you\u2019ll notice that the 8.6 percent unemployment rate cited by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in November is actually above the 9 percent axis gridline. Although the numbers clearly suggest that the unemployment rate has decreased from 9 percent to 8.6 percent, the trend line shows no change.</span></p> <p><span>I don\u2019t want to target Fox News as the sole perpetrator of misinformation. <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/research/200903070004\">To be fair</a>, left-leaning news sources have <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/03/nancy-pelosis-debt-chart-obama-bush_n_989425.html\">published misleading</a> or inaccurate charts, and it\u2019s unclear whether such inaccuracies are accidental or deliberate. Yet the question of bias in the news media is a larger issue; right now my concern is with the way popular media sources present data.</span></p> <p><span>In 2010, I wrote an <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/10/25/news-opinion-networks-cable/\">article</a> that called for new standards for defining news versus opinion programming. \u00a0In that piece, I highlighted the dangers of the public misunderstanding news from opinion, and offered a potential solution: new standards, much like television ratings, that are displayed at the beginning of a program to highlight whether that particular programming is news or opinion programming. Those standards, I argued, should be determined by an unbiased third party, and continually revised if deemed appropriate.</span></p> <p><span>The Fox News chart I described above, however, got me thinking. Is there any way we can make the manner in which televisions programs display their data more transparent?</span></p> <p><span>We could, for example, require that a broadcast actually show a source\u2019s data rather than just displaying a citation. For example, should a broadcast display a chart based on a source\u2019s data, they would also display the chart used in the source document (or, if a chart is not used, a table of the source\u2019s data). This way, broadcasts can avoid instances such as the one above. With such changes as this, viewers would clearly see that a source\u2019s chart would look different than the one provided by the news source. Sure, there would be many more redundant charts broadcast on news programming, but I suspect that many \u201csimple\u201d errors would be eliminated this way.</span></p> <p><span>A more interesting and advanced way to improve the reliability of data on news programs involves the use of smartphone technology and audio tagging apps such as Shazam. Shazam identifies songs based on a few seconds of audio input. Now that there are more there are more American adults <a href=\"http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Smartphone-Update-2012/Findings.aspx\">who use smartphones</a> than more basic \u201cfeature\u201d phones, broadcasts could incorporate Shazam technology whenever they present data from a source. Viewers <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhumphrey/2012/02/05/shazam-yahoo-viggle-super-bowl-ads-sizzle-is-on-second-screen/\">could audio tag</a> that data through their Shazam app, taking the viewer directly to the source information that was used in the broadcast or related links based on the source information. Thus, viewers would have nearly instantaneous access to the source information right on their smartphones (or tablets, etc.), and can make their own decision as to whether the data was used accurately. Yes, this would require viewers to be more proactive, but it is an innovative way to improve media transparency radically.</span></p> <p><span>While these solutions do not get to the root problem of media bias, they are positive steps toward a more transparent set of guidelines for data usage. At a minimum, these solutions encourage a broader public debate on media transparency and how we can encourage more accurate use of data in broadcast programming. In their most powerful form however, these solutions represent the first steps towards a more factually accurate and transparent media industry that engages its viewers in a meaningful way.</span></p> <p><span><i>Rexhep Dollaku \u201913, a Crimson editorial writer, is a</i><i>n economics concentrator in Quincy House.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Warren and Obama: A Tenuous Relationship | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren found herself in the increasingly familiar confines of the national spotlight last week when she told the Washington Blade newspaper that she hoped President Barack Obama would \u201cevolve\u201d his views and endorse gay marriage.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI want to see the president evolve because I believe that is right; marriage equality is morally right,\u201d Warren said in an interview with the prominent LQBT weekly newspaper.</span></p> <p><span>Warren\u2019s comments came just days before the Obama campaign released 90 seconds of unused footage from the camp\u2019s documentary promotional \u201cThe Road We\u2019ve Traveled,\u201d in which the U.S. Senate candidate, and former advisor to the president, argues that Obama is best equipped to continue to pull the country out of the economic recession that marked his first term in office.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe president gets...what American families face,\u201d Warren says in the clip.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis election is going to affect everyone. We really have come to a real choice, and what our future looks like is going to be very different depending on who\u2019s governing,\u201d she adds.</span></p> <p><span>The seemingly contradictory intersection between the campaigns points to what has been an important, though at times fraught, relationship between the President and his former advisor\u2014one that helped launch Warren into political stardom and could have great effect on the political fates of both this fall, analysts here say.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn Massachusetts, his utility to her is enormous. He\u2019s so popular here that he is bound to have a positive effect on her and other Democrats,\u201d Democratic analyst Daniel B. Payne said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhere she might be valuable to Obama is among liberal donors who are increasingly becoming Democratic anyway. They may see her as someone who can vouch for Obama\u2019s credentials in trying to manage Wall Street excess,\u201d Payne added.</span></p> <p><span>Even as Warren criticized Obama for his positions on gay marriage last week, the President has incorporated many of Warren\u2019s ideas on consumer protection and the social contract into his own campaign rhetoric as he has tried to center his campaign on economic issues.</span></p> <p><span>Much of Obama\u2019s economic policy during his first term has roots in Warren and her scholarship. She was tapped first as the chair of the Congressional Oversight Committee charged with regulating the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), and then as an economic advisor to Obama responsible for creating a consumer protection agency.</span></p> <p><span>But despite her work in the White House, Warren was left out in the cold last summer when it came time for Obama to name the first director of the Consumer Protection Bureau\u2014an organization that she is recognized to have brought into being.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cShe lived up to the reputation\u2014a reputation that she made for herself\u2014as a rock thrower and that can make people in Washington quite nervous,\u201d Payne said. \u201cI think the fact that she was willing to be that blunt was both a blessing and curse for her.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The suggestion that Warren\u2019s criticism of Obama is based on hard feelings is improbable, analysts say. Instead, they posit that Warren is likely trying to push the President towards the more liberal stance that is popular within his party.</span></p> <p><span>Analysts say many of the differences in policy between the two camps can be attributed to the difference between the Massachusetts and national voting bodies.</span></p> <p><span>Experts warn Massachusetts has a history of splitting tickets, electing, for example, a Democratic president and a Republican senator. In other words, Warren may get a boost from her former boss, but she\u2019ll still have to win the race herself.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBarack Obama is going to win Massachusetts. So that\u2019s good for her, but it is not enough to guarantee her a win. That\u2019s going to help her but that\u2019s not going to close it for her,\u201d Democratic political consultant Mary Anne Marsh said.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, Obama may predict such a wide margin of victory in Massachusetts that he will not spend time campaigning here, and therefore avoid directly aiding Warren.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cGiven the fact that Obama is a shoo-in for winning Massachusetts, it seems to me that, unusual as it is, both Warren and Brown will have to play the turnout game even though its a presidential year,\u201d Kennedy School of Government lecturer M. Marty Linsky said.</span></p> <p><span>Analysts say Warren\u2019s effect on Obama may be more difficult to calculate in the long run, as it translates less clearly into tangible support.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf he wins and she wins they\u2019re going to be lifetime buddies, and what she says now is about her winning not about their relationship,\u201d Linsky said.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Nicholas P.

In contrast,\u00a0supporters have called Kim, an expert in global health and\u00a0development, an inspired pick who will add a vital new perspective to\u00a0the World Bank.</span></p> <p><span>The World Bank provides loans to developing countries in service of\u00a0its official goal of global poverty reduction. Its operations\u00a0primarily concern investment and finance, according to environmental\u00a0engineering and environmental health professor John Briscoe, who\u00a0served as the World Bank\u2019s country director for Brazil.</span></p> <p><span>Although the majority of World Bank leaders in the past came from\u00a0careers in finance and business, Kim\u2019s background is in the field of\u00a0public health. Along with Harvard Medical School professor Paul\u00a0Farmer, Kim co-founded Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit\u00a0that works to deliver primary and preventive health care to\u00a0underserved regions, in 1987.<img></span></p> <p><span>\u201cHealth is a small part, but not really central,\u201d said Briscoe of the\u00a0World Bank\u2019s mission. \u201c[Kim] has run a health organization which\u00a0survives on donations....This is a very important and admirable thing,\u00a0but it\u2019s entirely different from the mission of the World Bank.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kim\u2019s appointment, Briscoe said, would reduce the power of the U.S. to\u00a0shape the economic futures of developing nations, causing \u201cthe end of the World Bank as we\u2019ve known it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe World Bank is primarily a bank. It loans money to countries,\u00a0which [Kim] has no experience in,\u201d said one Harvard faculty member who\u00a0formerly worked for the World Bank and wished to remain anonymous. He\u00a0called the future of the World Bank \u201ca question mark,\u201d with the next\u00a0leader able to either strengthen its role as a lending institution or\u00a0transform it into a voice for other organizations to assume that\u00a0responsibility.</span></p> <p><span>He suggested that Kim, who has served as director of the HIV/AIDS\u00a0department of the World Health Organization, was nominated in part to\u00a0create popular political support for dealing with global health\u00a0problems and disparities between poor and rich countries.</span></p> <p><span>But supporters of Kim\u2019s nomination have argued that this global health\u00a0perspective will in fact help the World Bank focus on the most\u00a0important issues facing poorer countries.</span></p> <p><span>Julio Frenk, dean of the Harvard School of Public Health and former\u00a0minister of health of Mexico, said he was elated to learn of Kim\u2019s\u00a0nomination, calling it \u201ca great decision by President Obama.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[Kim\u2019s] nomination signals a very strong will to transform the bank\u00a0and fully devote it to become a leading development agency in the\u00a0world,\u201d said Frenk, who has worked extensively with the World Bank on\u00a0the topic of health systems.</span></p> <p><span>In contrast to the opponents of the nomination, Frenk said he believes\u00a0Kim\u2019s academic background and experience in global health will \u201cenrich\u00a0the work of the bank\u201d and convey needed changes to the international\u00a0financial institution.</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of the arguments on either side, Kim seems likely to secure\u00a0the post. Historically, the World Bank president has been an American\u00a0citizen, while the International Monetary Fund has been headed by a\u00a0European.</span></p> <p><span>Still, critics have argued that Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi\u00a0Okonjo-Iweala, the African nominee to the presidency, is more\u00a0qualified than Kim.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard Kennedy School Professor Lant Pritchett, who studies\u00a0international development and worked at the World Bank for 17 years,\u00a0publicly criticized Kim\u2019s nomination in a Forbes Magazine article on\u00a0Friday.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere is no way you can say with a straight face that this man is\u00a0more qualified to head the World Bank than Ngozi,\u201d he told Forbes.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:nkansra01@college.harvard.edu\">nkansra01@college.harvard.edu</a>.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Sabrina A.

To provide just <a href=\"http://eurodad.org/?p=4221\">one example</a> of how this sponsorship can backfire, the World Bank recently championed utility privatization in Ghana, despite findings by the United Nations that such measures actually increase poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Bank should take heed of the fact that a one-size-fits-all approach is clearly not appropriate to the complex issues afflicting the developing world, and be less aggressive in its support for liberal economic policies.</span></p> <p><span>Clearly, there is room for improvement at the World Bank, and Dr. Kim is uniquely positioned to make the most of it. Public health is a key area of World Bank involvement, and as a medical doctor, Dr. Kim will bring an important and unprecedented focus to the issue. He <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/24/business/global/dartmouth-president-is-obamas-pick-for-world-bank.html\">previously</a> spearheaded an impressive push to provide HIV treatment at the World Health Organization. In addition, his academic, as opposed to political, background will prove refreshing at the organization; he is less likely to be influenced by ideology than his <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/03/23/2710185/a-list-of-world-bank-presidents.html\">predecessors</a>, many of whom were business executives with extensive political ties. We hope that Dr. Kim will let practicality, rather than the desire to promote certain policies, guide his actions.</span></p> <p><span>In the future, we would like to see the World Bank led by someone from a developing country. American hegemony in this respect is one of the main complaints directed at the institution from developing countries. However, nationality is a far less important qualification than credentials, and Dr. Kim\u2019s past work demonstrates that he will prove a capable, and perhaps exemplary, president of the institution. We wish him well, and hope he has better luck eradicating world poverty than he did fighting <a href=\"http://www.ivygateblog.com/2010/05/creative-dartmouth-fratboys-snort-coke-off-of-their-brothers-photographed-faces-urinate-on-their-socks-destroy-their-tables-police-confused/\">cocaine use</a> at Dartmouth.</span></p>"}

{"title": "A Price Too High? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Many of the newly accepted prospective members of Harvard\u2019s Class of 2016 undoubtedly spent yesterday evening celebrating their admissions letters with their families. Today, they must begin to consider the more practical issues of college attendance, including cost. The Crimson has <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/26/tuition-costs-jump-up/\">reported</a> that next year, as in the past, Harvard\u2019s cost of attendance will increase. Cost of attendance, which has risen at a rate of between 3.5 and 4 percent for the past few years, will be $54,496 for the 2012-13 school year.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard has announced an accompanying increase in financial aid funding, increasing the amount available by 7.5 percent. Indeed, Harvard has stayed true to its conviction to make a Harvard education possible for everyone, even low-income families; its dedication to providing financial aid to a large percentage of students is impressive and commendable. However, Harvard\u2019s tuition increases follow a national pattern of tuition and fee hikes at both private and public colleges. As most universities do not have the resources to fund financial aid programs as expansive as Harvard\u2019s, these increases are alarming.</span></p> <p><span>Like our peers nationwide, we are worried about the increasing cost of higher education. A <a href=\"http://trends.collegeboard.org/downloads/College_Pricing_2011.pdf\">report</a> by the College Board notes that in the past decade, \u201cPublished tuition and fees at private nonprofit four-year institutions increased at an average rate of 2.6 percent per year beyond inflation.\u201d Over the same time period, tuition and fee rates at public four-year colleges and universities rose at an average of 5.6 percent a year beyond inflation for average out-of-state charges of $29,657 per year. To attend these universities, many students feel obligated to take out student loans; however, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303812904577295930047604846.html\">student debt</a> in America has now topped $1 trillion and students increasingly feel their post-graduate pursuits stymied by high levels of debt.</span></p> <p><span>As we have <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/1/harvard-obama-student-debt-action/\">noted before</a>, Obama recently came out with a commendable plan to address the rising cost of tuition at colleges across America. His project takes an important first step by providing a way for some students mired in debt to gain relief in the form of lower interest rates and by providing more information to prospective students about the affordability of college. Nonetheless, these policies can only be a first step; with the cost of higher education rising at such high rates, broader reform seems necessary.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, Harvard\u2019s own financial aid program generally provides most aid in the form of direct grants that do not have to be repaid. As students we are thankful that we can receive of the best financial aid in the country here; indeed, many of us would not be able to attend this institution if it were not for the generosity of Harvard\u2019s alumni donors and the concerted efforts by Harvard\u2019s Financial Aid Office to ensure that all students receive sufficient aid.</span></p> <p><span>For many high school students newly admitted to college, cost will be a large factor in deciding which university to attend. We hope that, through policies like Obama\u2019s recent plans for student loans, the government will ensure that college education remains accessible and affordable for American students. Beyond this, the Harvard Financial Aid Office should ensure that it continues to provide sufficient aid so that no member of Harvard\u2019s Class of 2016 is deterred from attendance for lack of funding.</span></p> <p><span><b>CORRECTION:</b> A previous version of this editorial stated that under the revised terms of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, financial aid is only guaranteed to families that earn up to $150,000 rather than the previous $180,000. Under the new policy, families earning above $150,000 are still likely to receive some aid.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Pointless Posturing | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Here we go again. President Mahmoud Ahmadinijad, Iran\u2019s stubborn and mercurial leader, is flaunting his country\u2019s military might in the face of growing international resentment. This time around the threat of conflict is more palpable than ever. Although the Iranian government insists that its nuclear constructs are for purely <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11709428\">civilian</a> purposes, recent actions do not lend credibility to this assertion. Ahmadinejad says he wishes to cooperate with the west, but his gestures have seemed more <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/8874152/Mahmoud-Ahmadinejad-accuses-Israel-and-US-as-tension-over-possible-strike-grows.html\">hawkish</a> than conciliatory. His supposed display of diplomacy becomes more farcical when the Iranian leader accuses the United States of trying to deter Iran\u2019s nuclear program in order to \u201csave the Zionist entity.\u201d Issuing such assertions does little to advance the dialogue between the sides\u2014after all, why would the \u201cZionist entity\u201d need to be saved if the nuclear program had only peaceful intent. Iranian leadership must come to the realization that pursuing its nuclear ambitions will bring no gains to its global sense of authority. Rather, the quest for the bomb is both economically and geopolitically debilitating for Iran.</span></p> <p><span><span> Ahmadinijad\u2019s rhetoric aside, what insights can one glean from Iran\u2019s economic interests? As it turns out, there is really only one to thing to note here: the </span><a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/index/country/iran\"><span>one-dimensional</span></a><span> nature of Iran\u2019s economy. Largely dependent on oil exports, it cannot expect to maintain its current economic trajectory without its most valuable resource. This is exactly why the sanctions imposed by the west carry so much weight. Obviously, a short term spike in oil prices is inevitable. Iran will do everything it can to inflict wallet shock on the western citizenry. This strategy, however, is unsustainable. In addition to the European oil embargo, the U.S. has frozen all central banking transactions with Iran. The west has effectively put the regime in a stranglehold, clenching the Iranian economy in a vice grip. Although the regime has considerable geopolitical leverage with its oil reserves, western economies can collectively take the hit from a blip in oil prices to force Tehran to yield. According to the U.S Energy Information Administration, Iran is not even among the United   States\u2019 </span><a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/energy_in_brief/foreign_oil_dependence.cfm\"><span>top</span></a><span> </span><span>five foreign sources of oil. Other options exist for the west in the short term. </span></span></p> <p><span><span>President Obama recently released a </span><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/apnewsbreak-source-says-obama-finds-global-oil-supply-ok-to-proceed-with-sanctions-on-iran/2012/03/30/gIQAivCWlS_story.html\"><span>statement</span></a><span> </span><span>reassuring U.S. allies that world markets have enough crude oil to allow the U.S. to proceed with imposing more sanctions on Iran. Even in an election year, the Obama administration has been steadfast and resolute in issuing sanctions. There is clearly a high enough level of confidence in alternative sources of oil, since the last thing Obama would invite is a Republican campaign focused on exorbitant gas prices. Furthermore, the International Energy Agency projects that the embargo will </span><a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-03-14/iran-s-crude-oil-exports-to-fall-50-percent-on-embargo-iea-says\"><span>slash</span></a><span> </span><span>Iran</span><span>\u2019s oil exports by 50 percent. The presence of energy alternatives gives the west the clear advantage in the game of chicken that Iran wants to play. So what economic incentives exist for Iran? To even the most jaded Iranian official, this all must be very clear. If Iran\u2019s leadership recognizes the blatant economic peril of losing oil revenue, it should make concessions.</span></span></p> <p><span><span> Along with the direct consequences of its actions, Iran must also concern itself with the more subtle outcomes of its policies. Its clandestine pursuit of a nuclear weapon will rattle the cages of many neighbors. As history </span><a href=\"http://the-diplomat.com/2011/10/01/south-asia%E2%80%99s-nuclear-arms-racing/\"><span>shows</span></a><span> us, acquiring nuclear capability has consistently proved to be a shock for the surrounding countries of armed nations, typically leading to a reassessment of relations. Iran is already short on allies in the region\u2014relying largly on the embattled Assad regime in Syria\u2014and making others wary is not a smart thing to do. Countries in the Middle East may cut off diplomatic proceedings with the nation, and impose sanctions of their own. Such regional instability, in the long term, will be a great cost to Iran. It is up to Ahmadinejad\u2019s discretion whether the benefit of annihilating its enemies on the basis of zealotry is worth this cost. </span></span></p> <p><span><span> The international community understands that it has limited options to deter a country hell bent on acquiring nuclear weapons. Diplomacy can only go so far when dealing with fringe leaders like Ahmadinijad. If only Iranian leadership could acknowledge that there are very few long-term benefits to building a nuclear weapon, the entire global community would be better off. Ahmadinejad and company have taken the narrowest of perspectives on the welfare of the nation. The Iranian people, many of whom are fed up with the direction of the country, will be the ones who pay the price of poor decision-making. All we can do is hope that the current situation does not reach such a prec<a></a>ipice. </span></span></p> <p><span><span> </span></span></p> <p><span><i><span>Sidhant Misra \u201914, a Crimson editorial writer, is an Economics concentrator in Leverett House. </span></i></span></p>"}

{"title": "Life, Liberty, and Birth Control? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Liberals would like to have you believe that the current debate over the freedom of religion in America is a battle over basic rights. While framing the debate, Obama and his allies have <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/15/contraception-mandate-sarah/\">falsely asserted</a> that this is not a battle for freedom of conscience but for a woman\u2019s right to contraception. Freedom of religion? It\u2019s something that liberals seem <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/10/us-usa-contraceptives-idUSTRE8181MX20120210\">willing to accommodate</a> as long as it is convenient\u2014never mind that it is the first freedom in the Bill of Rights. Here\u2019s an inconvenient truth: The right to contraception doesn\u2019t exist, nor should it.</span></p> <p><span>The progressive movement has grown over the past century by feeding off a false and absurd conception of rights. Realizing the extent of the government\u2019s power, progressive leaders from Franklin D. Roosevelt, class of 1904, to Lyndon B. Johnson claimed that people had rights not because they were human but because they had subordinated themselves to government. Instead of having a government to protect the rights of the people, they wanted a government to grant rights to the people. As a result, when liberals saw a program that they wanted to implement, they created a right to it. All of sudden, the American people have a right to their entitlements\u2014no matter how bankrupt Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid may be. Democrats wanted the government to take control of the health care market, so they granted the American people a right to health care. The <a href=\"http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/religious-liberty/conscience-protection/\">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services mandate</a> is just a continuation of the same concept: Democrats have created a right to abortion, sterilization, and contraception (but curiously, only for women). The government mandate is forcing religious institutions to pay for medical \u201ccare\u201d\u2014sterilization, abortifacients, and contraception\u2014that they have regarded as evil for thousands of years because policy makers decided that people have a right to these services.\u00a0Obama\u2019s misnamed \u201ccompromise\u201d does nothing to stop this violation of the freedom of religion. The \u201caccommodation\u201d merely requires insurance companies to provide the controversial services and then bill religious institutions for their costs. Either way, religious institutions are required to violate their conscience and pay for services they regard as evil.\u00a0 It is, <a href=\"http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2012/02/semantics-at-highest-level.html\">as Greg Mankiw has argued</a>, \u201csemantics at the highest level.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The problem with the progressive model is that it eventually creates a behemoth of unnatural rights unable to sustain itself without consuming the basic freedoms and natural rights of the American people. <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html\">The Declaration of Independence</a>, the foundation of our understanding of rights as American citizens, states, \u201cthat all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d These inalienable rights are part of our nature as human beings; as such, they cannot be taken away, nor can we voluntarily sacrifice them. The struggle for equality throughout the history of the United States has focused on rights <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2008/09/the-nature-of-rights-in-american-politics-a-comparison-of-three-revolutions\">because they are the foundation of equality</a>. Humans are equal not because they have the same abilities or character but because they have the same fundamental, inalienable rights. From the Emancipation Proclamation to Brown vs. Board of Education, some of the finest moments in American history have been the equal extension not of women\u2019s rights or minorities\u2019 rights, but of human rights to all people.</span></p> <p><span>Today, liberals in Washington are attempting to use the power of government to violate these very inalienable rights that they took an oath to defend. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/religious-right-now/post/rep-pelosi-conscience-is-more-than-a-thing/2011/12/06/gIQAUw7KZO_blog.html\">\u201cThis conscience thing\u201d</a> that Nancy Pelosi has dismissed as an irrational obsession of conservatives is in fact what James Madison called the \u201cthe most sacred of all property\u201d and what Jefferson argued was guaranteed by \u201cthe principles of the Constitution and the government of the United States.\u201d To violate the natural rights of the American people in order to secure the deluge of absurd progressive \u201crights\u201d is to reject the foundation of equality and liberty. No one in the Republican Party or the Catholic Church has argued that women should be prohibited from using contraception. What they do object to is the violation of the freedom to practice their religion and participate in civil society because the government decided to create a women\u2019s right to contraception and abortion. No American should be forced not to practice medicine, educate students, contribute to charity, or participate in American civil society because of his religious beliefs. We are all humans with natural rights first and citizens second.</span></p> <p><span>The debate over the HHS mandate is not a debate about the morality of birth control, sterilization, and abortion. It\u2019s a dispute over the extent to which government can violate the natural rights of its citizens. Not long after our own revolution, the French attempted to create a social contract under which the individual ceded all rights and powers to the state in order to be \u201cfree.\u201d Things didn\u2019t turn out well, to say the least. Unfortunately, history seems apt to repeat itself, and when liberals stop misrepresenting the debate, perhaps they\u2019ll recognize exactly where we\u2019re headed.

{"title": "One Way to Enjoy Art | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The only thing that has stuck for a decade in my memory from Edith Nesbit\u2019s classic novel \u201cFive Children and It\u201d is the set of instructions on how to will yourself into waking up at a certain hour. \u201cYou get into bed at night,\u201d Nesbit writes, \u201cand lie down quite flat on your little back with your hands straight down by your sides. Then you say \u2018I must wake up at five\u2019 (or six, or seven, or eight, or nine, or whatever the time is that you want), and as you say it you push your chin down on to your chest and then bang your head back on the pillow. And you do this as many times as there are ones in the time you want to wake up at. (It is quite an easy sum.)\u201d</span></p> <p><span>I remember being skeptical of this system as a 12 year-old\u2014was Nesbit trying to make a joke at the expense of her \u201clittle\u201d readers? But over the years, I discovered that if I thought concertedly about the time I needed to get up the following morning, I often woke up a few minutes before my alarm clock, no matter how irregular the hours I was keeping. Apparently, you can will yourself into waking up when you need to, along with the proven facts that you can will yourself into a better mood by smiling, and that you can will yourself into believing a placebo will help you even when you know it\u2019s a placebo. I also think that you can will yourself into finding the exact piece of art that you\u2019ve been looking for, knowingly or not.</span></p> <p><span>Two summers ago, due to a flight-planning error, I had a day to pass in London with absolutely nothing to do. I ended up going for an all-day walk, mostly because all the Underground stations were being fixed up for the Olympics. My backpack was heavy, and my walk was aimless and depressing. I was alone and had no money to speak of\u2014I ate four toffee-flavored yogurts because they were on sale. I walked to the palace, along the river, to the Tate Modern, and up to the Brick Lane area, where I found a lot of beautiful full-mink stoles that I didn\u2019t have the money to buy. Finally, evening was falling, and I could start heading to the airport where I was to spend the night.</span></p> <p><span>I had just turned westward and begun the slog from Brick Lane to King\u2019s Cross when I found, along a wide, gray street, a wall of paintings by Ben Eine, the alphabet-obsessed street artist whose work British Prime Minster David Cameron had recently presented to Barack Obama. Following Eine\u2019s letters, I found a massive weasel painted by another famous street artist, Roa, whose intensely detailed, morbid, textural, drawing-like depictions of rodents and birds had been cycling through my Google Reader for years. The weasel did not look like an etching, the way Roa\u2019s pieces look online. I could see the powdery sweep of the fine-nozzled black spray can. I was just as tall as its stomach.</span></p> <p><span>Though the beating heart of street art is its accessibility and its rejection of all kinds of formal art institutions, from schools to galleries, the works\u2019 indivisibility from their places of creation makes them even more elusive to enjoy in person than even the most elite painting. Seen live, the weasel was beautiful, monstrous, and totally unmanageable\u2014the kind of megafauna that prehistoric humans killed off as they developed more advanced missile technology. I could not contain my excitement and exclaimed about the piece to passersby. Looking at the Roa in the twilight did not suddenly bring my life into focus for me. It did not diminish any grander site that I had seen earlier in the city. It was not the symbol of my travels, or anything else. But it was a powerful experience.</span></p> <p><span>I think that one possible key to enjoying art is allowing yourself to accept what you see, the way you would accept the 7:58 that you see on your clock upon waking when you have set your alarm to ring at 8:00. Let art be something that contains the force of that personal will. Street art like Roa\u2019s weasel, which requires some kind of wandering and stumbling upon, is particularly apt for this kind of discovery. Art always anticipates, and it will be there when you wake. Enjoying art is an act of will: You meet it halfway with hope, and it will repay you many times over.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Columnist Molly E.

{"title": "The President Declares War | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Politics in America have officially become destructive. Polarization and heated political rhetoric may have been unpleasant last year, but in 2012, the brute ambition of the Machiavellian prince has emerged roaring from behind the curtain, and he\u2019s ready to destroy. With the Obama administration\u2019s decision to force certain religious employers to provide health care coverage for all Food and Drug Administration approved-contraceptives, sterilization procedures, and other controversial services, Obama has officially declared war against liberty.</span></p> <p><span>Contrary to what some have argued, the contraceptive mandate is not contingent on the insurance provider receiving public funding. <a href=\"http://blog.heritage.org/2012/02/01/obamacares-contraception-mandate-tramples-on-religious-liberty/?utm_source=Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=Morning%2BBell\">The statute applies to every health insurance provider in the country</a>. As such, religious institutions not granted exemptions are forced to either stop providing health coverage (and face a stiff penalty under the law) or violate their religious convictions. On this issue, however, the First Amendment to the Constitution leaves little room for ambiguity: \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d By forcing religious institutions to provide contraceptives and procedures that they have consistently regarded as evil, the Obama administration has effectively reduced the free exercise of religion to the freedom to worship. They have ordered Americans to leave their beliefs and principles at the altar. The mandate is an order to choose between one\u2019s soul and one\u2019s government, and despite what Obama may believe, a soul is far more precious than a government. Who you are is far more important than who your government orders you to be.</span></p> <p><span>The contraceptive mandate is a blow not only to religion but also to civil society. By only exempting houses of worship but not other religious institutions from the mandate, the administration has decreed that religion and religious values are no longer welcome in civil society. In reality, religion is a major foundation of civil society. Throughout the history of the United States, religious institutions have provided critical aid to the poor, homes for orphans, and education for students. A personal belief is something that one acts upon: a religious call to care for the poor drives one to volunteer one\u2019s time, talent, and treasure to charity. To order Catholic and other religious institutions to cover abortifacients and contraceptives is to order them to violate their beliefs. James Madison, author of much of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, argued, <a href=\"http://usccb.org/about/media-relations/resources/wall-street-journal-op-ed-on-religious-freedom.cfm\">\u201cconscience is the most sacred of all property.\u201d</a> If the government can control one\u2019s conscience, there remains nothing outside of its reach.</span></p> <p><span>The worst of it is the fact that the Obama administration and its allies remain indifferent to what they have done. After the thundering condemnation of the mandate from multiple religious leaders and religious freedom advocates, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/boehner-feds-should-back-off-order-for-many-religious-employers-to-cover-contraception/2012/02/02/gIQAXVvbkQ_story.html\">the White House's only response</a> was that \u201cthe issue here is we want to be sure women, all women, have access to good health care.\u201d Even if one believed this was good health care policy, it fails to explain why the president has the authority to explicitly violate the basic freedoms of the Bill of Rights. <a href=\"http://www.fox11online.com/dpp/news/local/green_bay/catholic-churches-rail-against-hhs-mandate\">Planned Parenthood attacked the response of Catholic bishops</a>: \u201cThey are in the very small minority who believe this is a bad policy, and the majority of men and women think they should have access to birth control through their health coverage.\u201d The Constitution and fundamental rights do not depend on popular opinion; if they did, federal judges would be elected, not appointed. By refusing to defend its Constitutional position, President Obama has effectively recognized that he remains indifferent towards the fundamental rights of America\u2019s citizens. Lincoln once famously asked, \u201cWas it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the Constitution?\u201d Obama is asking whether it is possible to lose the Constitution and yet preserve his electoral base.</span></p> <p><span>In 2012, America faces more than a choice between political parties and tax rates. The polarized American electorate must collectively resolve a crisis in government. Under President Obama, liberalism has transformed government from the protector of rights to the granter of tolerance. The problem is that, while rights are inalienable, tolerance can be taken away. Now that the tolerance for religion has been revoked, religious leaders face the crushing power of the state, imposing its liberal views on any institution that dares step in its way. The president and his supporters have officially declared executive authority over religion. In 2012, the American voter must decide whether he wishes to complete the path to serfdom. The price will be our freedom.</span></p> <p><span><i>Derek J. Bekebrede \u201913 is an economics concentrator in Winthrop House. His column appears on alternate Tuesdays.</i></span></p>"}

{"title": "The Persistence of Racial Politics | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Considering Mitt Romney\u2019s comparative lack of <a href=\"http://politicalwire.com/archives/2011/12/06/romney_declines_trump_debate.html\">deference</a> to Donald Trump earlier in the campaign, it may come as a surprise that last week Trump deigned to anoint Romney with his blessing for the Republican nomination. In the 24 hours before the announcement, <a href=\"http://politicalwire.com/archives/2012/02/01/trump_plans_major_announcement.html\">rumors</a> had surfaced that Trump would throw his weight behind Newt Gingrich.\u00a0 Yet it was Romney, not Gingrich, who appeared with Trump at a press conference in Las   Vegas. The newfound political relationship between Romney and Trump offers a glimpse into the likely shape of the campaign against incumbent President Barack Obama.\u00a0\u00a0 The attacks against the president\u2019s policy agenda will be overshadowed by tacitly racist attempts to undermine the president\u2019s authenticity as an American.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, both Trump and Romney have emphasized Obama\u2019s ethnic and racial background. Trump single-handedly turned himself into a political figure by feeding baseless fears about the President\u2019s supposed Kenyan <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/apr/10/trump-rides-issue-of-presidents-birth/?page=all\">birth</a>.\u00a0 Similarly, the Romney campaign has made it a point to stoke the flames of suspicion about the President\u2019s supposed lack of American authenticity. At a <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/Boston/politicalintelligence/2012/02/mitt-romney-accuses-barack-obama-not-understanding-the-american-spirit/CQtjrmkBNd4ycHljgpAXNI/index.html\">rally</a> in Las Vegas last week, Romney accused Obama of not \u201cfeeling\u2026this American spirit\u201d that \u201cwe share.\u201d He said that Obama is intent on \u201cpoisoning the spirit of America\u201d and \u201creplacing ambition with envy.\u201d Such accusations serve as a dog-whistle aimed at those whose xenophobia and, yes, racism, has led them to be suspicious of the President not just for his policies but also for his identity.\u00a0 The likes of Romney and Trump have sought to both further and benefit from the American right\u2019s vestigial racism.</span></p> <p><span>The right wing of the Republican Party\u2019s reliance on racial fear to excite its base has deep, well-documented roots. In 1968, the Nixon campaign sought to capitalize on the Democrats\u2019 decision to go all-in on civil rights by launching the now-infamous \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/books/phillips-southern.pdf\">Southern Strategy</a>.\u201d This strategy consisted of playing to Southern white fears about lawlessness in the wake of integration. It meant providing open arms to racists fleeing a Democratic party <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/books/phillips-southern.pdf\">overtaken</a> by \u201cnegroes and Jews.\u201d As a result of the race-baiting tactics of his campaign, Nixon was the first member of the Republican Party to establish an electoral base in the South since Reconstruction.\u00a0 In 1981, Republican strategist Lee <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6DF1E30F935A35753C1A9639C8B63\">Atwater</a> explained in not-so-subtle terms that the politicians of his party spoke in \u201ccoded\u201d language with regards to \u201cthe racial problem.\u201d By the Reagan era, talk of so-called welfare queens and luxurious government handouts evoked racial stereotypes to arouse the fear of bigots.\u00a0 Atwater went on to lead George H.W. Bush\u2019s 1988 campaign, which included the racially charged <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/opinion/20sat3.html\">Willie Horton Ad.</a></span></p> <p><span>Certainly racism in America has dissipated significantly, even since the late \u201880\u2019s. However, it is fanciful to imagine that after centuries of explicit racial politics, the specter of bigotry is entirely absent from our discourse.\u00a0 Indeed, Trump harps on the bizarre notion that President Obama was born in Africa, and Romney asserts that Obama does not \u201cbelieve in America.\u201d Attacks against the President that rely on the implication that he is un-American do little to end the malignant tradition of racism in politics.</span></p> <p><span>These on the right often offer an ungenerous critique of so-called \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d opting instead to speak bluntly and plainly.\u00a0 Well, it\u2019s time we tear down the greatest monument to wrongheaded political correctness in America.\u00a0 We must end the charade that places a taboo on acknowledging the existence of racial politics.</span></p> <p><span>The Birther movement, entirely bereft of a factual basis, was the offspring of the latent racial animus that still exists in this country.\u00a0 By last spring, it became widespread enough that denying the President\u2019s natural-born citizenship became de rigueur for all aspiring conservative presidential candidates. I admire the optimism of those who genuinely believe that the tradition of the \u201cSouthern Strategy\u201d has been entirely erased in the last forty years, but I do not share it.\u00a0 It is not a mere coincidence that our first black president is also the first one whose American nationality has been called into question.\u00a0 It is not a coincidence that our first black president is the only one whose <a href=\"http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1701/poll-obama-muslim-christian-church-out-of-politics-political-leaders-religious\">religious identity</a> is the subject of persistent doubt.</span></p> <p><span>In the 2008 campaign, John McCain had the maturity to publicly <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/10/mccain-walks-it-back-obam_n_133773.html\">dismiss</a> claims that Obama was a secret Muslim.\u00a0 Unfortunately, I expect no such thing from Romney. He has shown himself incapable of connecting meaningfully with voters.\u00a0 His road to the Republican nomination has been one of sad resignation for the Republican base rather than excitement. Furthermore, his entire narrative will fall apart if unemployment continues to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/04/business/economy/us-economy-added-243000-jobs-in-january-unemployment-rate-is-8-3.html?hp\">fall</a>. His best chance at capturing the Oval Office rests in rousing deep, unfounded fears about the President\u2019s identity.\u00a0 I do not think that Mitt Romney is racist, nor do I think he doubts the President\u2019s place of birth.\u00a0 Yet Romney apparently wants the presidency badly enough to sing any tune, play to any fear, and stand on stage with any would-be demagogue for a few votes.\u00a0 I, for one, maintain no illusions about the pitch of his dog whistle.</span></p> <p><span><i>Michael F.

While Goldman has an admirable <a href=\"http://www2.goldmansachs.com/who-we-are/diversity-and-inclusion/recruiting/index.html\">diversity recruiting program</a> for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender people and other groups traditionally excluded from Wall Street, hiring practices are just one of many fields where a corporation may have a social impact. Looking at its broader impact on LGBT rights and other forms of inequality, it is clear that Goldman Sachs is blatantly undeserving of the Corporate Equality award. Furthermore, HRC\u2019s decision to give Goldman this award is a telling indictment of an organization increasingly at odds with queer activists across the country.</span></p> <p><span><a href=\"http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/HRC/exhibition/whatishrc/index.html\">The HRC</a> was founded in 1980 \u201cto provide financial support on behalf of the gay and lesbian community to candidates... who pledge their support of gay civil rights legislation.\u201d However, Goldman Sachs has supported conservative politicians who oppose LGBT equality. For example, Goldman\u2019s employees have been the <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-02-02/goldman-sachs-joins-wall-street-to-fund-romney-over-obama.html\">largest financial supporters</a> of Governor Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign, despite his <a href=\"http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=18683\">opposition to marriage equality</a> and his <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/12/12/143590615/romney-stance-on-gay-rights-issues-its-complicated\">ending Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell</a>. The Obama administration, on the other hand, has <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/09/20/statement-president-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell\">repealed Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell</a>, refused to defend the federal <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/19/obama-defense-of-marriage-gay-rights_n_903680.html\">government\u2019s ban on same sex marriage</a>, and made <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/07/gay-rights-us-aid-criteria\">protection of LGBT rights abroad</a> a part of U.S. foreign policy. By promoting Romney instead of Obama, Goldman employees are using their wealth to fight against LGBT equality.</span></p> <p><span>Goldman Sachs cannot be a meaningful political ally for LGBT equality because its position to profit from conservative economic policies will almost always place them at odds with candidates promoting LGBT equality. Clearly, corporate influence is too strong at the HRC when it is giving special recognition to a corporation that works against its original mission. In addition to Goldman, other <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/the-hrc-story/corporate-partners\">major corporate sponsors of HRC</a> include Bank of America, Citi, Chase, and Morgan Stanley.</span></p> <p><span>More deeply, Goldman Sachs is unworthy of the Corporate Equality award because it has produced and perpetuated economic, gender, and racial inequality through irresponsible financial practices. But why should economic, gender, racial, and economic inequality matter at all to the Human Rights Campaign? The simplest reason is that there are LGBT people of all races, genders, and classes, and the HRC cannot expect support from people whom it liberates in some ways but oppresses in others.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, HRC claims to promote LGBT rights as a part of human rights more generally. Its <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/the-hrc-story/mission-statement\">mission statement</a> declares that HRC strives to \u201crealize a nation that achieves fundamental fairness and equality for all.\u201d Branding LGBT equality as a human right is a strategic tool for building consensus and legitimacy around LGBT rights. However, this framework cannot be used if the HRC fails to respect the broader human rights agenda\u2014which is exactly what honoring Goldman Sachs has accomplished. Clearly, this organization must implement many changes before it can deserve the name Human Rights Campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Honoring Goldman Sachs means honoring a bank whose financial abuses have disproportionately hurt low-income and non-white Americans. Goldman played a pivotal role in the creation of the financial crisis, employing credit default swaps to create <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/banks-bet-greece-defaults-on-debt-they-helped-hide/\">toxic debts in Greece</a> and <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2010/04/24/news/companies/Goldman_Senate_documents/index.htm\">toxic mortgages</a> in the USA while betting against the odds of repayment in order to <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/banks-bet-greece-defaults-on-debt-they-helped-hide/\">derive profit from the ensuing collapse</a>. Goldman directly hurt the working class through <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/01/goldman-sachs-robo-signing-regulator_n_944622.html\">wrongful home foreclosures</a>, kicking people out of their homes without even conducting the required review of case files. Furthermore, the foreclosure crisis exacerbated racial inequalities, with black and Latino families <a href=\"http://www.responsiblelending.org/mortgage-lending/research-analysis/Lost-Ground-2011.pdf\">almost three times more likely to lose their homes</a> than white families.</span></p> <p><span>Honoring Goldman Sachs also means honoring a workplace environment where racial and gender inequality run rampant. Christina Chen-Oster, a former vice-president who spent eight years at Goldman, filed a <a href=\"http://articles.businessinsider.com/2010-09-15/wall_street/29997198_1_gender-bias-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-goldman-sachs-today\">class action discrimination lawsuit</a> against Goldman in 2010 with two other female employees. She reported pervasive workplace sexism and racism at Goldman, including an instance when she had to use physical force to stop unwanted sexual advances from a coworker while walking home from a company-funded visit to a strip club.</span></p> <p><span>Sadly, the decision to honor Goldman Sachs is the norm rather than the exception for HRC. Astonishingly, the HRC <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/award-for-workplace-equality-innovation\">also gave the 2011 Workplace Equality award</a> to Goldman Sachs. By failing to look outside Wall Street, HRC has demonstrated that it is uninterested in workplace equality outside of the outrageously wealthy financial firms that help fund their organization.</span></p> <p><span>Many working class Americans fear disclosing their sexual orientation or gender identity at work knowing they could fall into poverty if they are fired. But HRC continues to focus single-mindedly on LGBT equality on Wall Street, whose employees are rich and protected by <a href=\"http://www.prideagenda.org/Issues-Explained/Sexual-Orientation-Non-Discrimination-Act.aspx\">state</a> and <a href=\"http://www.transgenderlaw.org/ndlaws/index.htm#maps\">city laws</a> <a href=\"http://www.transgenderlaw.org/ndlaws/index.htm#maps\">against anti-LGBT discrimination</a>. However, in most parts of America it is <a href=\"http://sites.hrc.org/sites/passendanow/index.asp\">still perfectly legal</a> to fire someone because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. It would be much more meaningful for HRC to reward pioneers standing up for LGBT equality where it is not legally protected rather than to reward Goldman Sachs for meeting expectations.</span></p> <p><span>By focusing on this incredibly privileged group of Wall Street employees, HRC is ignoring the needs of normal LGBT people. Awards like the Corporate Equality award enable Goldman Sachs to create a false image of social responsibility while continuing to perpetuate inequality in all of its forms. However, LGBT activists with a social conscience have responded quickly, organizing <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/06/human-rights-campaigns-ne_n_1257566.html\">protests in NYC</a> and <a href=\"http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2012/02/queer-activists-want-sachs.html\">San Francisco</a> as well as a petition on <a href=\"http://www.change.org/petitions/hrc-theres-no-honor-for-goldman-sachs\">change.org</a>. The whole debacle has ultimately served to implicate HRC for supporting Wall Street abuses and has solidified HRC as an organization that has lost any memory of what the fight for equality is all about.</span></p> <p><span><i>Samuel J.

Bolman \u201915 sat down to discuss the Occupy movement, pop culture, and modern academia.</i></span></p> <p><span><b>Fifteen Minutes: </b>What is the role of academia at an institution like Harvard in the current global crisis?</span></p> <p><span><b> </b></span></p> <p><span><b>Slavoj \u017di\u017eek</b>: What is crucial and also I think\u2014especially today, when we have some kind of re-emergence of at least some kind of practical spirit, protest, and so on\u2014one of the dangers I see amongst some radical academia circles is this mistrust in theory, you know, saying, \u201cWho needs fat books on Hegel and logic? My god, they have to act!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>No, I think quite on the contrary. More than ever, today it\u2019s crucial to emphasize that on the one hand, yes, every empirical example undermines theory. There are no full examples. But, point two, this does not mean that we should turn the examples against theory. At the same time, there is no exception. There are no examples outside theories. Every example of a theory is an indication of the inner split dynamics of the theory itself, and here dialectics begins, and so on....</span></p> <p><span>Don\u2019t fall into the trap of feeling guilty, especially if you have the luck of studying in such a rich place. All this bullshit like, \u201cSomalian children are starving....\u201d No! Somalian children are not starving because you have a good time here. There are others who are much more guilty. Rather, use the opportunity. Society will need more and more intellectual work. It\u2019s this topic of intellectuals being privileged\u2014this is typical petty-bourgeois manipulation to make you feel guilty. You know who told me the best story? The British Marxist, Terry Eagleton. He told me that 20 or 30 years ago he saw a big British Marxist figure, Eric Hobsbawm, the historian, giving a talk to ordinary workers in a factory. Hobsbawm wanted to appear popular, not elitist, so he started by saying to the workers, \u201cListen, I\u2019m not here to teach you. I am here to exchange experiences. I will probably learn more from you than you will from me.\u201d Then he got the answer of a lifetime. One ordinary worker interrupted him and said, \u201cFuck off! You are privileged to study, to know. You are here to teach us! Yes, we should learn from you! Don\u2019t give us this bullshit, \u2018We all know the same.\u2019 You are elite in the sense that you were privileged to learn and to know a lot. So of course we should learn from you. Don\u2019t play this false egalitarianism.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Again, I think there is a certain strategy today even more, and I speak so bitterly about it because in Europe they are approaching it. I think Europe is approaching some kind of intellectual suicide in the sense that higher education is becoming more and more streamlined. They are talking the same way communists were talking 40 years ago when they wanted to crush intellectual life. They claimed that intellectuals are too abstract in their ivory towers; they are not dealing with real problems; we need education so that it will help real people\u2014real societies\u2019 problems. And then, again, in a debate I had in France, some high politician made it clear what he thinks and he said...in that time in France there were those demonstrations in Paris, the car burnings. He said, \u201cLook, cars are burning in the suburbs of Paris: We don\u2019t need your abstract Marxist theories. We need psychologists to tell us how to control the mob. We need urban planners to tell us how to organize the suburbs to make demonstrations difficult.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But this is a job for experts, and the whole point of being intellectual today is to be more than an expert. Experts are doing what? They are solving problems formulated by others. You know, if a politician comes to you, \u201cFuck it! Cars are burning! Tell me what\u2019s the psychological mechanism, how do we dominate it?\u201d No, an intellectual asks a totally different question: \u201cWhat are the roots? Is the system guilty?\u201d An intellectual, before answering a question, changes the question. He starts with, \u201cBut is this the right way to formulate the question?\u201d</span></p> <p><span><b>FM: </b>You spoke at Occupy Wall Street a few months ago. What is your personal involvement with the Occupy Wall Street movement, and what do you think the protests signify?</span></p> <p><span><b>SZ</b>: None. My personal involvement was some guy who was connected with it, and he told me, \u201cWould you go there, come there?\u201d And I said, \u201cOkay. Why not?\u201d Then the same guy told me,\u201cBe careful, because microphones are prohibited, you know, it\u2019s this echoing, repeating.\u201d So my friend told me, frankly, to be demagogic: \u201cJust try to be as much as possible effective, short, slow,\u201d and so on, and that was it. I didn\u2019t even drop my work.</span></p> <p><span>What does [Occupy] mean? Then they tell you, \u201cOh, Wall Street should work for the Main Street, not the opposite,\u201d but the problem is not this. The problem is that the system stated that there is no Main Street without Wall Street. That is to say that banking and credits are absolutely crucial for the system to function today. That is why I understand Obama when\u2014two years ago you know when the first, I think it was, $750 billion and a bit more\u2014it was simply blackmail and it was not possible to say no because that\u2019s how the system functions. If Wall Street were to break down, everything would break. We should think more radically. So again, the formula \u201cGive money to Main Street and not to Wall Street\u201d is ruined. That is to say, all these honest, hardworking people who do their jobs cannot find work now. Think how to change <i>that</i>. Think how to change [the] mechanisms of <i>that</i>. We are no longer dealing with short-term crises like in 2008.</span></p> <p><span><b>FM:</b> Why do you believe that the Right and the Left in America have failed to provide answers to the problems of inequality and the crises they predict?</span></p> <p><span><b>SZ</b>: It\u2019s crazy but I\u2019m convinced about it: look at the last two seasons of \u201c24.\u201d Look closely, something very interesting happens. It\u2019s not only superficial, political correctness. In season seven, Jack Bauer investigates some Muslim attacks and then he discovers it\u2019s not Muslims at all: it\u2019s some American mega-security company who is manipulating these attacks. Something much more tragic happened in the last season, which I quite liked. It\u2019s that, at the end, Jack Bauer breaks out of this authoritarian logic. Somebody has to do the dirty job, torturing, and so on. He says, \u201cMaybe I should say it publicly, everything, I cannot live with it.\u201d So this logic of \u201cThe true heroes are those who are ready to do the dirty job\u2014torture for the country,\u201d \u00a0it breaks down. His liberal counterpoint, the president, Allison Taylor, also breaks down and has to quit. So that, at the end, you get a very honest assessment of a deadlock and the message is: within the present global systemic coordinates, whatever you do, you end up in a deadlock. I think this honest confrontation with the ethical deadlock is much more valuable than the Hollywood Left \u201cfeel-good\u201d attitude of movies like <i>Pelican Brief</i> or <i>All the President\u2019s Men</i>, which may appear radical in their accusation: \u201cOh my god, even the President of the United States can be corrupted blah blah blah.\u201d Nonetheless, these are all \u201cfeel-good\u201d movies because at the end the final message is: \u201cWow, what a great country! Two ordinary guys can overthrow the mightiest man in the world!\u201d If I were to choose between this Leftist, liberal <i>All the President\u2019s Men</i> or Jack Bauer, I [would] choose Jack Bauer every day. I\u2019m sorry to tell you. Because it does what honest conservatives want\u2014not reactionaries: reactionaries are stupid, they think if we go back to lost values, it will work. Liberals are stupid progressives. What we can learn from honest conservatives is that they are ready to accept a deadlock.</span></p> <p><span>For example, Marx said about Balzac: precisely as a conservative, Balzac depicted the deadlock of French society. Even [American political scientist] Francis Fukuyama, he no longer believes in this bullshit \u201cend of history.\u201d He told me that the very fact of the possibility of biogenetic manipulations makes his thesis on the \u201cend of history\u201d obsolete. And he thinks that to cope with this problem we need much stronger forms of social control, which liberal-democratic capitalism cannot provide. This is what I like and this is what we can learn from honest conservatives: they don\u2019t bullshit you. And maybe this is the duty of us intellectuals. You know when people ask me on Wall Street, \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d I was so embarrassed because, fuck you, what do I know? I don\u2019t. But what we should do is simply break the rules in the sense of opening new space.\u00a0[The world is] confused as it is, always, from Wall Street to Egypt. Nonetheless, it is opening up space. People are becoming aware. It\u2019s the first move, but nonetheless, we have to start to think about some kind of radical change. All these Leftist, liberal things\u2014more gay rights, more abortion\u2014of course we fight for that, but that\u2019s not enough. Ironically, when I was young, we were dreaming about <i>socialism</i> with a human face; these guys are offering us <i>global capitalism</i> with a human face. It\u2019s the same system but a little bit more.... We have to break this taboo, which was very strong until now: nobody even dared to imagine an alternative. Everyone was, in a way as I say, a Fukuyamist. Even radicals, we somehow accept that global capitalism and liberal democracy are here to stay, and the point is only to make the system a little bit more efficient. No, it is clear we have to start thinking.</span></p> <p><span>And this is a great responsibility, because of course there is no way back to the glories of 20th century communism. No, but that\u2019s our duty at this point, just to open up the field and, at the same time, to undermine, break. We have to be very destructive at this point, destructive in the sense of breaking false illusions....</span></p> <p><span>Who would have expected the Arab Spring, or whatever you call it? It did happen. Who would have expected these big demonstrations in Europe that are occurring? They are happening. People at the beginning thought, \u201cOh this is something that will explode.\u201d No, it goes on. There is a tremendous potential in dissatisfaction. But again, this is always a potential danger.</span></p> <p><span><b>FM:</b> It seems that a similar deadlock appears in the context of both the economic crisis and global warming\u2014experts can\u2019t seem to predict them, nor will politicians or society act to stop them.</span></p> <p><span><b>SZ</b>: I especially hate, from my own experience, when people say, \u201cOh, who could have predicted this [economic crisis]?\u201d No. I know a couple of leftists and empiricists who <i>exactly</i> predicted this. These are not the kinds of cheap catastrophists who all of the time give bad predictions and then something happens so that they go awry. No, no. They were very precise and predicted <i>this</i> crisis. Paul Krugman said something deeply true. A guy asked him, \u201cBut now that we know, wouldn\u2019t things be radically different if we were to know 10 years back what we know now?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, no, it wouldn\u2019t. The system pushes you to act in a certain way.\u201d The illusion is much stronger. Like, you may know that there may be a catastrophe, but nonetheless, we would have done exactly the same thing. I mean, it\u2019s no longer a question of knowledge. Today many, even sociologists, have this wonderful idea of how, although we live in a society of knowledge\u2014even scientific knowledge\u2014[it] is becoming more and more contingent, non-binding. I think it was the German theorist Ulrich Beck who drew attention to the simple fact: today we speak about expert opinions. Are we aware how paradoxical this term is? The idea is that we ordinary people have opinions. They tell you the truth. Now experts all of a sudden are telling us different opinions and we have to decide how, who knows, if even they don\u2019t know. This is the tragedy of our predicament of freedom of choice. The problem is...we are often forced to choose without having serious cognitive coordinates of how or what to choose.... The price is that science is no longer a homogenous science but it\u2019s turning into kind of a pluralistic field of opinions.</span></p> <p><span>For example, I once had a debate with a quantum physicist. And he accused me, \u201cYou stupid guys with your French theory, total bullshit.\u201d He made fun precisely of this: \u201cYou can just say whatever you want.\u201d And I told him, \u201cFuck you! Look at quantum physics: literally anything goes. You can claim that there is a Big Bang, that there is no Big Bang, there were multiple Big Bangs\u2026\u201d It\u2019s incredible how, when science approaches a certain limit, how open it becomes. It\u2019s as if anything you can imagine, you find scientists who advocate. I\u2019m not saying science is just laughable. It is real. I\u2019m just saying how difficult it is to <i>decide</i> today without a proper cognitive base. We are more and more compelled to this.</span></p> <p><span>Andre Depui said that the problem when people say, \u201cOh but we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really global warming.\u201d The problem is that if you want to wait until we really know, it will be, by definition, too late. Because we will really know when the catastrophe is here. This is maybe one of the great things that has to be decided as a specific problem\u2014in Germany there were working with certain proponents of risk society\u2014how to decide some basic rules of decision-making in situations that are cognitively non-transparent. You have to decide because not doing anything is also a decision. You have to decide, but you don\u2019t know. The situation is not transparent.</span></p> <p><span><b>FM: </b>Thank you so much for the interview. Can we get a photo with you?</span></p> <p><span><b>SZ: </b>Okay, okay. But I hate my stupid face. Oh, this photo will look like something that should be titled \u201cDumb and Dumber.\u201d Ugh, my stupid face. It\u2019s horrible, just horrible.

Even after a $1 trillion investment, Iraq simply cannot compete with the latest slate of domestic and international politics, especially among a populace weary of an iota of Iraq-related news. Unfortunately, while Americans wear self-imposed blinders, Iraq relapses, and this time, America\u2019s reduced leverage leaves her futilely crossing her fingers.</span></p> <p><span><a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/22/world-report-2012-strengthen-support-arab-spring\">Human Rights Watch</a> recently referred to Iraq as a \u201cbudding police state,\u201d though the \u201cbudding\u201d in that phrase seems more like \u201cflourishing\u201d by the day. Iraqi Prime Minister, Nuri al-Maliki, is driving Sunni politicians out of town\u2014literally, in the case of his former vice president, Tariq Hashimi, who fled to Kurdish-controlled Erbil. This crisis was not an anomaly, but merely the most visible manifestation of an escalating trend. Maliki\u2019s subsequent dismissal of the Sunni deputy prime minister, Saleh Mutlaq, was not only a dangerous usurpation of legislative and judicial authority, but also indicates Maliki\u2019s growing fecklessness and aggression.</span></p> <p><span>Like the Kurds before them, the <a href=\"http://islamopediaonline.org/news/feeling-marginalized-some-iraq-sunnis-eye-autonomy\">Sunnis want out</a>. Last <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iraqs-sunni-mps-lift-their-boycott-of-maliki-cabinet-6660303.html\">week\u2019s conclusion</a> of the Sunni boycott on the parliament does not reflect the larger reality. The provincial councils of three Sunni provinces have called for autonomous federal regions similar to the jurisdiction of Iraqi Kurdistan. Maliki will prevent these pseudo-secessions at all costs. He justifiably fears both Sunni autonomy and competition from Moqtada al-Sadr for preeminence among Shi\u2019a. According to Maliki\u2019s political analysis, the gamble of playing the sectarian game is less risky than trying to compromise with Sunnis and Kurds.</span></p> <p><span>The rapidly declining state of affairs was not inevitable. The proximate cause was the swift reduction of American military forces, especially those involved in training new troops. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/world/middleeast/07military.html?pagewanted=all\">The fourteen to eighteen</a> thousand troops recommended by former Commander of American Forces in Iraq, General Lloyd Austin, would have been a physical and symbolic barrier to the rising sectarian violence. Whether that steep reduction in troops ought to be considered the ultimate cause of Iraq\u2019s crisis is arguable. Regardless, we must recognize that the rapid reduction of troops drastically destabilized an already fragile country and greatly reduced American influence and leverage.</span></p> <p><span>The unwillingness of Iraq to sign another <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/sofa.htm\">Status of Forces Agreement</a> this year ostensibly doomed any possibility of American troops remaining on the ground. SOFA is an agreement that stipulates what laws govern the American forces in a foreign country, particularly whether American soldiers are under the jurisprudence of American or local laws. <a href=\"http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=47667\">Pundits</a> can only speculate as to how hard the Obama administration fought not to meet one of its campaign promises. The American rush out the door represents yet another moment in this long war when American leaders saw what they want to see instead of the reality of the situation. Obama\u2019s Fort Bragg speech, in which he referred to Iraq as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/us/politics/obamas-speech-to-troops-at-fort-bragg.html?pagewanted=all\">\u201csovereign</a>, stable and self-reliant,\u201d merits as much notoriety as Bush\u2019s 2003 \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner.</span></p> <p><span>Efforts to exert leverage in other spheres have proven unsuccessful. One <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/opinion/sunday/sales-and-strategy.html?ref=editorialsandopinion\">New York Times editorial</a> suggested that an $11 billion arms deal in December between America and Iraq should have included \u201cfirm guarantees that Mr. Maliki would do a lot more to share power and resources.\u201d Chances are that the deal included at least firm promises. But even if commitments were made on paper, why would they be fulfilled? The message that America has continually sent to the region from the Egyptian Delta to the palaces of Lahore is that deep coffers do not imply deep strength of will. Go ahead, place tens of thousands of protestors in prison without civil trials, cut off our supply routes to Afghanistan, and undermine our allies. America will still provide financial and military aid with a string of ready-made excuses.</span></p> <p><span>The Pentagon argues that foreign military aid bolsters American diplomatic leverage. And it does. Until it becomes a yearly gift instead of a yearly deal. At that point, American officials inevitably say that without aid, X country would commit more human rights abuses, Y country would befriend Iran, China, or whomever, and Z country would further undermine our interests. Often, those excuses are right in the short-term. However, in the long run, this malleability reduces America to a dupe of our enemies and the world\u2019s fool.</span></p> <p><span>Members of Congress and President Obama deserve praise for initially freezing our share of Pakistan\u2019s military aid at 60 percent. The subsequent stipulation that unfroze our share of Pakistani aid is less laudable. Congress only requires assurances from the US defense secretary, Leon Panetta that Pakistan is <a href=\"http://tribune.com.pk/story/314833/obamas-new-years-gift-signs-bill-freezing-aid-to-pakistan/\">\u201cworking to</a> counter improvised explosive devices.\u201d For Pakistan\u2019s military, Pakistan\u2019s stability is a Gordian Knot, so the pretension of countering IEDs ought to be low-hanging fruit in comparison. Likewise, <a href=\"http://www.mylocalaustin.com/news/national/526932/3613B-in-Egyptian-aid-at-risk-in-NGO-row.html\">America\u2019s threat</a> to cut off military aid to Egypt on the basis of travel bans placed on Americans in Egypt is all bark and no bite. America\u2019s relationships with Pakistan and Egypt, as with Iraq, demonstrate that America is an ally you can count on\u2026even when you no longer consider her an ally.</span></p> <p><span>For revealing the weaknesses of American foreign policy, the imminent chaos in Iraq ought to be a major story of the year for 2012.

Scott P. Brown that bans members of Congress from participating in insider trading and requires them to disclose all personal stock transactions.</span></p> <p><span>Brown filed the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act in the Senate on Nov. 15, and it was approved by a wide margin last week. The House version that passed Thursday differed from the bill approved in the Senate, though, removing a provision to regulate the information provided to hedge funds and mutual funds. The two bills must be reconciled before President Barack Obama can sign the bill into law as he has pledged to do.</span></p> <p><span>In recent weeks, the STOCK Act has been hailed by Democrats and Republicans, including Brown, as a matter of good governance and common sense. But Massachusetts political analysts have suggested that Brown\u2019s interest in the bill is based more on his own political strategy in the U.S. Senate race against Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren than the actual substance of the legislation.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis measure has to be seen as part of a giant mosaic of a narrative that Brown is trying to create for himself,\u201d said Michael Goldman, a Democratic political consultant in Massachusetts. \u201cHe is an extremely wealthy individual who most people in the state do not realize is not a citizen legislator.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Republican analysts have said that the legislation was purely a policy issue.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis was exposed, and he reacted,\u201d said Alicia Preston, a former consultant for Brown. \u201cThat\u2019s called being a leader. That\u2019s why he was elected.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Still, political analysts say that Brown has tried, as he did in 2010, to position himself as an independent everyman of sorts to appeal to Massachusetts voters who are typically farther to the left than the mainstream Republican party.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is not going to be a campaign about the issues. This is going to be a campaign about how these two candidates connect with the electorate,\u201d\u00a0 said M. Marty Linsky, a lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School. \u201cIt\u2019s critical for Brown to maintain the kind of independent posture that he\u2019s worked very hard to create.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The STOCK Act comes at a time when the personal finances and investments of Congressmen and candidates across the country have come under a great deal of scrutiny.</span></p> <p><span>In January, Brown\u2019s campaign criticized Warren upon the release of her tax returns, calling her out of touch and hypocritical. Warren\u2019s returns showed that the consumer advocate received over $700,000 in compensation in the previous two years.</span></p> <p><span>Political analysts said Brown is using the legislation as a chance to distance himself from similar arguments that could potentially upset his own populist narrative.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cUntil Elizabeth Warren decided to run against Scott Brown, he had no interest in reforming anything to do with Wall Street, including insider trading,\u201d Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh wrote in an email. \u201cThe STOCK Act is just the latest attempt by Brown to distance himself from Wall Street and the GOP leadership.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Brown\u2019s campaign released a radio advertisement earlier this week publicizing the bill and highlighting what Brown has decried an unfair advantage enjoyed by Congress.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cServing in elective office is a privilege, not an opportunity for personal gain,\u201d Brown said in the ad.</span></p> <p><span>Though Congress has attempted to tackle insider trading within its ranks in the past, Brown\u2019s involvement beginning last November marked the first time a Republican had taken leadership on the initiative.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Nicholas P.

The merry band feted the insurance industry's lobbyist-in-chief with an impromptu gala, honoring Ms. Ignagni with an award for \"Excellence in the Business of Denying People Medical Care.\" The revelers welcomed conference goers with cheers of \"A-HIP-Hooray\" and explained why Ms. Ignagni had been chosen for this ignominious award<b>. </b></span></p> <p><span>The award read: \u201cBe it hereby known that Karen Ignagni has successfully upheld the interests of private insurance in the face of efforts to reduce the costs of administrative waste and to insure all Americans, preserving company rights to profit before the public\u2019s right to health.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Nearby, a comatose patient lay under a sign declaring \"45,000 deaths per year due to lack of insurance\", citing a well-publicized <a href=\"http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2008.157685\">study</a> by Harvard Medical School.</span></p> <p><span>The 12-foot tall puppet was allowed to pay to register for the conference but barred from entering any of the conference buildings; poignantly illustrating that corporate medicine will gladly take the money of those not invited to the table. Unperturbed, the outdoor gala-goers still had plenty to say. \"We want to thank AHIP and the insurance industry for making us all filthy rich,\" said one protester dressed as Max Baucus, the senior US senator from Montana.</span></p> <p><span>More seriously, another protestor noted that, \u201cthe target here is not just the insurance industry, but the wholesale corruption of our government by corporate interests.\u201d He told conference-goers, \"when the health care industry spends half a billion dollars each year lobbying Congress, it's difficult to achieve meaningful health reform that prioritizes the health of the public.\"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/oct/01/lobbyists-millions-obama-healthcare-reform\"></a></span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s fitting that Ignagni was the keynote speaker at a conference titled \u201cThe Future of Healthcare: Innovative Business Models.\u201d The current business model in healthcare legislation goes something like this: Large corporations spend hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbyists and contribute millions more directly to politicians on both sides of the aisle. Politicians then allow private health insurers to profit tremendously from a system that provides neither adequate coverage nor adequate care and has failed utterly to contain costs.</span></p> <p><span>AHIP's success in this model is exemplary. Health insurance and drug companies donated $26.2 million to the 111th Congress. Politicians receiving the largest <a href=\"http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/newsrelease/health-insurers-and-drug-companies-contributed-262-million-111th-congress\">campaign contributions</a> from health insurers were Barack Obama, John McCain, John Kerry, Max Baucus, Eric Cantor and John Boehner. After a vigorous ($86 million) <a href=\"http://www.fa-mag.com/fa-news/9593-insurers-profit-from-health-law-they-spent-millions-to-fight.html\">campaign</a> against health reform, health insurers not only defeated the public option but also got a bill that will compel all Americans to purchase private insurance. <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2009/10/22/65754/ahip-enemy-reform/\">Critics</a> may call AHIP two-faced, but we believe that its goals are clear: promoting the profitability of the health insurance industry.</span></p> <p><span>Since Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) passed into law, health insurers have seen record profits, raising premiums well above inflation. Last year the <a href=\"http://healthcareforamericanow.org/site/content/reports/\">profits</a> from the five largest insurers, UnitedHealth, WellPoint, Aetna, Humana and Cigna totaled $12.6 billion. That\u2019s enough money to <a href=\"http://www.nationalpriorities.org/\">increase</a> the number of low-income children receiving healthcare by 6.45 million. As working families and employers <a href=\"http://www.secinfo.com/\">struggle</a> to pay rising premiums, insurance CEOs rake in salaries of $10-20 million a year, which is 300 to 600 times greater than the median personal income in the U.S.<a href=\"http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/newsrelease/health-insurers-and-drug-companies-contributed-262-million-111th-congress\"></a></span></p> <p><span>Obamacare will expand coverage to many of the <a href=\"http://healthcareforamericanow.org/site/content/reports/\"></a><a href=\"http://www.nationalpriorities.org/\"></a><a href=\"http://www.secinfo.com/\"></a>over 40 million Americans without health insurance. Still, health insurance often fails to provide adequate coverage. <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/p60-239.pdf\"></a>Twenty-five million Americans are <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthfund.org/\">underinsured</a>. In 2007, medical bills contributed to 62% of all personal bankruptcies. And 69% of those experiencing medical bankruptcy actually <a href=\"http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343%2809%2900404-5/abstract\">had health insurance</a> at the time they got sick or injured\u2014just not enough. <a href=\"http://www.pnhp.org/resources/pnhp-research-the-case-for-a-national-health-program\"></a></span></p> <p><span>For health care, the US pays more and gets less on key outcomes, such as health status (life expectancy) and financial risk protection (not being bankrupted by out-of-pocket medical expenses). The U.S. spends $7,500 per person on healthcare each year, <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/\">twice as much</a> as other rich nations spend, including Japan ($2,700), Spain ($2,900), Sweden ($3,500) and France ($3,700). And yet U.S. <a href=\"http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/\">life expectancy</a> is 78.2 years, while Japan\u2019s is 83.0, Spain\u2019s is 81.8, Sweden\u2019s is 81.4 and France\u2019s is 81.0.</span></p> <p><span>Happily, there are plans that could truly reform our health system. One promising fix for our health system is to consolidate to single-payer insurance, a system in which a single public or quasi-public agency organizes health financing, but delivery of care remains largely private. With one payer, the US could save enough on administrative costs (<a href=\"http://www.pnhp.org/resources/pnhp-research-the-case-for-a-national-health-program\">more than $350 billion annually</a>) to cover all of the uninsured. \u00a0Patients would regain free choice of doctor and hospital, and doctors would regain autonomy over patient care.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, there\u2019s nothing that private health insurers and their lobbyists will fight harder against. After all, although a single-payer healthcare system would save American lives, it would hurt the profitability of the health insurance industry. \u00a0The industry will continue to fight so that the champagne will keep flowing, the money will keep showering down, and the accordion will keep playing.</span></p> <p><span><i>Jacob Bor is an\u00a0ScD candidate in Global Health &amp; Population at the Harvard School of Public Health.\u00a0Heather Lanthorn is an\u00a0ScD candidate in Global Health &amp; Population at the Harvard School of Public Health.

They are probably our two greatest loves, so we began to think of how we could combine them into one giant love. And then we got it: Alumni Power Rankings.</span></p> <p><span>We all know how great the past two weeks have been for Jeremy Lin, but what about other alumni? How have they been faring in this New Year? We decided to look at the top seven Alumni to see if anyone could top Lin so far in 2012.</span></p> <p><span><b>No. 7: Matt Damon (formerly '92)</b></span></p> <p><span>Matt Damon cemented his place as a Hollywood action juggernaut with the Jason Bourne series. After winning an Oscar for \u201cBest Original Screenplay\u201d for <i>Good Will Hunting</i>, I don\u2019t think anyone would have expected to end up <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLt7lXDCHQ0\">beating the snot out of people in his later films. </a></span></p> <p><span>But Damon\u00a0<a href=\"http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2011/12/14/matt-damon-blasts-bourne-ultimatum-writer-tony-gilroy/\">is no longer the star of the continuing Bourne Series</a>, and he recently made a movie about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdX47LtXpw\">buying a zoo</a>. Poor form, Matt. That's called \"setting swag to zero.\" No Hahvahd tours are going to keep stopping outside Matthews to point at your freshman room if you\u2019re a zookeeper.</span></p> <p><span><b>No. 6: Ryan Fitzpatrick \u201905</b></span></p> <p><span>A few months ago, \u201cFitzmagic\u201d probably would\u2019ve come in close to the top of this list. After leading a typically hapless Buffalo Bills team to a 4-2 record, including a win over the eventual Super Bowl runner-ups, the New England Patriots, the Bills rewarded the former Crimson standout with <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/blog/the-back-page/article/2011/11/1/alumni-tracker-fitzmagic/\">a six-year, $59 million contract extension.</a></span></p> <p><span>But Fitzpatrick and his Bills stumbled halfway through the season, as the team lost eight of the last 10 games, and Buffalo failed to make the playoffs for the 12th straight season. However, win or lose, Fitzpatrick still has one of the more <a href=\"http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/slides/photos/001/612/406/131629721_display_image.jpg?1322451286\">baller beards</a> in all of professional sports, so he\u2019s got that going for him, which is nice.</span></p> <p><span><b> </b></span></p> <p><span><b>No. 5 Natalie Portman \u201903</b></span></p> <p><span>I promise, Natalie, I won\u2019t hold <i>The Attacks of the Clones</i> against you, because if you couldn\u2019t make Hayden Christiansen look like <a href=\"http://www.totalfilm.com/features/27-actors-who-can-t-act/hayden-christensen\">a half-way decent actor</a>, who could? And after two box offices smashes in <i>Black Swan</i> (for which she won the Oscar for \u201cBest Actress\u201d) and <i>No Strings Attached</i>, she welcomed her first son, Aleph, last summer. Plus, considering she made out with <a href=\"http://a.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/gty_mila_kunis_natalie_portman_nt_110329_wg.jpg\">Mila Kunis</a>, she can die happy.</span></p> <p><span>With so much professional and personal success, you might be wondering why is Portman so low? Because she won\u2019t return my calls. Come on, Natalie! What\u2019s a guy got to do? You had a kid with a ballet dancer? Sportswriters are definitely probably manlier than ballerinos. As I said in my emails: we could go to Caf\u00e9 of India (your favorite restaurant in Cambridge) and then maybe pop next door for some Burdick\u2019s hot chocolate? And I promise I won\u2019t make fun of the name Aleph more than once.</span></p> <p><span><b>No. 4:</b> <b>Matt Birk \u201998</b></span></p> <p><span>Matt Birk plays one of the most underrated positions in football, and although many current students haven\u2019t heard of him, he is by far Harvard's most successful professional athlete playing today. A 13-year pro, Birk has played center for the Minnesota Vikings and the Baltimore Ravens, earning six Pro-Bowl appearances and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Block_Courage_Award\">Ed Block Courage Award</a> in 2006.</span></p> <p><span>Most recently, after his Ravens were dumped out of the playoffs in the AFC Championship game against the Patriots, Birk went on to receive the <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-videos/09000d5d826ed145/2011-Walter-Payton-NFL-Man-of-the-Year-Matt-Birk\">Walter Payton Man of the Year Award</a>, meant to honor the player whose work both on and off the field inspire others to improve themselves and their community.

Before comingto Harvard, she worked in Iran as a journalist for The New York Times and other publications, until she wasforced to flee during the 2009 protests after threats from the Iranian government.</span></p> <p><span><b>1. Fifteen Minutes: </b>Did you always know you would become a journalist?</span></p> <p><span><b>Nazila Fathi: </b>The first time I fell in love with journalism was when I saw that press conference [in Iran during which Geraldine Brooks was chided by government officials for dressing extremely conservatively]. I realized the power that journalists can indirectly have\u2014the authority, and how politicians could worry about their image in their encounters with reporters.</span></p> <p><span><b>2. FM: </b>How did you get involved with reporting on Iran for The New York Times?</span></p> <p><span><b>NF:</b> I started as a translator.... [News publications] had a huge appetite for stories from Iran. [As a stringer] basically I was on call all the time. They used me whenever they needed me. I didn\u2019t get any credit, partially because I didn\u2019t have credentials, and The New York Times had this policy until early 2000 that they wouldn\u2019t give credit to stringers.</span></p> <p><span><b>3. FM:</b> What were some of the challenges that you faced as a reporter? How did you work around them?</span></p> <p><span><b>NF:</b> Part of [my work] was very secretive for one or two years at the beginning, but then things started to change because the government started valuing us because they knew who we were. I was summoned to the Intelligence Ministry and questioned, grilled.... We were showing a more human image of Iran to people. Until then, reporters were coming to Iran, and they were taking pictures of murals of martyrs on the walls, anti-American and anti-Western slogans on the walls, but then through us they started talking to people who expressed very pro-American feelings, and so the stories became much more different.</span></p> <p><span><b>4. FM:</b> At your talk you spoke mostly about your experience during the 2009 elections. What was one of the more memorable stories you covered before that?</span></p> <p><span><b>NF: </b>The first massive celebration demonstration was over the victory of Iran\u2019s football team [which qualified them] for the 1998 World Cup. That was the first time that people saw that, \u201cOh my God, we can come out in huge numbers,\u201d and the government was terrified. I mean, even traffic police, they were dancing on the roofs of their cars, throwing their hats in the air. It was just a spontaneous, massive celebration. It was then that people realized that they could appear in public in massive numbers, and the first political demonstrations started in 1999.</span></p> <p><span><b>5. FM: </b>What was it like for you to cover the 2009 election as an Iranian?</span></p> <p><span><b>NF: </b>I still believe it was the most important event in our recent history, other than the 1979 Revolution. I don\u2019t think anything has shaken the foundation of the Islamic regime as much as those protests. I grew up in Iran, and for 30 years I wanted to see real change in my country. We\u2019re not talking only about political freedom; we\u2019re talking about very basic rights being taken away from people, especially women...as a woman, as someone who has lived in a repressive society, I was dying to see real change. And I was absolutely excited and happy to see those uprisings; I couldn\u2019t believe the government wouldn\u2019t back down. And deep in my heart, I was waiting. I was waiting for the government to back down, even just to hold new elections. That\u2019s all people wanted. But they didn\u2019t, and the violent crackdown started a week after, so it was a combination of joy and excitement first, then a sense of disappointment and betrayal.</span></p> <p><span><b>6. FM: </b>What was it like to leave Iran?</span></p> <p><span><b>NF: </b>I didn\u2019t know I wouldn\u2019t be able to go back when I was leaving.... I felt like I was betraying my people, that I shouldn\u2019t be leaving. Towards the last three days when my house came under surveillance, I realized that I couldn\u2019t do anything. I didn\u2019t have internet; my phone was tapped; I couldn\u2019t leave my house.... I thought I would leave and things would be completely normal again after a few weeks\u2019 time, and I would come back. I thought the hundreds of people who were arrested would be released after a couple of weeks.... I was writing stories, and we still thought we would go back. It honestly took me about six months to realize we wouldn\u2019t be able to go back.</span></p> <p><span><b>7. FM:</b> What were you doing during those six months?</span></p> <p><span><b>NF:</b> I went to Canada. We had lived in Canada previously, and it was like a second home for us. I wasn\u2019t thinking of putting my kids in school until a week before September, then I suddenly realized that they had to go to school. People were being gradually released\u2014friends, people I knew\u2014and they kept contacting me and warning me not to go back, [telling me about] the fabricated stories that the government had made up, that I was part of the ring that wanted to overthrow the regime, that I was behind the protests. I realized it didn\u2019t make sense to go back.</span></p> <p><span><b>8. FM: </b>In Aug. 2010 you came here for the Nieman Fellowship, and now you\u2019re a Shorenstein Fellow. What sort of work have you been doing?</span></p> <p><span><b>NF: </b>The Nieman Fellowship is basically for mid-career journalists.... They give you one year time off from work to take courses here and to expand your intellectual horizon, and usually by the end of the program we all feel we want to do something different. Or, if people go back to their jobs, they have totally new perspectives. I was inspired to write a book, a memoir to tell a bigger story.... The purpose was to use my own experience as a woman who grew up during the first decade of the revolution and then started working as a reporter during the second and third decades to tell a bigger story of what has happened to Iran, to society, and where it\u2019s moving.</span></p> <p><span><b>9. FM:</b> How has the political situation in Iran changed since Feb. 12, 2010, when the protests died down?</span></p> <p><span><b>NF:</b> The protest continued until February, but before the Feb. 12 protest there was already an internal debate going on among activists and the people who were involved that this was not making sense anymore.... What were they going to achieve? They didn\u2019t want to overthrow the regime because they didn\u2019t have an alternative, the movement didn\u2019t have a clear leadership. The violence was getting out of hand, the number of deaths was escalating, and there was an internal debate\u2014what are we doing out on the streets? I think the movement is very much alive because they still have this internal debate going on.... [The regime knows] that it\u2019s there; it\u2019s simmering beneath the surface. I can\u2019t tell where it\u2019s going, but I\u2019m positive there is a civil society. They\u2019re debating. So this movement is not dead.</span></p> <p><span><b>10.

How do you see that relationship evolving depending on whether or not Obama is re-elected?</span></p> <p><span><b>NF: </b>Iran has been one of the most important foreign policy issues, and they\u2019ve said the military option would be on the table if Iran does not back down from its nuclear program. A military option is just catastrophic; it\u2019s mad. And so far I\u2019ve liked Obama\u2019s foreign policy. I think he\u2019s done well in Pakistan and on Iran. He hasn\u2019t had a very active diplomacy; he wasn\u2019t able to bring Iranians to the negotiating table, which is a major setback, but he is trying.... But I think that 2009 also undermined any kind of efforts for rapprochement or even talks about the nuclear program because Obama was faced with a regime that has no legitimacy at home, so how can he engage in any kind of conversation or dialogue?</span></p> <p><span><b>11.

I have a friend who works at The Financial Times, who I think is doing the best work, but they\u2019re under huge pressure. They receive threats that they can\u2019t go out on certain days....

This was [Ayatollah Ruhollah] Khomeini\u2019s sound bite in the beginning of the Revolution, and it\u2019s everywhere, on the walls, at the military parades.... The Iranian news agency translated it the same way, before I translated it. Maybe it\u2019s the wrong translation, but this is how it\u2019s officially been going around by the regime itself.

{"title": "Not Just Religious Freedom | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>At this university, most debates about reproductive morality center on abortion, so the furor last week regarding whether Catholic universities and hospitals needed to cover contraception in employee heath care plans may seem a more foreign concern.\u00a0 However, the debate illustrates an important clash between liberal and religious ethics over the scope of the state\u2019s power.</span></p> <p><span>Briefly, the Obama administration at first refused Catholic universities and hospitals an exemption from the policy that requires health care providers to include access to reproductive planning services including contraception, sterilization, and the emergency contraceptive Plan B. As the president of the University of Notre Dame, John I. Jenkins, pointed out this September, the Catholic Church opposes contraception, and thus the policy compels Catholic organizations \u201cto either pay for contraception and sterilization in violation of the Church\u2019s moral teaching, or to discontinue our employee and student health care plans.\u201d Jenkins asked that exemptions be provided beyond those organizations \u201cthat primarily serve persons who share its religious tenets\u201d to include ones like Notre Dame, which \u201cshares common religious bonds and convictions with a church.\u201d In doing so, Jenkins suggested that such an exception would \u201cprotect the conscience\u201d of those who work for universities like Notre Dame and believe contraception use is wrong. Yet this discussion of conscience versus government regulation ignored the reason that the government issued the contraception mandate in the first place\u2014the rights of the women whose contraception is on the line.</span></p> <p><span>These women have rights and liberties that the government must defend. Those affected by Notre Dame\u2019s health care policy range from professors to students to dining hall workers, and although many of them are Catholic like the university that educates and employs them, many are not. Furthermore, despite the Catholic Church\u2019s ban on contraception, 98 percent of American Catholic women use some form of contraception\u2014about the same rate as other women. Many women who work for Notre Dame thus use or will wish to use birth control, which is often prohibitively expensive. As one Harvard student told me recently, \u201cMy father is a deacon of an evangelical Christian church, and I knew that if anything ever showed up on insurance for contraception, I would be disowned. I decided to go to Planned Parenthood and was absolutely surprised when the nurse told me that my bill for a fifteen-minute appointment and thirty pills was $130. With $145 to my name, I had to choose two of the three: have sex, not get pregnant, or have more than $15 to your name. I chose not getting pregnant.\u201d Birth control can at times be so expensive that allowing anti-contraceptive modification of a health plan would prevent some women from receiving birth control.</span></p> <p><span>The women who work for Notre Dame have the right to the full health care plan afforded to women elsewhere in the United States\u2014to equal access to the same benefits regardless of the views of their employer. This right necessarily begins beyond those organizations \u201cthat primarily serve persons who share its religious tenets\u201d because only organizations with such specific membership criteria can presume that their members will agree to renounce contraceptives. The difference between organizations that primarily serve those with the same religious beliefs and those that are simply affiliated with a church is that it can be reasonably inferred that members of the former kind (for example, nuns or missionaries, as the language of the government decision suggests) personally reject contraceptives. Institutions that are simply affiliated with a church cannot ensure the same. Nuns may reasonably be expected to not need contraception because of the conditions under which they join their sisterhood, but college students and janitorial staff are not implicitly held to reproductive choices because of their membership in a religious university, nor should they be.</span></p> <p><span>The Obama administration\u2019s efforts to ensure women\u2019s access to contraceptives originally forced some health care holders to pay for contraceptives they deemed immoral. Obama\u2019s eventual concession, which gives women access to contraception at the insurance companies\u2019 cost rather than the cost of the insurance pool, protects the freedom of conscience of Americans who believe that contraception is wrong by exempting religious organizations from paying for contraceptives. The recent concession does as much as possible to protect individuals from financing what they consider immoral while defending the right of all women to the same health insurance regardless of their employer\u2019s religious views. Ultimately, the contraception mandate is not so much government interference with religious values as it is a legitimate protection of workers and students who would otherwise face discrimination based on the views of others members of their insurance pool. Individuals should at times have a \u201cconscience clause\u201d that exempts them from participation in government programs, but not at the price of denying access to others who have not committed to the same religious conscience.</span></p> <p><span><i>Sarah C.

Despite how well most liberal secularists remember the outsize role of religion in policy from 2001 to 2009, they proudly elected a president in 2008 who promised to maintain it, allowing some minor adjustments. Inspired by his predecessor\u2019s example, Obama kept open the White House\u2019s office for faith-based <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/religion/articles/2009/08/31/a-new-role-for-faith-in-obamas-white-house\">initiatives</a>, \u201cgiv[ing] religious figures a bigger role in influencing White House decisions\u201d and consecrating a new level of intimacy between church and the highest levels of state. Presaging a national political career that would justify social policy ideas with themes from the New Testament, Obama proclaimed in his 2004 keynote <a href=\"http://obamaspeeches.com/002-Keynote-Address-at-the-2004-Democratic-National-Convention-Obama-Speech.htm\">address</a> to the Democratic National Convention, \u201cWe worship an awesome God in the blue states.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Except, of course, when we do not. In courting America\u2019s religious majority, the Obama administration has demonstrated little support for secular Americans. Despite their disproportionate representation in the arts, sciences, and all manner of scholarship, it is nearly impossible for an openly nonreligious person to run successfully for public office. As recently as June 2011, 49 percent of adults polled by <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/148100/hesitant-support-mormon-2012.aspx\">Gallup</a> avowed that they would not under any circumstances support an atheist for president. And while liberal readers might be sure that this is strictly a problem of the right, may it be noted that of all 244 Democratic members of Congress, only one\u2014Pete Stark (CA-13)\u2014is openly atheist.</span></p> <p><span>Some supporters of President Obama argue that a religiously inspired presidency should be acceptable to secular Americans, provided that it inclines more toward the humanistic New Testament than the stringent Old Testament. All reasonable people believe in universal healthcare and humanitarian military intervention, right? So what if it means the President is not sure about how marriage equality sits with his religious conscience?</span></p> <p><span>As a secular American, I beg to differ. Not all of us are liberal Democrats; there are plenty of libertarians, quirky independents, and open-minded conservatives among our diverse and growing ranks. And although I certainly find him more palatable than most of his Republican rivals, I do not any more appreciate having to accept Obama\u2019s liberal policies on the basis of a worldview beyond rational substantiation. Unlike today\u2019s religious conservatives, I know that I am not being persecuted\u2014but I feel deeply concerned when President Obama invokes faith to unite Episcopalians on the left and Baptists on the right, to the exclusion of me and millions of other secular Americans.</span></p> <p><span>If a place where presidential policy and rhetoric are inspired by the teachings of an \u201cawesome God\u201d can be called a secular tyranny, then we should be doubly afraid of the theocratic alternative proposed by the right-wing primary crowd. In what is hailed as the party of small government, nothing is more in vogue than legislating Leviticus and Deuteronomy\u2014biblical books whose dictates bear a striking similarity to the Islamic shari\u2019a law that their proponents decry.</span></p> <p><span>Big-ticket Republicans face excommunication if they fail to toe the line on abortion, same-sex marriage, or sham issues like school prayer\u2014a standard that has vanquished such potential standard-bearers as Rudy Giuliani and Jon Huntsman. In terms of foreign policy, the current election cycle has seen messianically inspired Republican candidates beat the drums of war against Iran in a misguided effort to sway Jewish votes on the basis of a single issue. If I have read the founding fathers properly, this is not what they had in mind.</span></p> <p><span>In short, the idea of an Obama administration-led \u201csecular tyranny\u201d fails to hold water, especially when held up to the very real prospect of a Republican regime of effective religious establishment. But truthfully, neither option is ideal. For all of its advantages, the liberal theology professed by Obama and his ilk continues to privilege religious voices in political discourse over those of an unrepresented secular minority. When secular blue-state voters like me are nudged by a community-organizing Chicago liberal to remember that we worship an awesome God, we puzzle over how anyone could think of the Obama administration as a secular tyranny.</span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span><i>Joshua B.

Jeremy Lin.</span></p> <p><span>There. It\u2019s out of my system. Unlike every other media outlet in the country, that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about that. Because this column is supposed to be about the Harvard men\u2019s basketball team, and there\u2019s a lot to discuss on that topic as well.</span></p> <p><span>Over my 20 years of life, there have been three constants: death, taxes, and the Crimson losing in Jadwin Gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span>Actually, I haven\u2019t died, nor have I started paying taxes yet, so those aren\u2019t actually true. But the third one is, as Harvard hasn\u2019t won at Princeton since 1989, and has never swept the Penn-Princeton road trip in its history.</span></p> <p><span>Those demons held strong once again this past weekend, when the Crimson survived a rowdy Palestra with a 56-50 win, then succumbed, 70-62, to its buzzer-beating, heart-breaking, no-real-grad-school-containing, Carlton Banks-accepting, Woodrow-Wilsoning, club-eating New Jersey rivals. Again.</span></p> <p><span>The loss knocked Harvard out of both Top 25 polls, likely for good this regular season, while leaving the door open for Penn and Yale to make a late-season run at the Ivy title.</span></p> <p><span>Though the defeat will hurt its potential NCAA seed, Harvard is still in good shape for the league championship. With a one-game lead and four of its last six at home (where it hasn\u2019t lost in its last 25 games)\u2014and the other two contests at beatable Cornell and Columbia\u2014the Crimson is still the favorite to win its first outright Ivy title ever. But for a team with larger aspirations\u2014a squad that is talented enough to win games in the NCAA tournament\u2014there is still a lot that needs to be improved.</span></p> <p><span>Most importantly, while the defense has been great all season long, the offense has been incredibly inconsistent. Though Tommy Amaker loves to emphasize \"our bench and our balance,\" such an alliteration has resulted in a team that has averaged just 63 points per game since New Year\u2019s Day. That\u2019s good enough to win Ivy contests or beat another defense-oriented team like Florida State, but not to top more offensively-talented opponents in the Big Dance.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard desperately needs a go-to crunch-time scorer for close games down the stretch, like the one at Princeton last Saturday. The team tried to turn to Kyle Casey, but the junior missed a makeable layup and four back-breaking free-throws late in the contest.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, Keith Wright\u2019s mid-range game has been largely nonexistent all year, hurting the Crimson\u2019s ability to run the pick-and-roll and leaving Wright stuck in double-teams down low. Outside, Laurent Rivard shot a combined 0-for-8 from three last weekend, and the team simply can\u2019t win if it\u2019s not knocking down the long ball.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019ve watched every single one of Harvard\u2019s 24 games this season, and, quite frankly, if you asked me to name the best player on the team, I would have no idea who to say. For while they\u2019ve all been good, nobody\u2019s been great, as Wright was last season when he won Player of the Year.</span></p> <p><span>Freshman Corbin Miller was the team\u2019s best scorer last weekend, making up for Rivard\u2019s woes from three-point range. Shooting 47 percent on the year from outside the arc, Miller continues to serve as the offensive spark Harvard often badly needs, and he should certainly be seeing more minutes in the future.</span></p> <p><span>Expecting a freshman to emerge as a go-to guy is a lot to ask, but right now nobody else on the Crimson has shown the ability to generate points on a consistent basis. Someone needs to step up and emerge as a closer.</span></p> <p><span>But enough about Harvard\u2014on to the rest of the league.</span></p> <p><span>BROWN (7-18, 1-7 Ivy) AT HARVARD (21-3, 7-1)</span></p> <p><span>There was an Eric Carle book I used to read as a child entitled \"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?\"</span></p> <p><span>Let\u2019s try it:</span></p> <p><span>\"Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I see a terrible basketball team looking at me.\"</span></p> <p><span>Yes, the Bears continue to underachieve and have lost five straight Ivy games by at least nine, including a 26-point shellacking at Columbia last Friday. This will be a nice way for the Crimson to bounce back from its Princeton loss.</span></p> <p><span>Pick: Harvard 76, Brown 61</span></p> <p><span>COLUMBIA (14-10, 3-5) AT PRINCETON (13-10, 4-3)</span></p> <p><span>The Lions continue to impress. After hanging with Harvard for 40 minutes at Lavietes two weeks ago, they came home and dismantled Brown before losing by just a point to Yale.</span></p> <p><span>He won\u2019t win it, but Brian Barbour deserves serious consideration for Ivy Player of the Year for carrying Columbia by himself after Noruwa Agho went down earlier in the season.</span></p> <p><span>But Princeton, as we know, is tough at home, and I\u2019d expect it to pull out another close one.</span></p> <p><span>Pick: Princeton 65, Columbia 59</span></p> <p><span>YALE (16-6, 6-2) AT DARTMOUTH (4-20, 0-8)</span></p> <p><span>Yale is 6-2 in league play, but it\u2019s been extremely lucky to get there. Its 30-point home loss to Harvard was easily the worst of any team this conference season. Then, after barely squeaking by the Killer P\u2019s at home, the Bulldogs had a rough road trip last weekend, being upset by a point in overtime at Cornell before barely surviving at Columbia.</span></p> <p><span>Though Greg Mangano continues to dominate inside, things just haven\u2019t fully clicked for the Bulldogs.</span></p> <p><span>Luckily for them, they get to play Dartmouth.</span></p> <p><span>Pick: Yale 69, Dartmouth 63</span></p> <p><span>CORNELL (10-12, 5-3) AT PENN (13-11, 5-2)</span></p> <p><span>Zack Rosen versus Chris Wroblewski.</span></p> <p><span>The battle of the senior, redheaded, Jewish ballers. It\u2019s going down like a dreidel after too many spins, an overly-dense matzo ball, or some Manischewitz after a long, hard day.</span></p> <p><span>Because after Lin (okay, I mentioned him again) proved this month that Ivy-educated Asian-Americans can indeed play, it\u2019s up to these two to do the same for the Ancient Eight\u2019s Jews. The nation will be watching. Don\u2019t let us down, gentlemen. You\u2019re our best hope.</span></p> <p><span>Pick: Penn 75, Cornell 67</span></p> <p><span>YALE AT HARVARD</span></p> <p><span>I would expect the Bulldogs to play better than they did the last time these two squads met, when Yale scored less as a team than Lin (yes, I know) did against the Lakers. Then again, I recently watched \"Due Date,\" and considering the bulldog in that movie was hanging out with Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifinakis, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that they can be entirely unpredictable.</span></p> <p><span>The Mangano-Wright matchup will be one to watch again. Mangano, though, will hopefully be a little bit nicer to Wright than he usually is, considering that\u2014as the current Ivy Leaguer with the most NBA potential\u2014he will probably be a big beneficiary of Lin\u2019s (whoops) recent success.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019d expect Yale\u2014playing for pride after its prior embarrassment, and for its season\u2014to actually show up for this one. But the Crimson doesn\u2019t lose at home.</span></p> <p><span>Pick: Harvard 68, Yale 62</span></p> <p><span>BROWN AT DARTMOUTH</span></p> <p><span>This is it Dartmouth. It\u2019s your best chance. It\u2019s now or never.</span></p> <p><span>You\u2019ve won one Ivy game in each of the last two seasons, and you\u2019re going to do it again.</span></p> <p><span>You don\u2019t think you can? Of course you can! It\u2019s Brown! You can beat Brown!</span></p> <p><span>Yes, Dartmouth, I know Brown\u2019s not a Division III team. But it plays like one! You can pretend!</span></p> <p><span>This is your time. Every inspiring song and speech ever written was written for your moment, right now. This is \"Eye of the Tiger,\" Al Pacino\u2019s speech in \"Any Given Sunday,\" and the 2008 Obama campaign all wrapped into one.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s right there in front of you, Dartmouth. Go out and seize the moment.</span></p> <p><span>I believe in you, even though nobody else will.</span></p> <p><span>Pick: Dartmouth 65, Brown 62</span></p> <p><span>CORNELL AT PRINCETON</span></p> <p><span>There have been a lot of great players to come out of these two programs recently, and many of them have found success playing ball elsewhere. Because while not all Ivy Leaguers are lucky enough to be the talk of the country and the biggest story of the NBA season (you don\u2019t know that\u2019s who I\u2019m referring to!) it is certainly possible to continue one\u2019s playing career around the world.</span></p> <p><span>For example, Kareem Maddox is playing in Holland. Dan Mavraides is playing in Greece. Louis Dale is playing in Germany. Jeff Foote is playing in the NBADL. Ryan Wittman is playing in Poland.</span></p> <p><span>What\u2019s that? Wittman\u2019s still at Morgan Stanley? Well, never mind then.</span></p> <p><span>Pick: Princeton 65, Cornell 61</span></p> <p><span>COLUMBIA AT PENN</span></p> <p><span>I visited the Palestra for the first time last weekend, and it truly is all it\u2019s made out to be. For one, it actually feels like a college basketball arena, rather than a high school gym (*cough* Lavietes *cough*). Second, you can just feel the history emanating from that place. And third, it\u2019s built to allow noise to travel incredibly well. At times last Friday, even though there were only 7,500 people there, it sounded like there were 75,000. Just an awesome experience.</span></p> <p><span>Also, it was fun to watch Rosen try to score in every way humanly possible, throwing up shot after shot after shot. Unfortunately for him, he finished just 6-for-21.</span></p> <p><span>To be fair, not everyone can come up big in the most important game of his life. We can\u2019t all be Jeremy Lin.</span></p> <p><span>There. I\u2019m done. 1,500 words and only 4.5 additional mentions of Linsanity. That\u2019s way under the national average of 1,478 per 1,500. I\u2019m very proud of myself.</span></p> <p><span>Pick: Penn 70, Columbia 64</span></p> <p><span>LAST WEEK: 6-2</span></p> <p><span>SEASON: 19-3</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Scott A.

{"title": "We\u2019re All Statists Now | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Rick Santorum might defeat Mitt Romney in the Michigan primary next Tuesday. It\u2019s worth dwelling for a second on how insane this is. Mitt Romney spent his entire pre-college life in Michigan. He was born in Detroit and grew up in Bloomfield Hills. His father was first the Chief Executive Officer of American Motors, and as such a major public figure in the state, and then governor for six years. His brother is active in state Republican politics, having run for Attorney General in 1998. And Romney won the state by <a href=\"http://politics.nytimes.com/election-guide/2008/results/states/MI.html\">nine points</a> in 2008, despite John McCain having bested him in New Hampshire the previous week. Michigan, along with Massachusetts and Utah (where he can count on heavy Mormon turnout), is one of the states that it just makes no sense for Romney to lose.</span></p> <p><span>But as of this writing, the polls show Santorum <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/mi/michigan_republican_presidential_primary-1589.html\">beating</a> Romney by an average of five points. The New York Times\u2019 Five Thirty Eight blog <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/fivethirtyeight/primaries/michigan\">gives</a> Santorum a 57 percent chance of victory. I\u2019m still in the camp that thinks a Santorum nomination is basically impossible. To nominate a candidate whose last election ended in a 20-point landslide loss as an incumbent would be an unprecedented act of electoral suicide. Political scientists <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Party-Decides-Presidential-Nominations-American/dp/0226112373\">tell us</a> that primaries are decided, ultimately, by party elites, and I think the elites in question fear a Santorum win enough to stop it from happening. But I also agree with the anonymous GOP senator who\u2019s been <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/02/top-gop-senator-says-if-romney-loses-michigan-we-need-a-new-candidate/\">telling reporters</a> that if Romney loses Michigan, another candidate needs to enter the race and force a brokered convention. If Romney loses what\u2019s essentially his home state, he can\u2019t be taken seriously as a nominee.</span></p> <p><span>That, too, would be a disaster without much precedent, and it\u2019s worth asking how the GOP got itself caught in this bind. Focusing on any one factor would be a mistake. It\u2019s true that Romney just isn\u2019t a very exciting candidate, that Santorum is more charismatic, and that for socially conservative primary voters, the notoriously anti-gay and anti-birth control Santorum is more appealing than the man who once told an LGBT newspaper that he\u2019d be <a href=\"http://cnsnews.com/image/romney-7\">better than Ted Kennedy</a> on gay and lesbian issues. But in Michigan specifically, Santorum\u2019s relative success may owe to something stranger: he\u2019s running to Romney\u2019s left on economic issues.</span></p> <p><span>While both Romney and Santorum opposed the auto industry bailout that saved Detroit\u2019s manufacturing sector, Santorum has taken issue with the fact that Romney supported the bank bailouts that happened around the same time. \u201cGovernor Romney supported the bailout of Wall Street and decided not to support the bailout of Detroit,\u201d Santorum <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/17/us/politics/in-detroit-santorum-defends-opposition-to-auto-bailout.html\">said</a>. \u201cMy feeling was that we should not support\u2014the government should not be involved in bailouts, period.\u201d The implication is clear: Romney will bail out big finance, but not auto workers. Santorum may not help anybody, but at least he doesn\u2019t treat the little guy worse.</span></p> <p><span>Even more jarringly, Santorum has <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204059804577227700916784184.html\">spoken enthusiastically</a> about unions, saying, \u201cI have no problem with private sector unions\u201d and recalling his grandfather\u2019s membership in a coal miner\u2019s union. In a way, this isn\u2019t too surprising. Santorum, after all, spent two terms as a Senator from Pennsylvania, a state where unions have a substantial presence and where catering to industrial interests is the only way to get elected. He <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/100805/santorum-blue-collar-appeal-voters\">voted against</a> a national right-to-work law (which would ban union-only workplaces) and pushed repeatedly for tariffs and other union-backed protectionist measures to help the U.S. steel industry.</span></p> <p><span>And, more generally, Santorum represents a kind of Republican who should be anathema to libertarian-leaning Tea Party types. He <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/romney-backer-jim-talent-who-voted-for-medicare-part-d-slams-santorum-for-supporting-medicare-part-d/2012/02/14/gIQA5DdwDR_blog.html\">backed</a> all manner of major government programs in the Bush years, including the Medicare prescription drug benefit and No Child Left Behind. He was skeptical of free trade, <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1993/roll575.xml\">voting against</a> The North American Free Trade Agreement while a member of the House.\u00a0 He said he was <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/12/30/395884/santorum-defends-earmarks-including-his-vote-for-the-bridge-to-nowhere/\">\u201cproud\u201d</a> of his record of securing earmarks. When faced with a choice between endorsing fellow Senator Arlen Specter\u2014who would five years later become a Democrat and support the stimulus and health care reform\u2014and economically conservative Representative Patrick J. Toomey, Sr. in a Senate primary, he backed Specter.</span></p> <p><span>Santorum was, in other words, everything wrong with Bush-era Republicanism, according to the prevailing narrative among Tea Partiers. Against a guy like Romney, who seems positively giddy when attacking unions or defending the rights of corporations, that should be a death sentence. In fact, not only has it not killed Santorum so far, but it may also even be helping him in economically depressed and union-friendly Michigan. And if even Republican primary voters are responding well to a guy with that message, it could mean that the past two years\u2019 sharp right turn in economic policymaking is more of a blip than a realignment.</span></p> <p><span><i>Dylan R.

Thurston \u201999, author of How To Be Black, and a former news and photography editor of The Crimson. He is the digital director of The Onion and co-founder of \u201cJack and Jill Politics\u201d. The following interview took place in the Middlesex Lounge in Cambridge, one stop of many on his national book tour.</span></p> <p><span><b>1. Fifteen Minutes:</b> What house were you in? What was your concentration?</span></p> <p><span><b>Baratunde R. Thurston:</b> I lived in Lowell House, though I never lived in Lowell proper; I lived in Claverly Hall the entire time. It just was like an apartment, it was a little cooler, it had the janky elevator. I love Clav. I was a philosophy concentrator.</span></p> <p><span><b>2.\u00a0FM: </b>What activities did you participate in as an undergraduate at Harvard?</span></p> <p><span><b>BT:</b> In terms of major activities I did, [The] Crimson was very high on the list, [also] Harvard Computer Society. I was a big nerd, and a geek. I was a very active member of [the] Black Students Association, and the Black Men\u2019s Forum...and the Signet\u2014that was later in my career.</span></p> <p><span><b>3.\u00a0FM:</b> Your recent book is part satire, part autobiography, part self-help. How much of each would you describe this book as?</span></p> <p><span><b>BT:</b> Anything you thought was hilarious was actually very true and painful, anything you thought was true and painful I just made it up for dramatic effect. No\u2014it\u2019s anchored in an autobiographical memoir and even those pieces are funny, but they\u2019re true, that\u2019s all very true. And then the how-to satire was meant to basically accentuate the story, and bring out a little more color, no pun intended. And just to mess with people. I really like messing with people. And I wanted to go over the top. It\u2019s an absurd concept, that there\u2019s a way to be black. There is none, and so I embraced that absurdity, and used the satire to get away with it.</span></p> <p><span><b>4.\u00a0FM:</b> Why did you write the book?</span></p> <p><span><b>BT:</b> Because publishing is very lucrative! You can just become a billionaire by putting words on dead trees and hoping people buy them\u2026. And I think because we\u2019re in a good time, like we\u2019re in this sort of post-civil rights moment. We have a bi-racial slash black president in America, and we have this moment of identity where things are more interesting and flexible and people can kind of be more of who they are and be the multiple aspects of who they are, and present that, and have the world accept that in a way that wasn\u2019t quite the case in the past.</span></p> <p><span><b>5.\u00a0FM:</b> You wrote that you rejected the tentative title, \u201cThoughts On Post-Racial America.\u201d What would a post-racial America look like?</span></p> <p><span><b>BT:</b> To borrow some of the thoughts from the people I interviewed, it would be an America full of unicorns and leprechauns, and other non-existent creatures. I don\u2019t think a post-racial America is worth pursuing, because it kind of doesn\u2019t have meaning. I think the way people think about it is very idealized, but not helpful, which is, \u2018Oh, we just ignore race,\u2019 but ignoring its existence doesn\u2019t help us deal with some of the outcomes that are still heavily correlated to or dependent on it. So I think a better America, rather than seeking for a post-racial America\u2014we should be seeking that more perfect union and I think we can do that.</span></p> <p><span><b>6.\u00a0FM:</b> Are white people and black people supposed to have different experiences reading the book?</span></p> <p><span><b>BT:</b> Yeah, so when white people read the book, it\u2019s supposed to burn their fingertips a little bit. And their soul actually flees into the body of a black person. It\u2019s kind of a race-swap program.</span></p> <p><span><b>7. FM:</b> How does one get a job writing for The Onion?</span></p> <p><span><b>BT:</b> One does not get a job at The Onion. One murders a current Onion employee and assumes their identity. So I am actually technically Mike DiCenzo, who left The Onion a few years ago to write for Jimmy Fallon, and I\u2019ve been filling in for him ever since. So skin\u2019s a little tight, but it works out well.</span></p> <p><span><b>8. FM: </b>Is satire the highest form of comedy?</span></p> <p><span><b>BT:</b> Satire is like the highest form of living. It\u2019s just the best way to be. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the highest form of comedy. It is a very important art. And it has the ability to communicate truth and insight in a way that really messes with people, that kind of challenges the line between joke and statement but leans toward joke most of the time. And can, when done very well, attract people and reach people who wouldn\u2019t be open to being reached by that message.</span></p> <p><span><b>9. FM:</b> Is \u201cfunny\u201d about exposing what\u2019s already there, or creating new situations people haven\u2019t envisioned before?</span></p> <p><span><b>BT: </b>That\u2019s an amazing question. That\u2019s a very good question, because you\u2019re sort of also getting at: does art reflect society or drive it? I think humor faces that same, probably unanswerable question. At the best, you don\u2019t quite know\u2026. I think much more often than not, humor, and specifically art in general, reflects what\u2019s actually the case. But the best of it, and I\u2019m not saying I do this\u2026but at its best, the humorist is so actively and accurately in touch with the zeitgeist, with the actual state of the world, that what they say feels like influence, and feels like prediction, when it\u2019s just really, really, good listening and reframing of something that\u2019s already true.</span></p> <p><span><b>10. FM:</b> What\u2019s the funniest show on TV right now?</span></p> <p><span><b>BT:</b> I really like \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers.\u201d I think it\u2019s not on [the] air technically right now. \u201cCommunity\u201d is really high on my list, it\u2019s funny, funny stuff\u2026. \u201cLouis\u201d is one of my favorite shows. But it\u2019s almost because it\u2019s not always funny, but it\u2019s still always good, that I really like.</span></p> <p><span><b>11. FM:</b> How long did it take to write How To Be Black?</span></p> <p><span><b>BT: </b>It took me about a year.</span></p> <p><span><b>12.\u00a0FM: </b>How would you describe your experience on your book tour?</span></p> <p><span><b>BT:</b> The book tour has been great. I feel like I\u2019m running for president\u2026. What\u2019s been cool is just sort of seeing people\u2019s excitement, seeing people like give folks weird looks for having the book, because the title, it just it jumps out at you. So there are all these photos people posted around the country, like they saw somebody with the book on the subway, like \u201cWhy are you...? Is there a manual for that?

You have a whole chapter on him.</span></p> <p><span><b>BT:</b> Oh man, I want him to. I\u2019m sure he could not be caught in public holding a book called How To Be Black, like all the conspiracy people would be like, \u201cI knew it!

{"title": "Delegate Counting | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In a Republican nominating contest that has been marked by fiery debate performances, Tuesday\u2019s debate, the twentieth and final such event, underwhelmed. No candidate delivered a memorable performance, and the debate lacked the fire that helped resuscitate some campaigns\u2014think Newt Gingrich in South Carolina, for example\u2014or flubs that sank others\u2014think Rick Perry\u2019s \u201coops\u201d moment.</span></p> <p><span>With the floodgates opened on so-called super PAC spending, this nominating cycle has seen an unusual level of menacing attack ads. But the unprecedented number of debates has offered voters an important chance to view their candidates in a (relatively) unscripted situation. Voters have responded in kind, and this year\u2019s debates have received record <a href=\"http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/media-migraine/2012/jan/27/republican-debates-are-big-reality-tv-ratings-winn/\">ratings</a>. So in a race that was supposed to be Mitt Romney\u2019s for the taking, the debates have offered a leveling effect and have contributed to the race\u2019s longevity. Newt Gingrich\u2019s fiery debate performances in South Carolina, for example, were widely credited with his victory in that state, which played no small part in helping his candidacy limp forward.</span></p> <p><span>So if the Republican debates have helped define the race, what impact does Tuesday\u2019s debate have on the remainder of the contest?</span></p> <p><span>Most observers have argued that Romney has the momentum going into next Tuesday\u2019s primaries in Arizona and Michigan, but this week\u2019s debate occurred against the backdrop of a national surge by Rick Santorum, who now has a slim lead in national polls. But Santorum failed to deliver a knock out blow on Tuesday, offering a convoluted response on Congressional ear marks and a rigmarole explanation of why he had chosen to endorse Arlen Spector over Patrick J. Toomey, Sr., his conservative rival, in the 2006 Senate election in his home state of Pennsylvania.</span></p> <p><span>Romney, meanwhile, acquitted himself just well enough and offered a disciplined performance that saw him deliver a few effective jabs at Santorum over his Congressional voting record. To Santorum\u2019s chagrin, Ron Paul continued to play the part of Romney\u2019s unlikely attack dog. Paul delivered the night\u2019s most memorable line when asked by CNN\u2019s John King why he had chosen to air an ad describing Santorum as a fake. \u201cBecause he is a fake,\u201d Paul said, grinning. On a set that resembled a set of school desks, Paul looked like the class prankster who had just made a fool of his teacher and got the entire class to laugh along with him. The only thing missing from Santorum\u2019s embarrassed teacher get-up was his sweater vest. Paul continued to play that role throughout the evening, and Santorum could do little but look on in astonishment as the boyish Constitutionalist ran circles around him.</span></p> <p><span>The issues discussed in Tuesday\u2019s debate, however, did little to set up the Republican candidates for the upcoming contests. The economic portion of Tuesday\u2019s debate was dominated by a discussion over the federal deficit. Jobs seemed to take a backseat as the candidates bickered over one another\u2019s budget-cutting credentials. That did not do the candidates any favors as they head into contests in Michigan and Arizona on Tuesday, which boast a 9.3 and 8.7 percent unemployment rate, respectively.</span></p> <p><span>With the debate being held in Mesa, AZ, there was plenty of red meat served on the immigration question. But no candidate distinguished themselves on the issue, and the debate was a wash on this point as well.</span></p> <p><span>When the debate shifted to social issues, Santorum owned the stage, but Romney turned in an acceptable performance on this point as well. Mystifyingly, no candidate brought up Romney\u2019s shifting position on abortion, and Romney managed to escape unharmed on an issue that many Conservatives have doubted his credibility.</span></p> <p><span>On the Middle East, Romney presented himself as the most statesman-like of the bunch as Santorum continued to pound his steady drumbeat for a war against Iran. Gingrich offered a blistering argument in favor of intervening in Iran, bringing up the historical backdrop of the Holocaust to explain Israeli thinking about an Iranian nuclear bomb. But the moment was an exception in his overall performance, which lacked the fire of his previous performances. As Slate\u2019s John F. Dickerson wryly noted, \u201che sounded like a man who will make mountains of money on the lecture circuit.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>With no defining narrative emerging out of Tuesday\u2019s debate, the time is long past to start looking long and hard at the delegate math of this year\u2019s primary. Romney currently has the lead in delegates, but that lead does not amount to much at this point\u2014only 12 percent of delegates have been divvied up. After Super Tuesday on March 6, 34 percent of delegates will have been decided. While those contests offer the opportunity for a candidate to deliver a knock out blow, polling data indicates that much of the race remains up in the air.</span></p> <p><span>Of the upcoming contests, swing states Michigan and Ohio will be most closely watched. In Michigan, the race is currently in a dead heat. In Ohio, Santorum has the edge. On March 3, in a prelude to Super Tuesday, Washington will hold its GOP caucus, and according to the latest Public Policy Poll, Santorum has an 11 point lead in that state.</span></p> <p><span>But given the state of the race, Super Tuesday appears unlikely to settle the affair. Georgia, which with 76 delegates is the largest state to go to the polls that day, is in a statistical tie according to the latest local poll. However, Mike Huckabee\u2019s win there in 2008 should give hope to Santorum who appeals to a similarly minded religious electorate. Massachusetts, with 41 delegates, will likely go to Romney. In Idaho, with 32 delegates, the state\u2019s significant Mormon population should give Romney a boost, though, according to media reports, Santorum has been generating some buzz in the state in recent weeks. But it is important to note that many of these primaries are proportional, so even if one candidate racks up a series of wins, a challenger could easily limp along and keep accumulating delegates in the hope of staging a late upset in a large state like Texas or California, both of which vote late in the calendar.</span></p> <p><span>While the specter of a brokered convention seems ludicrous, if the candidates continue to amass delegates at about the same pace as they are currently doing, that dream may very well become a reality.</span></p> <p><span>So with the race in flux, the fact that no narrative emerged out of Tuesday\u2019s debate only reflects the state of the Republican nominating process, which now appears headed toward an extended fight not unlike the 2008 Democratic primary. And Tuesday\u2019s debate only exacerbated this problem for all three candidates, as no one was able to craft a moment off of which they could pivot into Super Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span>But is there any way one can find a winner in this mess? Yes\u2014Barack Obama, who can only be watching with glee as his would be opponents destroy one another.</span></p> <p><span><i>Elias J.

{"title": "Road to the Final Four, Day 1 | Sports | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Brian A. Campos", "body": "<p><span>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.\u2014Let me start off by saying that flights from Boston to Albuquerque are not cheap, which forced me (and the Crimson Sports board, with which I tagged along) to travel to Denver, where we rented an SUV to make the picturesque drive to Albuquerque, N.M. Thank you, NCAA committee, for that one, really.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the remote location, I made the trip because I figured that, as a senior, it would be my last chance to go to the NCAA tournament as a current student and root for my own school.</span></p> <p><span>Before earning its tournament berth this year, Harvard had not made it to the Big Dance since 1946, when the NCAA tournament invited only eight teams and was second to the then-bigger NIT.</span></p> <p><span>Not only is this moment truly historic, but it is also a testament to how far the basketball program has come under Crimson coach Tommy Amaker.</span></p> <p><span>In the time I\u2019ve been here at Harvard, I\u2019ve witnessed the drastic transformation, and I wanted to take in the final stage\u2014the NCAA tournament\u2014of such change for myself. Is it worth making my bank account cry as it took a significant hit?</span></p> <p><span>As soon as we arrived today to UNM\u2019s University Arena, otherwise known as \u201cThe Pit,\u201d I was completely sure I had made the right decision to come this far.</span></p> <p><span>The arena was undergoing final preparations for the tournament, though it was already adorned with welcome signs from the NCAA. Inside, the Pit was more majestic than what its nickname implies\u2014the enormous below-ground arena could easily seat 10,000 people, and the basketball court was shining with the big NCAA logo smack in the middle, just like on TV.</span></p> <p><span>As the Crimson writers and photographer went to work, I sat down with Ben Samuels, current Crimson president, to watch the open practices, each of them lasting 40 minutes. A few over a hundred fans were also present to see what the teams stationed in Albuquerque had to offer.</span></p> <p><span>Out came the Montana Grizzlies, and grizzly they were.  A few players had full-grown beards, and they just seemed like a hard-working team straight out of the mountain ranges of that great Northwest state. They could really hit their jumpers, but it will be interesting to see how they will match up athletically with Wisconsin tomorrow. I didn\u2019t stay for the Wisconsin practice, though I imagine they practiced like a No. 3 seed.</span></p> <p><span>Up next was the Harvard Crimson. No longer a journalist for the Crimson, I stood up to cheer loudly along with the cheerleading team, which had made it in time to watch them practice.</span></p> <p><span>Under the bright lights, the Crimson looked really good, which got my hopes up for tomorrow\u2019s win even more. Coach Amaker made his players run a couple of fast-break drills along with some screen plays and shooting practice.</span></p> <p><span>Nothing too strenuous for the 40 minutes they were out there, but the team looked solid and excited to be there. Harvard\u2019s three-point shooting could use a little more work though, which made us debate whether Denver\u2019s altitude may be playing a factor in their shots.</span></p> <p><span>Regardless, that is an excuse that also applies to Vanderbilt, which hails from Tennessee, and, is just an excuse in the end.</span></p> <p><span><b>Some notable tidbits:</b></span></p> <p><span>-\tThe Crimson seemed super excited to be in Albuquerque, and it showed in their fast-paced drills.</span></p> <p><span>-\tThere were a lot of dunks from Casey, Travis, and Saunders, among many other players, in the beginning of the session, which seemed once again to be a product of their excitement.</span></p> <p><span>-\tThe team\u2019s jump shots were falling, but the treys weren\u2019t as much\u2014let\u2019s just hope this goes away by tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span>-\tHarvard\u2019s ball movement and handling was excellent, but then again, this was against an invisible opponent. Turnovers will be a key statistic in tomorrow\u2019s matchup\u2014the Commodores are known to be turnover-prone, which is something the Crimson should take advantage of and convert into points.</span></p> <p><span>-\tAmaker\u2019s team showed a lot of effort during a defensive drill that focused on forcing the opponent to taking a mid-range jump shot. If the shooter missed, Harvard was there ready to grab the rebound. This will be important tomorrow against a team that a) shoots the ball well but b) does not rebound effectively. If Vanderbilt has a poor shooting day and Harvard rebounds well, the Ivy League champion has a real chance at downing the No. 5 seed.</span></p> <p><span>After watching the Crimson practice its free throws and retreat to the locker rooms, Ben and I decided to skip out on the Badgers\u2019 practice for some grub. But we came back just in time to see Vanderbilt practice, and what an underwhelming session it was.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019m pretty sure they spent more time shooting free throws, which most teams do at the end for a couple of minutes, than running plays and drills. The energy just wasn\u2019t there, not from the players nor the coaches. I\u2019m sure Vanderbilt did not want to give away too much during the open practice, but still, it was a little disconcerting how little enthusiasm the squad exuded.</span></p> <p><span>The Commodores did exhibit their shooting proficiency, with senior Jeffery Taylor and junior John Jenkins catching my eye with the number of shots they made.</span></p> <p><span>Festus Ezeli, one of the best centers in the SEC, practiced his post moves and made a fair amount of hook shots. He\u2019s listed as 6\u201911, which surprised me because he did not look like it at all. We\u2019ll see tomorrow when he stands next to Keith Wright.</span></p> <p><span><b>Final tidbits:</b></span></p> <p><span>-\t\u201cI\u2019ll be rooting for Harvard, but it\u2019s just too much of a stretch.\u201d These are the words of our Commander in Chief and Harvard Law School graduate, President Barack Obama. Have some hope, man!</span></p> <p><span>-\tAlbuquerque really loves Los Lobos, its basketball team. Papa John's was selling their apparel, and many signs around the city showed signs of support.</span></p> <p><span>-\tIf Harvard basketball continues its meteoric rise, we\u2019re going to need a Pit of our own. After sitting in UNM\u2019s arena, Lavietes Pavilion, as historic as it is, just does not do it anymore. I can\u2019t wait to visit Chapel Hill or Cameron Indoor one day.</span></p> <p><span>-\tI bought some memorabilia for tomorrow\u2019s game\u2014sorry, bank account.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Professors See Romney As Most Likely Nominee | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Although former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney has won both the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, the upcoming South Carolina and Florida primaries will be critical in determining whether he can maintain his position as the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, Harvard professors say.</span></p> <p><span>Romney, a Harvard Law School and Business School alumnus, won the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday with 39 percent of the vote. Ron Paul, the runner-up, collected only 23 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the wide margin, government professor Theda R. Skocpol said, \u201cI don\u2019t think [New Hampshire] was decisive.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe did what we knew he was going to do all along,\u201d Skocpol said. \u201cSouth Carolina and Florida are the most important [upcoming] primaries.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The winner of the South Carolina Republican primary has gone on to become the party\u2019s presidential nominee in every election since 1980. Coming off the coattails of a win in New Hampshire, Romney is in a strong position headed into the South Carolina and Florida contests on Jan. 21 and Jan. 31.</span></p> <p><span>But Skocpol noted that given South Carolina\u2019s strong conservative leaning, voters in the state may be drawn toward Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, two of Romney\u2019s more conservative opponents in the contest.</span></p> <p><span>In a fundraising letter sent out to supporters on Wednesday, Gingrich emphasized the importance of the South Carolina primary. The letter said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do it next week in South Carolina or he\u2019s almost certain to be the Republican nominee, whether conservatives like us want it or not. It\u2019s up to you, right now.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>For many, however, Romney\u2019s place on the Republican ticket already seems inevitable. According to a Gallup poll, Romney is the first choice among registered Republican voters nationwide. Another Gallup poll found that six in ten registered Republican voters believe that Romney will be their party\u2019s eventual candidate, compared to 11 percent and 8 percent who predict Gingrich and Santorum, respectively, will clinch the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think he\u2019s been the presumptive Republican nominee for a long time simply because there\u2019s been a clear pattern,\u201d Skocpol said. \u201cHe has money, he has a plurality of support, and all of the opponents who might assemble the non-Romney vote are dividing the vote.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Trey Grayson \u201994, the director of Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics, agreed that Romney will likely become the Republican candidate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cObviously from a delegate standpoint, he has a long way to go. But look at his campaign\u2019s financial resources, organizational resources, and endorsements,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cNo one else has emerged as a serious challenger for the nomination. If he finishes first or second in South Carolina, it\u2019ll be hard to beat him in Florida.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Yet pundits have frequently observed a lack of enthusiasm among voters toward Romney\u2019s candidacy.</span></p> <p><span>Antone Martinho III \u201913, who said he is a conservative Republican, agreed with that view. \u201cRepublicans just don\u2019t seem to like Romney,\u201d he said. But he did not see a probable alternative. \u201cIn all honesty, I think Romney\u2019s going to win. If anyone takes him, I think it\u2019ll be Ron Paul.

{"title": "Theory of Occupation | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Two weeks ago, Harvard administrators removed the geodesic dome that had served as the home of Occupy Harvard over winter break, leaving the movement without a physical encampment. The transition Occupy Harvard has undergone\u2014from physical occupation of space to meetings and actions\u2014has taken place at Occupies across the country after evictions by city governments and inclement weather.</span></p> <p><span>This transition has provided urgency to philosophical discussions about the purpose and meaning of Occupy. The conversations on this topic that have taken place among the tents and list-serves of Occupy Harvard often parallel discussions happening elsewhere in the global Occupy movement. They center on what some consider a fundamental question of Occupy: Is it a protest or a community? While those who view Occupy as a protest seek to rectify specific problematic practices, those who see Occupy as a community attempt to model a more just society.</span></p> <p><span>Like many of the students, faculty, and staff who worked to organize some of the first Occupy actions on Harvard\u2019s campus, I originally thought of Occupy Harvard as a protest movement. After months and years of fruitless and frustrating discussions with University administrators about issues like ethical investment and benefit parity for indirectly hired employees, I saw Occupy Harvard as a way to escalate these campaigns. I assumed that rallies and a tent city would put more student, alumni, and media pressure on the University to do the right thing.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, Occupy Harvard has been a very effective protest. It achieved its goal of helping the custodians\u2019 union secure a <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/11/22/harvard-occupy-celebrates-new-contract/\">favorable contract</a> for the next five years. It convinced the University administration to investigate its investment in HEI Hotels and Resorts and to release its first <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/12/16/HEI-Harvard-Labor-Investments-Crimson-Occupy-SLAM/\">statement</a> about ethical endowment investment since 2005. It sparked <a href=\"http://ineteconomics.org/blog/inet/imagining-new-intro-economics\">national discussion </a>about how classical economics is taught in the college setting. It encouraged discussion about the role of Wall Street recruiters on campus and apparently inspired the Phillips Brooks House and Center for Public Interest Careers to host a <a href=\"http://www.publicservice.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k84594&amp;pageid=icb.page474416\">conference</a> on public service careers over Wintersession.</span></p> <p><span>Hopefully, as Occupy Harvard turns its attention to the University\u2019s conflict of interest policies and executive compensations, more positive changes will follow. This is exciting for those frustrated with Harvard administrators\u2019 unresponsiveness to previous student requests.</span></p> <p><span>The global Occupy movement is full of disillusioned citizens who have become frustrated that despite their votes and phone calls, elected officials continue to serve the interests of the upper class and Wall Street instead of passing legislation to help the 99 percent. They, too, have succeeded in changing national discourse about income inequality, sparking political moves like President Obama\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-unveils-student-loan-relief-plan-in-denver-campus-appearance/2011/10/26/gIQAOcDNJM_story.html\">proposal</a> for student debt relief, and countering the actions of big banks by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URoSs20ImZQ\">installing</a> homeless families into vacant homes.</span></p> <p><span>Many, however, view Occupy as more than simply a protest movement. They consider it a community of like-minded people gathering in tents or in rallies who can work together to address fundamental problems in American society, ranging from wealth disparity to racism and sexism.</span></p> <p><span>Occupy Harvard\u2019s physical encampment did create a space on campus where those interested in economic justice could meet each other, reach out, and connect to the larger community. I spent many hours sitting at Occupy Harvard\u2019s Information Desk, where community members ranging from graduate students to Harvard employees would come to talk about their insufficient health care plans, their fears about being laid off, their frustrations with temporary work contracts. They would note to me, \u201cI never had anyone to tell that to before. Thanks for being here.\u201d The tents in the Yard became a symbol of a community at Harvard that was paying attention to inequality and trying to overcome it.</span></p> <p><span>Similarly, some view the global Occupy movement as an experiment in radical democracy. Every Occupy utilizes consensus-based decision making, a democratic process designed to let every single voice be heard, however loud or wealthy. Occupiers try to envision what a better society would look like and construct it in their own tent cities and gatherings.</span></p> <p><span>Some view the distinction between Occupy as protest and Occupy as community as irreconcilable. The conflict has played out in consequential decisions faced by Occupy: for example, Occupy Wall Street has struggled over whether it is more important for the group to focus on planning new actions (focusing on the \u201cprotest\u201d vision of Occupy) or simply finding food and shelter for homeless Occupiers (the \u201ccommunity\u201d vision of Occupy).</span></p> <p><span>However, I believe that protest and community do not exclude each other. Occupy Harvard can work with allies in the administration to organize University-sponsored events about economic inequality (creating a conscious community) while at the same time pressuring the University to change its labor practices and investment policies. Similarly, Occupy movements across the country can form stronger communities while challenging specific corporate or government policies. This combination may let Occupy avoid the inconsistencies of previous social movements like the Civil Rights movement, which ignored blatant chauvinism among its leaders in pursuit of racial justice. In fact, perhaps Occupy could not stand alone as either a protest or a community, and is necessarily both at once.</span></p> <p><span>These two visions of Occupy, as a protest movement and as a new community, may come into opposition as Occupy Harvard creates a vision for its future. However, they need not be radically different, or even in conflict. Existing without a physical encampment allows Occupy Harvard, like Occupations across the country, to explore more fully what, exactly, it wants to be.</span></p> <p><span><i>Sandra Y. L.

Statistics like this would seem to lend some empirical heft to the oft-trumpeted claim that \u201c<a href=\"http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2011/12/13/graph_america_is_a_centerright_nation\">America</a> <a href=\"http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/publications/id.11255/pub_detail.asp\">is</a> a <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/10/17/it-s-not-easy-bein-blue.html\">center-right</a> <a href=\"http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2011/08/01/us-center-right/\">nation</a>.\u201d There is a serious problem in using data like the Gallup Political Ideologies Poll as evidence that Americans lean right. Since the poll relies exclusively on self-identification, it tells us much more about the comparative popularity of particular labels than it does about the actual policy preferences of Americans. The language of political identity is as subject to the whims of fashion as the length of men\u2019s basketball shorts. The term \u201cliberal\u201d has undergone especially breakneck changes in popularity that would make even Britney Spears delirious.</span></p> <p><span>In 1949, Harvard professor Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. \u201938 published \u201cThe Vital Center\u201d, a sort of blueprint for what we would now call post-war liberalism.\u00a0 Schlesinger imagined liberalism as a fundamentally moderate doctrine to temper the extremities of hard-line leftism and reactionary rightism. Liberalism was wise moderation\u2014an essential alternative to both the outmoded free-market conservatism of the Coolidge Republicans and the anti-individualistic ideology of the far-left.\u00a0 The electoral success of self-proclaimed liberals like Roosevelt and Johnson evidenced the ideology\u2019s popularity. In 1966, liberalism was so vogue that the folk musician Phil Ochs penned \u201cLove me, I\u2019m a liberal,\u201d a satirical piece about conservatives masquerading as liberals because it was the popular thing to do.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone accusing today\u2019s self-described liberals of hidden conservatism. Today, \u201cliberal\u201d is most commonly hurled as an epithet at politicians like President Obama who parry the accusation by eschewing the stigmatized word for the more benign \u201cprogressive.\u201d If Gallup tells us anything, it\u2019s that most Americans run from liberalism.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard (like many college campuses) is a place that bucks the national trend.\u00a0 It almost goes without saying that the median Harvard student, if given a choice between self-describing as liberal or conservative, would chose liberal without too much thought.\u00a0 Furthermore, Harvard\u2019s liberals seem, by and large, to be aware of their leftward boundary in a way that belies their frequent caricature.\u00a0 Yet our community has not been immune to changes in the nature of the term \u201cliberal\u201d that go beyond its transformation to a pejorative.</span></p> <p><span>A conservative friend of mine tells me routinely that our communist friend is \u201csuper liberal,\u201d to which I respond, \u201cShe\u2019s not liberal; she\u2019s communist.\u201d Yet, to most contemporary Americans, there\u2019s nothing at all odd about referring to communists as \u201cmore liberal\u201d than liberals, although this was not always the case. There was a time when you could be (and many were) too far left to be called liberal. During the Korean War, for example, no one would have said that the Maoists were \u201cmore liberal\u201d than Harry Truman.\u00a0 \u201cLiberal\u201d did not apply to all ideologies on the left, much the same way that \u201cconservative\u201d does not apply to all ideologies on the right (was Hitler really \u201cconservative?\u201d).</span></p> <p><span>There\u2019s more at stake here than semantic drift. Although Americans probably have gotten more conservative in their policy preferences since midcentury, it\u2019s also true that the term \u201cliberal\u201d has changed. It would be wrong to say just that it has moved left, because those leaders who were liberal in the \u201840s are still considered liberal today.\u00a0 Rather, it has been stretched to include not only its original ideological territory, but also the far reaches of the radical left. As a consequence, it has garnered the distaste that comes with radical leftism in America.</span></p> <p><span>Many who might have espoused liberalism and its various tenets if it still denoted a discreet identity with a leftward bound have opted instead to identify as \u201cmoderate\u201d or even \u201cconservative.\u201d Their dispositional preferences for steadiness outweigh their would-be support for genuinely left-wing policies. And unfortunately for those of us still holding down the liberal fort, people choose their politics in packages.\u00a0 A person who is drawn to moderation (or merely away from hard leftism) today identifies as a \u201cmoderate,\u201d and seems required to take a different posture towards, say, the capital gains tax than she would if liberalism were still attractive to the dispositionally moderate .</span></p> <p><span>How did liberalism come to connote both moderate leftism and radicalism, thereby alienating would-be liberals with a penchant for the moderate aesthetic?\u00a0 The most likely candidate is the Vietnam War.\u00a0 Liberalism\u2019s old guard lost all credibility through the blind escalation in Vietnam and paved the way for a New Left that opposed to the policy of containment and that placed addressing the root causes of crime\u2014such as poverty and racism\u2014ahead of law and order.\u00a0 This, together with typical right-wing cunning, allowed conservatives to paint liberals as soft on defense and crime.</span></p> <p><span>On the other hand, conservatives have lost public responsibility for reactionaries. Even the mildest suggestion that there are lingering racist factions on the American right draws unparalleled indignation from conservatives.\u00a0 It\u2019s rather unfair that liberals have had to take on the baggage of the far left. In response, so-called progressives ought to reclaim the liberal mantle and push back: after all, Castro is not \u201cmore liberal\u201d than anybody.</span></p> <p><span><i>Michael F.

{"title": "Liars and Politicians | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>What is an unmet promise called? Per our colloquial phrasing, a promise not kept is deemed \u201cbroken,\u201d a subtle linguistic reminder of our reverence for the oath. That esteem for the promise exists throughout our culture. In the Bible, Moses <a href=\"http://www.usccb.org/bible/numbers/30\">exhorts</a>, \u201cWhen a man\u2026 binds himself under oath to a pledge, he shall not violate his word.\u201d In the legal arena, common law long prohibited \u201cbreach of promise,\u201d holding would-be husbands accountable for unfulfilled ring-giving (a practice that, be advised, still <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,415341,00.html\">sits</a> on the books in some states). And at the edge of the great abyss, Robert Frost, that great American poet, famously reminded himself, \u201cBut I have promises to keep.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Incidentally, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., partial to that ethos of promise-keeping, borrowed Robert Frost\u2019s words for his <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Promises-Keep-Politics-Joe-Biden/dp/product-description/1400065364/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&amp;n=283155&amp;s=books\">autobiography</a>, titled \u201cPromises to Keep.\u201d Support or opposition for Mr. Biden aside, that emphasis on keeping promises seems absurd when fused with the sphere of politics. Because politicians are liars. That is evident. Disenchanted voters recall a history littered with broken campaign promises. They remember the elder Bush\u2019s infamous illiteracy with respect to his own lips. And they recall not only ignored but impossible promises too, like the 1987 <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Hawke-regrets-child-poverty-comment/2007/06/16/1181414583336.html\">vow</a> from Bob J. L. Hawke, ex-P.M. Down Under, to end Australian child poverty by 1990. (<a href=\"http://www.fightpoverty.mmbrico.com/facts/australia.html\">Today</a>, one in seven Australian children lives in poverty; Mr. Hawke has since publicly <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Hawke-regrets-child-poverty-comment/2007/06/16/1181414583336.html\">regretted</a> the promise.) A truism: politicians break their promises.</span></p> <p><span>That pattern, unlike the style of men\u2019s basketball shorts, does not seem to have improved since the late 1980s. According to PolitiFact.com\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/\">Obameter</a>,\u201d President Barack Obama and the veracity-minded Mr. Biden have met their 506 campaign promises (yes, 506) at a paltry 31 percent clip, with a mere 6-for-25 record on \u201cTop Promises.\u201d Similarly, the corresponding \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/gop-pledge-o-meter/\">G.O.P Pledge-O-Meter</a>\u201d lists a 29 percent \u201cPromise Kept\u201d rate for the 2010 Republican class in Congress. Those wavering records seem logical. Politicians, for one, have an incentive to exaggerate, with the intent of wooing potential voters. And on top of that, different constituencies for primary versus general elections can encourage insouciant flip-flopping. But just how malleable, exactly, is a politician\u2019s word?</span></p> <p><span>About one-third malleable, to be precise. At least, that follows the findings of a 1985 book-length study by Jeff Fishel, professor emeritus at American University. In examining U.S. presidents from Kennedy to Reagan, Fishel found a promise-keeping <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/promises-to-keep-20080719\">rate</a> of 66 percent, if\u2014importantly\u2014a stymied but real attempt to keep a promise counts as a success. (Other work has confirmed and extended this record, to <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/promises-to-keep-20080719\">70 percent</a> or even <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/january_february_2012/features/campaign_promises034471.php\">three-fourths</a>.) In line with that \u201cA for effort\u201d approach, PolitiFact\u2019s scores for Mr. Obama and the G.O.P. rise to 66 percent and 77 percent, respectively, when \u201cin the works\u201d legislation counts positively. Two-thirds is far from perfect. But, as Rutgers political scientist Gerald M. Pomper <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/promises-to-keep-20080719\">points out</a>, compared to America\u2019s one-in-two divorce rate, those scores are \u201cpretty good.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And, besides, 100 percent may be less than desirable. Mr. Bush\u2019s lip-reading and his successor\u2019s \u201cmost ethical administration in history\u201d do not constitute the only reneged presidential assurances. The 1940 Roosevelt campaign <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/fdr-churchill/\">promised</a> a refrain from entry into war, a promise wisely revoked after December 7th, a year later. Lincoln promised to preserve slavery in the Southern states, and even endorsed an amendment to accomplish just that (\u201cI have no objection to [such an amendment\u2019s] being made express and irrevocable\u201d \u2014Abraham Lincoln, first inaugural <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres31.html\">address</a>). That fell away in an 1863 proclamation. Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Democratic-Republicans unwound their small-government, Constitutionalist promises long enough to acquire the Louisiana Territory. In 1844, James K. Polk promised a reduced tariff, a resolution of Oregon\u2019s borders, and the annexation of California. And, well, James K. Polk <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/02/news/OE-ELLIS2/2\">actually</a> delivered on all three. But the most famous James Polk memorial is in Pineville, North Carolina. Not Washington, D.C.</span></p> <p><span>So, we have a few helpful\u2014at least, palliative\u2014lessons. Yes, sometimes politicians break promises. Sometimes they shatter them in a memorable, sharded frenzy. But, more often than not, they do their best\u2014or do something, at a minimum\u2014to follow through on those promises. Despite a world of ephemeral, present-minded concerns, of shifting, archipelagic interest-groups, and of often depthless media flaring, politicians generally stand by their word. And in times when they do not, it may even prove for the better.</span></p> <p><span>The longtime politician Nikita S. Khrushchev (who, perhaps not via promise-keeping, regularly <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=fJNvFlz16hUC&amp;pg=PT156&amp;lpg=PT156&amp;dq=khrushchev+election+vote&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lCDc0gQVwl&amp;sig=0PlravyatAftUpqsNdEBeSC0CPI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wDMLT7jEDcbL0QH0-PjaBg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=khrushchev%20election%20vote&amp;f=false\">secured</a> a 90 to 100 percent vote for his party) <a href=\"http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/n/nikita_khrushchev.html\">warned</a>, \u201cPoliticians are the same all over. They promise to build bridges even when there are no rivers.\u201d The latter sentence seems wittily instructive, but the first might not be true. Politicians are not \u201cthe same all over.\u201d One glance at the 2012 field, for both parties, shows a wide gamut not just of policy options, but of personalities and of values. A glance at history yields the same. Some politicians are more malleable, more inconsistent. Some are reliable rocks. Many politicians fall somewhere in between. And some, no matter what they promise you, will still roll the Red Army into Hungary.</span></p> <p><span><i> </i></span></p> <p><span><i>Brian L.

{"title": "Follow The Money | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Among President Obama\u2019s numerous declarations during the State of the Union last week, one of the more noteworthy commitments he made was to <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/1/26/obama-state-union-professors/\">increasing the affordability of higher education</a>. In reference to the ballooning costs of attending college, Obama highlighted one of the central problems that face America\u2019s young adult population\u2014the increasing cost of a college degree in a society increasingly demanding one. While this is the unfortunate result of a myriad of factors, the current federal aid system is insufficient to ameliorate these issues and must be improved.</span></p> <p><span>Ultimately, a federal solution is necessary to combat the outsized costs of an education; the government must take the initiative to dramatically increase the federal aid it provides to universities, particularly public universities. These institutions currently offer some of the most economical options to the largest number of people. By providing these institutions and their students more financial support, the government will not only encourage more individuals to pursue a college degree using the route that is already the most common, but it will also make it more financially palatable for those who have already decided to do so.</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, there are other immediate steps the government can take to help prospective students achieve long-term financial success. One of the administration\u2019s primary goals should be to demystify the confusion surrounding the benefits of a college education. High school seniors are currently fed copious amounts of information about the merits of a bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degree from a plethora of (often self-interested) sources. This marketing instills the erroneous belief that an expensive degree is tantamount to an assurance of future prosperity, regardless of the skills actually acquired as a student. This is patently false. For reasons beyond anyone\u2019s control, the market for graduates with degrees outside the realms of math and science is smaller than the market for those with more quantitative skills. As such, students should be encouraged at least to explore options in fields whose skills are likely to be the most relevant after college.</span></p> <p><span>This is not to diminish the academic, cultural, or social value of any academic field. In a perfect world, everyone would have the luxury of studying whatever one wished without it affecting his or her future salary. However, to pretend it is acceptable to bet hundreds of thousands of dollars on a degree without regards to its content ignores reality, The government should push back against the myth that all degrees are equally marketable and strive to educate students on the different opportunities different degrees confer.</span></p> <p><span>Another measure the federal government can take to decrease student debt would be engaging in a widespread crackdown on for-profit colleges. In the struggle to increase college affordability, some of the most shameful offenders are these institutions. Many of these colleges violate not only the spirit, but also the letter of the law, engaging in practices such as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/education/commercial-colleges-broke-rules-in-us-inquiry.html?ref=forprofitschools\">accepting fraudulent high school credentials</a> and plagiarized coursework, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-04/for-profit-colleges-boiler-room-recruiting-described-at-senate-hearing.html\">lying about the cost of degrees</a>, and allegedly <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/opinion/an-industry-in-need-of-accountability.html?ref=forprofitschools\">paying admissions officers</a> to increase enrollment. Many are guilty of bait-and-switch tactics to entice students to matriculate. Recently, bureaucratic progress had been made towards properly regulating the for-profit college industry. However, as a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/10/us/politics/for-profit-college-rules-scaled-back-after-lobbying.html?ref=forprofitschools\">result of heavy lobbying</a>, many of these changes have been scaled back. This is wholly unacceptable. The goals of turning a profit and providing an education are incompatible and should not intersect.</span></p> <p><span>That said, for-profit institutions are by no means the sole culprit. A host of schools, many of which receive taxpayer dollars (through either Pell Grants or direct funding), report what many would consider unacceptably low graduation rates. For example, the ten schools with the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/college-inc/post/the-10-lowest-college-graduation-rates-in-dc-md-and-va/2011/12/13/gIQAnfSVsO_blog.html\">lowest federally reported graduation rates in the Washington D.C. area</a> include nonprofit as well as for-profit institutions. The department of education needs to reevaluate its financial relationship with schools that consistently fail to graduate students, regardless of profit or nonprofit status. While it may seem harsh, the government should not continue to spend money on failed or failing institutions that could be used elsewhere unless those schools can provide a credible means to improve performance. Such measures are reasonable as families are not bound by location to a specific college like they would be to a high school or elementary school, removing any obligation the government has to provide educational opportunity based on proximity. Committing funds to one school instead of another is a mutually exclusive activity; such money should not be wasted.</span></p> <p><span>The United States government has many tools at its disposal to reduce student debt, but it must begin with increasing federal aid to schools that could use it most.</span></p>"}

The Navy can have a similar effect on green energy by increasing demand, he said.</span></p> <p><span>Mabus also commented on the significance of Harvard\u2019s decision to bring back Naval ROTC. The military withdrew from campus in 1969 amidst student and faculty protests against the Vietnam War.

{"title": "Thatcher, Republicans, and Conviction Politics | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As Hollywood\u2019s awards season builds to its glamorous finale, actress Meryl Streep has garnered critical acclaim for her role in The Iron Lady. In the film, Streep portrays the groundbreaking and controversial former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who has been characterized through the years by her staunch conservatism as much as her trademark hairstyle. Perhaps in part due to the film, the polarizing and decisive Thatcher has regained a place in both the popular and political consciousness, most notably in the Republican primary race, where candidates have held up Thatcher as an ideal leader. Thatcher\u2019s career was shaped by conviction politics, meaning that she campaigned and governed with an emphasis on principle and adherence to ideology regardless of the cost. A brand of politics similar to the one she espoused has resurged, especially within the Grand Old Party. Such politics have their benefits, among them bolstering the support of a party\u2019s base. But as Thatcher\u2019s example shows, and as Republicans would be wise to take note of, conviction politics have their limits.</span></p> <p><span>During her short-lived campaign, Congresswoman Michele Bachmann used Thatcher as a paragon of conservative female virtue, voicing her aspiration to be <a href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2012/01/01/Thatcher-The-Iron-Lady-Inspires-GOP-Candidates.aspx#page1\">America\u2019s own Iron Lady</a>. Bachmann\u2019s references to Thatcher had the added obvious benefit of tying the former candidate to a high-profile, accomplished conservative woman who held her country\u2019s highest office. Thatcher is the figure that Bachmann\u2019s supporters wished she had turned out to be: a smart, tough, and galvanizing conservative woman, poised to lead conservatives out of their latest wilderness.</span></p> <p><span>Other Republicans have also praised Thatcher for her conservatism. They use references to her as a simple way to attach themselves to a proud conservative tradition, replacing \u201cReagan\u201d with \u201cThatcher\u201d when the former name seems overused. Of course, Bachmann\u2019s prolific references had limited success in producing electoral victory using Thatcher\u2019s legacy. Nonetheless, it is easy to see why Republicans on a larger scale have gravitated to the Iron Lady, who earned her nickname from her tough opposition to communism and underscored it with firm leadership through the 1980s.</span></p> <p><span>The primary race is now devoid of a possible American Iron Lady, but much of the GOP still wants a comparable male nominee to oppose President Barack Obama in November. They want someone with a consistent record as a constitutional, fiscal, and social conservative who is unwilling to compromise right-wing principles in any context. This largely explains why the relatively liberal Mitt Romney has not yet been able to wrap up his party\u2019s nomination. Despite his proven ability to fundraise, organize, and present a platform likely appealing to general election voters, he has faced continued opposition from those like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich who are seen as more unapologetically conservative. The rest of the Republican field has appeared more proud and forthcoming than Romney in their respective political convictions, including the libertarian ones of Ron Paul, and they have all benefited from preaching the gospel of conviction politics, gaining support and slowing what had once been seen as Romney\u2019s all but guaranteed run for the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Conviction politics carry appeal with a large segment of today\u2019s Republican voters, but they are unlikely to have such a strong resonance with general election voters. That is not to say that conviction politics can never win races. As the 2010 midterm elections demonstrated with the influx of Tea Party-associated candidates into Congress, displaying unwillingness to compromise can bring electoral success. But this success is often highly limited, particularly when it comes to actual governance. Conviction politics are at the heart of major problems with how the US government, specifically Congress, works. Lack of compromise between the two major parties has resulted in less effective legislation being passed and the popular perception that the parties are too wrapped up in politics, bickering, and ideologies to listen to the American people and do what is best for the country.</span></p> <p><span>There is no doubt that Margaret Thatcher was a bold, trailblazing leader whose controversial legacy will live on. Her relentless dedication to conservative values both drove her rise and prompted her downfall, creating divisions between her, the British people, and her own party. Conviction politics in the right place at the right moment can excite an electoral base and sweep a party into power. But they have their limits as well. They can be polarize, stall legislative progress, and create the kind of political environment that we have today. As Republicans look to Thatcher and other conservative lions, they would do well to recognize that there is more to effective governance than unwavering adherence to an ideology. Compromise is vital.</span></p> <p><span><i>Morgan Wilson \u201814 is a history concentrator in Currier House.</i></span></p>"}

We are home to Bible studies, queer organizations, religious associations, and labor-rights groups.\u00a0 Even the faculty is more intellectually diverse than every. Our largest course, Ec 10, is headed by arguably the nation\u2019s most prominent right-wing economist, Gregory Mankiw. The University is also home to left-wing luminaries like Roberto Unger. Perhaps the real issue at hand is that Santorum seems to consider the free flow of ideas to be malignant to society.\u00a0 A university that fit his bill would likely be more prone to indoctrination than any current American university.\u00a0 Harvard maintains a high standard of freedom, allowing a veritable intellectual Noah\u2019s Ark to flourish on campus.</span></p> <p><span>The fact of the matter is that things Santorum considers to be the trappings of leftism, like available <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/08/rick-santorum-birth-control_n_1192953.html\">birth control</a> and respect for queer individuals, are in fact just the basic requirements of a decent, modern community.\u00a0 Today, a majority of Americans <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/147662/first-time-majority-americans-favor-legal-gay-marriage.aspx\">support</a> gay marriage, and unrestricted access to contraception has been the law of the land since, well, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_v._Connecticut\">1965</a>. It is Santorum\u2019s views that live on the fringe of the American ideological landscape. Our universities, while perhaps a couple notches to the left of the general population, are its intellectual bazaar. They are a cross section of our national community and are vital to our culture.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, there is another troubling implication of Santorum\u2019s statement. Considering that blue-collar jobs are disappearing from America\u2019s shores, we must come to terms with the economic imperative of a highly educated workforce. Santorum, in discouraging students from pursuing higher education, has shown his willingness to sacrifice our economic welfare at the altar of right-wing extremism. President Obama is right: We need more, not fewer, students in higher education.</span></p> <p><span>As evidence for his statement, Santorum mentioned a vague statistic that \u201c62 percent of children who enter college with a faith conviction leave without it.\" Even if we are to take Santorum\u2019s statistic at face value, it is hardly instructive. Correlation is most certainly not causation, and to presume that universities are faith-killers ignores the high possibility that other factors motivate the change. Perhaps the students who choose to leave home for college are generally less deeply religious than their peers. Or maybe 18-23 year-olds, regardless of higher education, become less religious than those below them in age.</span></p> <p><span>Colleges aren\u2019t places of \u201cliberal indoctrination\u201d, they are a great resource of intellectual freedom that play a key role in keeping the United States economically viable. In the future, hopefully Santorum will consider these sorts of things more heavily before making policy prescriptions.</span></p> <p><span><a href=\"#_msoanchor_1\"></a></span></p>"}

That year, he lost the state to former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.
