{"title": "Vive la Difference | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Once every four years, the Mr. Hyde in Arthur Schlesinger emerges and he abandons the genteel ivory towers of scholarship for the noisy partisan rigors of politics.  This year, according to Mr. Nixon, he and his fellow triumvirs Galbraith and Bowles have also deserted the Democratic Party.  Mr. Nixon weeps, \"The Democratic Party of Jefferson, Jackson, and Wilson is not the Democratic Party of Schlesinger, Galbraith and Bowles.\"  Kennedy's three top advisors have led him astray into a morass of \"liberalism\" and huge government spending, and, if one is to believe the vice-President, America can not and will not accept this unholy trio.  Unfortunately, Professor Schlesinger has chosen to reply in kind.</span></p> <p><span><i>Kennedy or Nixon:  Does It Make Any Difference?</i>  Mr. Schlesinger's most recent literary contribution to the campaign, will not enhance his status in the Republican Party; nor, however, is it likely to endear him to those who want to raise the level of the campaign.  A wildly partisan essay, <i>Kennedy or Nixon?</i>  adds nothing substantially new to the campaign, and tends to detract from Mr. Schlesinger's reputation as an historian.  In a brief foreword, the professor confesses his political bias, but adds, \"I will rest my argument whenever possible on hard and verifiable facts; and my way, I hope, will be the way of reasoned analysis.\"  This is the historian's gambit, but the professor is so deeply committed to the Kennedy cause that he overlooks logical inconsistencies, relies on the unsupported generalization, and allows himself to stoop to political smear tactics.</span></p> <p><span>Even to a strong Kennedy supporter like this reviewer, the belief that Nixon is the incarnation of evil and Kennedy all that is good is at best a rather naive generalization.  The point of Mr. Schlesinger's little essay is to repudiate the invidious popular notion that there is very little difference between the nominees.</span></p> <p><span>In his concentrated attack on the vice-President, Schlesinger scores some very decisive points.  He successfully illustrates that Mr. Nixon can conveniently hold two opposing sides of the same issue and come out unscathed by public opinion.  And the wholesale indictment of Nixon's lack of taste (\"an instinct for dignity\") is being proved almost every day by Mr. Nixon without any help at all from Professor Schlesinger.</span></p> <p><span>But Schlesinger is on more dubious ground in his exploration of Mr. Nixon's personality.  One must assume that the professor is not exactly an intimate friend of Dick Nixon, and that he is psychoanalyzing him through public statements--which is a questionable method of probing anyone's psyche, especially a politician's.  That Nixon has no political philosophy is perhaps true, but that he is an \"other-directed\" man who has no sense of his identity is an interesting but dubious conclusion.  It is true that Nixon is extremely concerned with his \"image\" (what politician is not) and that he overplays the \"humble bit,\" but how in the world would Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. know that the vice-President has not solved his \"identity crisis\"?</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy on the other hand is a friend of the author and hence the rather doubtful procedure of psychoanalysis here has more validity.  But for Mr. Schlesinger, Kennedy can do no wrong.  If the Massachusetts Senator has changed his views, this is not Nixon duplicity, but a resolution of his own identity.  This has an element of truth since Kennedy's record has been one of a consistent growth towards a liberal position.  Yet the reader is definitely aware that the two men are not being judged by the same standard.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy, to Professor Schlesinger, is a \"committed liberal.\"  But Schlesinger is careful to point out that Kennedy is not the typical flag-waving liberal, but rather comes to liberalism by intellectual analysis.  It is just this seeming lack of deep moral and emotional commitment to liberalism that worried Mr. Burns and that still plagues the unfortunate Stevensonians at whom much of this book is obviously aimed.</span></p> <p><span>The crucial difference between the candidates lies not so much in their personalities as in their policies and their parties, and yet Mr. Schlesinger devotes only a little more than a quarter of his polemic to this aspect of the campaign.  For it is here that Schlesinger can score his strongest points without resort to the genteel smear and doubtful psychoanalytic generalizations.  Those who argue that Kennedy and Nixon stand for the same things simply have not been following the campaign.</span></p> <p><span>This section of the book comes closer to being the \"reasoned analysis\" promised in the foreword.  The different views on the state of the nation are amplified with recent statements by the two candidates.  And the conflict between the two parties is supported by a thumbnail historical digression.  Further, the tone of this portion of the essay is, for the most part, clearly less inflammatory.</span></p> <p><span>This is a book that has and will continue to delight Kennedy supporters everywhere.  But will it convince the Stevensonians and the undecided voters?  Probably not, simply because it is the same kind of partisan literature, albeit better written, that can be found at any Kennedy headquarters.  Unfortunately, the author's case <i>against</i> Nixon is stronger than his arguments <i>for</i> Kennedy, and Adlai's fans, although they will not vote for Nixon, are searching for reasons which, in good conscience, will allow them to support Kennedy.</span></p> <p><span>Yet this essay is a wholly worthwhile attempt.  Those disgruntled liberals, particularly in New York and California, who are threatening not to vote because they cannot see any difference between the two men, are blinded by their own tears.  While these distinctions may not be as black and white as Schlesinger presents them, they are nonetheless very real.  It is regrettable that the author's almost fanatical devotion to Kennedy tends to obscure them in rash political rhetoric.</span></p> <p><span>In short, <i>Kennedy or Nixon?</i>  is a brilliant piece of campaign propaganda.  But sloppy and blindly partisan reasoning render it almost useless as a handbook for the discriminating undecided voter upon whom, if the pundits are right, the election depends.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Now the Democrats | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It is a common enough allegation that a political platform is rarely more than a hazy frame, something like a television screen, behind which the all-important personality of a candidate assumes greater luster.  I suspect that Mr. Nixon's newly acquired frame is just that, for the very good reason that he has had to fight off too many of his party's various wings to produce anything more substantial.</span></p> <p><span>Senator Kennedy's platform is a far more subtle, and far more interesting document.  Inevitably, it contains the dreary platitudes, the extravagant promises, and the baseless accusations at the opposition that the tolerant convention watcher has learned to expect.  It reflects at the same time something of which many of the delegates to Los Angeles may not entirely have been aware:  the genuine dissatisfaction of their party's intellectuals with the torpor in their society.</span></p> <p><span>Some of these men (like Chester Bowles and John Kenneth Galbraith) helped to draft the Democratic platform, and occasionally the eloquence of their unhappiness gives the lie to the visions of mindless utopia cast by the rest of it.  \"We have drifted into a national mood that accepts payola and quiz scandals, tax evasion and false expense accounts. . . exploitation of sadistic violence as public entertainment,\" they tell us.  The presence of these words in the platform implies that President Eisenhower's administration has been responsible for all these, just as Frank Church suggested in his keynote address that the Republicans had been spending Federal funds on deodorants instead of slum clearance or schools.</span></p> <p><span>It is unlikely that Kennedy and his associates believe in either of these implications, any more than they believe in any \"simple solutions to the infinitely complex challenges which face us.\"  Yet for the most part, the solutions they outline in the platform are simple indeed, curses for only peripheral evils.</span></p> <p><span>The platform pledges to raise the minimum wage to $1.25 an hour, to institute programs of loans and scholarship grants to students, to oppose \"right to work\" laws and the admission of Red China to the United Nations.  This much, presumably, a Democratic Administration would be able to do, but its broader aspirations are not at all so easy to realize.  It speaks (for example) offhandedly of \"policies\" that will ensure a yearly economic growth of five per cent \"without inflation.\"</span></p> <p><span>This intriguing dreaminess is, of course, harmless, but other Democratic planks are less so.  The traditional clear-the-rascals-out clause is particularly ill-considered; it reads \"We shall reform the processes of government in all branches . . . we will clean out corruption and conflicts of interest and improve Government service.\"  This is the sort of thing for which Harry Truman very properly reprimanded Adlai Stevenson in 1952; surely there is no longer any need either to invoke or to exorcise the Jenner-McCarthy spirit.</span></p> <p><span>With a name like \"The Rights of Man,\" the platform could hardly treat the rights of Negroes lightly, and it is evident that it takes them very seriously indeed.  It even mentions a year--1963--by which it plans to see at least first-step compliance with the Supreme Court's integration ruling in every affected school district.  The foreign policy plank is made of equally stout stuff, giving the singularly honest assurance that \"if meetings at high level offer prospects of success, we will be there.\"</span></p> <p><span>Unlike Nixon, Kennedy and his fellow Democratic Senators have known what they wanted for some time.  They admit quite candidly that they want to pass all the bills the President vetoed during the last eight years, and quite a few more besides.  They want to see what the Federal government can do for the unemployed, the Negro, the slum-dweller and the old man (not the \"senior citizen\"), if it really puts its mind and money to it.  The Democrats do not, it appears, regard GOP warnings that this kind of behavior reduces the freedom of the individual with any great seriousness.</span></p> <p><span>The platform's lonely plaints about the dissoluteness of much of the United States convey quite clearly the authors' views that individual freedom is more than freedom from federal legislation.  They would much rather equate freedom with a phrase they use frequently, \"human dignity,\" and understandably do not consider padding expense accounts, exploiting latent sadism, or refusing to serve Negroes particularly dignified.</span></p> <p><span>Despite their platform's apparent air of confidence, they have no more idea than I do whether they can use it to achieve their ideal of dignity.  Their nominee's delineation of a \"New Frontier\" and his pleas for \"sacrifice\" suggests that they are going to try.</span></p>"}

{"title": "A Lively Corpse | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>There is something about a Presidential candidate, even if you don't particularly like him, that makes you stop and look around when he goes by.  The truth of this was demonstrated last week when vice-President Richard M. Nixon stormed Boston in a whirlwind visit.  Although Nixon was more than 30 minutes late, thus neatly missing the rush hour, and although the weather was cold and rainy, an estimated quarter of a million people jammed the streets of downtown Boston to get a look at the Republican nominee.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, that figure of 250,000 has to be examined before its import can be told.  In the first place, it was one of those not-too-reliable sheriff's estimates.  (\"Well, Sheriff, how many people do you think we've got here?\"  \"Wall, I don't rightly recollect ever seeing so many before, but it must be at least 50,000.\")  In the press bus during the motorcade's progress, Boston newsmen made guesses ranging from 100,000 to 200,000, but the final figure, arrived at by two police officials, was 250,000.  \"The important thing is that we all get the same number,\" one reporter said.  \"In the old days, everybody used to fight for news, but we've learned to work together.\"</span></p> <p><span>Then there is the simple fact that not all of the supposed 250,000 like Nixon, or at least that not all were intending to vote for him.  There were some Kennedy placards--one at the Statler Hotel read, \"We Want Kennedy.  Go Home\"--but not very many.  And there was the usual percentage of concerned but ineligible college youth and screamy little kids.  But, even with all this taken into consideration, there was an unexpectedly large number of Nixon supporters on a miserable day in Sen.  Kennedy's home state.  The 6,000 paid-up diners at Thursday night's $100-a-plate soiree should have only solidified what the events of the early evening had already told uneasy Kennedy men--that perhaps Kennedy's apparent intention not to return to Massachusetts until the night before the election is taking an awful lot for granted.</span></p> <p><span>It is possible that the local Republican slate, or at least the top of it, may have helped to draw the large crowd and may even aid Nixon in November.  Sen. Saltonstall and John Volpe, the GOP candidate for Governor, met Nixon at the airport.  Saltonstall and Nixon posed for a picture with arms slung over each other's shoulders, while Volpe, who could go down in history as the Commonwealth's shortest Governor, jumped and craned his neck behind them.  Both Saltonstall and Volpe had their hands full as the motorcade passed through the downtown shopping district.</span></p> <p><span>Saltonstall still seemed to be amazingly popular with Bostonians, although it is hard to say why.  He seems to be a nice enough old duck, without glaring faults or shining virtues.  When the motorcade reached the Statler-Hilton, Salty stood unnoticed, without even a police escort, while the crowd mobbed Nixon.  Once Nixon was safely inside the hotel, however, the throng feel on the Senator with the affection of a mother for her long-lost son.  One beefy fan kept pounding Saltonstall on the back and shouting, \"Hey look!  It's Salty!  How are ya, Salty?\"  Such is the love of the people of Massachusetts for Leverett Saltonstall.</span></p> <p><span>At the dinner, Saltonstall said some very nice things about Nixon, and the vice-President responded by declaring at one point, \"Massachusetts needs Leverett Saltonstall.  I would change that to <i>America</i> needs Leverett Saltonstall.\"  The Republicans displayed an interesting slate, including Secretary of State nominee Edward W. Brooke, the first Negro in the Commonwealth to run for state-wide office, and Augustus Means, the extremely young-looking Junior Chamber of Commercetype candidate for Lieutenant Governor.  There was someone to please everybody, and it was a not unattractive lineup.</span></p> <p><span>Nixon himself looked suntanned and genial, and showed his extreme polish in impromptu speeches at the airport and en route to the Statler.  His addresses to the local dinner and to the nation over closed-circuit TV were hard-hitting and effective; he seems to have refined most of the corn out of his talks, at least in Boston.  In general, the impression was strong that the Republicans are not dead in Massachusetts.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Pachyderm Platform | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last spring, Vice-President Nixon was looking for a platform.  He was practically assured of the Republican nomination; he had gained a good deal of support from unexpected quarters, and he had managed to lose much of his reputation for trickiness.  All he lacked was something to say.</span></p> <p><span>Now he has found what he wanted, and it is exactly the sort of thing one might have expected.  Although how he went about finding it is shrouded in fogs thicker than Chicago's own, it is clear at least that the platform is his, not Goldwater's, or Eisenhower's, or even Rockefeller's.  The reason for this also is obvious enough:  Nixon is neither a Goldwater nor a Rockefeller, and he has had to step adroitly to keep out of trouble with both wings of his party.</span></p> <p><span>The platform, contrary to what one might be led to believe by the Vice-President's recent frenetic rushing to and from the Governor's Manhattan apartment and the White House, was probably not spun out of a few creative minds on the eve of its approval by the convention.  It is unlikely, for instance, that Nixon asked for a stronger civil rights plank simply because Senator Kennedy selected Senator Johnson as his running mate.  Shrewd as Kennedy's choice seems to be, it is hardly enough to panic Nixon so much that he will lose all hope of winning a single Southern state in November.  Nixon may have been at a loss for words last spring--but he was inarticulate in an attempt to resist all the pressures being applied by his allies, and not because he was confused or indecisive in the face of the relatively minor onslaughts of his opponents.</span></p> <p><span>He has had an easy time of it with his fiscal policy plank.  As Chairman of the President's Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth he achieved an endearing marriage of progressivism and conservatism with the words:  \"We [must] continue to pursue the general policies of the last few years but improve the effectiveness with which we administer these policies.\"  He discovered that formula months ago, but it has taken him several more to adjust his entire platform to the curious slogan, \"positive, progressive conservatism.\"  With as little mention of how local committees are to provide the initiative for financing slum clearance and unemployment relief as the Democrats made of how their program of five per cent growth without taxes is to work, the platform restates a by now very familiar Republican rejection of Federal subsidies and \"artificial\" stimulus of national growth.</span></p> <p><span>President Eisenhower lost his temper over defense last February, and Nixon no doubt feels that it would be unwise to deviate too far from his chief on this touchy subject.  At the same time, he knows that people have little faith in Eisenhower's pleas that they trust his planning when they are about to elect a new President.  Even such a master as Nixon, however, would have a hard time trumpeting \"enough missiles\" and \"more missiles\" in the same speeches.  As a result, he has decided to say nothing except that we have more missiles now than we did under Harry Truman, and if he is elected, we can reasonably expect to get even more.</span></p> <p><span>Nixon's foreign policy plank is even more passive.  What the Vice-President wishes to do--although it is somewhat uncertain what he means by the phrase--is to stand firm, and in doing so to liberate Eastern Europe and Communist South-east Asia.  How he plans to do this--by being rude to the Russians, by being nice to them, or simply by aiming rockets at them whenever they behave badly--he gives no indication.  The entire plank, in fact, when it is not hoping for a glorious future and deploring the recognition of Red China, is celebrating the end of the Korean War and other accomplishments of the Eisenhower Administration.  The Democratic plank also is riddled with irritating platitudes, but is a doctoral dissertion by comparison.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the most interesting thing about this plank is what it has left out.  It has virtually ignored all of Governor Rockefeller's relevant \"points,\" including his remarkable proposal that the U.S. support the \"confederation\" of nations into solid political chunks.  Both Nixon and Charles H. Percy's committee chose to exclude this intriguing scheme from their platform, probably because it seemed a little oddball--perhaps radical--in contrast to the vapidity of the rest of the plank.</span></p> <p><span>Although their reasons for rejection of the Rockefeller plan were likely, I fear, to have been the wrong ones, it is just as well that they did so.  Based on a vague misconstruction of Professor A.A. Berle, the plan was a half-baked, totally uninformed attempt to translate a hope that the European Common Market (and conceivably the Outer Seven Free Trade Area and the new Latin American Common Market also) achieve political unity through economic cooperation.</span></p> <p><span>The convention, however, has staidly satisfied itself with the ponderous pronouncement that the party would approve of political unity in regional groupings, were it to be attained.  By eschewing anything but this tepid conciliatory gesture, Nixon has proved that he would prefer to rest on Eisenhower's laurels (such as they are) rather than on Rockefeller's liberalism.</span></p> <p><span>The Vice-President's search for a platform has ended--but because it had to--and his troubles are by no means over yet.  Every plank is a vacuous patching together of the divergent shreds within the Republican Party, and Nixon has not chosen to reinforce it with something like Al Smith's famous \"wet telegram.\"</span></p> <p><span>I am sure that Nixon would like to be one of the \"vigorous leaders\" that the challenges of the future apparently demand.  It will not be easy, however, to lead such a patchwork kind of unity in any direction.  Senator Goldwater has called the Democratic platform a \"blueprint for socialism,\" but it is hard to conceive of even his wing of the party considering its platform a blueprint for anything but standing still.</span></p> <p><span>Nixon, despite the fact that the convention has undeniably given him command over the Republicans, still has to remember that it was under the President's respectable wing that he flourished for nearly eight years.  If he hopes to conserve the votes of those who know him as Ike's protege, he can hardly afford to take too many potshots at the bird.  With visions of conservative affection for Taft-like politics dancing in his mind, he must ensure that the Old Guard will not find him indistinguishable from his powerful opponents and stay away from the polls.</span></p> <p><span>At the same time, he realizes perfectly well that the increasingly liberal North respects the Rockefeller creed that he carefully omitted from the platform--that the world is changing, and that a new President will have to do something very concrete about it.  The platform approved last night suggests that he will simply play it safe, characterizing the Democrats as too flashy to be responsible, and himself as too sedate to be anything else.</span></p>"}

He's for Kennedy, of course.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the most basic difference between the two candidates, in Schlesinger's view, is that the Massachusetts Senator is concerned with putting across his political program, while the Vice-President is constantly worrying about his own \"image.\"  Schlesinger accuses Nixon of attempting to sell himself.</span></p> <p><span><b>Other-Directed?</b></span></p> <p><span>Nixon, claims Schlesinger, is an \"other-directed\" personality, a \"chameleon\" with no concrete political philosophy of his own.

As examples, Schlesinger cites Nixon's attitudes toward McCarthy, \"eggheads,\" Benson, and \"growthmanship.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy, on the contrary, is portrayed as a man \"of some steadfastness of conviction,\" \"a committed liberal.\"  In a psychoanalytic approach to the democratic nominee's personality, Schlesinger asserts that Kennedy has \"resolved the problem of his own identity,\" and as a result of his long illness has gained a certain measure of inner conviction.\"</span></p> <p><span>Professor Schlesinger is currently on a one-term leave of absence, and a key member in the Kennedy brain trust.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Act One | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The show started off as if someone had switched the scripts, or at least the sourcebooks.  Kennedy quoted Abraham Lincoln, and Nixon invoked the \"Let's take a look at the record\" maxim of Al Smith.  Nixon, who has not built a reputation for this sort of thing, then went on to tell 70 million Americans that his opponent Jack Kennedy was sincere.  So, of course, Nixon added, was Dick Nixon, although Kennedy, to give him credit, never committed himself on this point.</span></p> <p><span>Things had to warm up a bit after all this saccharine, and they did.  Still, Monday's first installment of the \"great debate\" was a remarkably genteel affair.  No one really called anyone a liar (Kennedy came closer, but then, Nixon came closer to lying); Kennedy even accepted without comment or quarrel Nixon's assertion that the two candidates differ not on the goals for America, but only on the means by which to attain them.  There is, after all, a point at which a difference on means becomes in effect a difference on ends.</span></p> <p><span>For example, on David Susskind's <i>Open End</i> program last month, Governor Mark Hatfield of Oregon expounded the same ends-means line, saying that the difference between the parties was that to solve the same problems, the Democrats relied too much on government action while the Republicans preferred to exhaust private means before turning to the government.  Paul Ziffren, California's former Democratic National Committeeman, asked, \"How many old people have to go without adequate medical care before the Republicans think it's time for government action?  How many children must go to school on double session before the Republicans think the Federal government ought to act?  How depressed must a depressed area be before private means of relief are considered exhausted?\"  There were several more in a series of these questions, and to all of them Hatfield's reply was something like, \"Well, I'm glad you asked that question, because it's a very good question, and I'd like to answer that question, and I wish I could.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nixon does not fluster quite that easily, although his performance Monday night may leave some doubts in that regard, but he gave Kennedy the same kind of opening that Hatfield gave Ziffren, and Kennedy did not respond.  It must be assumed that Kennedy passed up this and other opportunities by choice and not by incapacity.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, one of the most interesting features of Monday night's episode was the inhibitions both men seemed to feel; both Nixon and Kennedy have been known to exhibit an \"instinct for the jugular\" in dealings with their party colleagues, yet neither was willing even to try to finish off his man before 70 million television viewers.  Although a little ruthlessness may well be what the Presidency needs (and although both candidates have in the past displayed adequate supplies of this rather debatable virtue), ruthlessness does not sell well on television, so Kennedy and Nixon have thus far avoided any stunning attack or counter-attack that might in some way inspire public sympathy for the victim.</span></p> <p><span>So the debate was tame, but it was still, as both candidates remarked, \"useful.\"  Face-to-face confrontation is much more revealing than arguments carried out days and thousands of miles apart; it also disposes of some of the more obvious distortions.  For example, although in his day-to-day campaigning Nixon continues to make much of Kennedy's alleged \"I would have apologized to Khrushchev\" remark, he didn't dare bring it up with Kennedy on the same stage ready to place it in its proper context.</span></p> <p><span>Similarly, each man got burned Monday night when he strayed a bit from the facts in fields where his opponent was well-briefed:  Kennedy was caught using a recession year to prove the United States' low rate of economic growth; Nixon was caught, perhaps more significantly, misrepresenting the provisions of bills on Federal aid to education and medical care for the aged.</span></p> <p><span>Although not so sharp is the Hatfield-Ziffren exchange, the debate made clear to those who were looking closely that there is some difference in basic attitudes between the candidates and between the parties.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy put on a good performance, and he may finally have converted the recalcitrant Stevensonians, a large group (particularly in the key states of New York and California) that wasn't planning to vote for Nixon but was seriously considering not voting at all.  Nixon, on the other hand, probably did best with those already firmly in his camp; he was most effective in discussing fiscal responsibility and the higher taxes he thinks the Democratic program would require.</span></p> <p><span>The jury, however, is still very much out on the 1960 election, and it will take more than one kid-gloves debate to sway the large group of undecided voters.  Nixon, in particular, will have to do better in the succeeding episodes.</span></p> <p><span>And for the next installment, a few irreverent words of advice:  Mr. Nixon, you do not look earnest on camera when Mr. Kennedy is speaking; you look positively malevolent; do something about your face.  Mr. Kennedy, this \"half-slave, half-free\" bit is tired; find a new lead.  Mr. Nixon, anyone who knows the President's news conferences would know that he was not being facetious when he said that if he were given a week, he might think of a major idea you had proposed; he was merely having his usual troubles with the English language; of course, that's rather difficult to explain to 70 million people.</span></p>"}

It will demand that the President place himself in the very thick of the fight, that he care passionately about the fate of the people he leads, that he be willing to serve them at the risk of incurring their momentary displeasure.</span></p> <p><span>It is significant that in the press reports of Kennedy's appearance before the National Press Club, most papers gave the speech only secondary coverage, emphasizing instead either the Senator's oblique reference to his possible entry in the California primary or the question of his withdrawal--upon request of church groups--from a Philadelphia speaking engagement in 1950.  This second issue, peripheral even to the peripheral question of Kennedy's Catholicism, is typical of the inane matters that enliven American political campaigns.  Only the New York Times devoted much attention to Kennedy's address, which was--as James Reston wrote--the \"first really serious political speech of the formal campaign.\"</span></p> <p><span>Admittedly, Kennedy has not yet spoken out in specific terms on the \"increasingly dangerous, unsolved, long-postponed problems\" that lie \"beneath today's surface gloss of peace and prosperity.\"  But seven years of an Eisenhower Presidency have made the office itself and way it is executed an issue of importance.  Kennedy's pledge of a vigorous Presidency is a welcome and promising start for his campaign.  If he can continue to discuss the issues on a realistic and intelligent basis, he may be able to keep the 1960 race from the usual level of slogans and petty side issues.  Cassandra may not bear glad tidings, but she is a good deal more truthful than Pollyanna.</span></p>"}

Kennedy's latest speech, which could certainly be classed as a \"ringing manifesto from the rear of the battle.\" On the other hand, when there was actually something to be done, as in the question of a labor reform bill, Kennedy, in going back on the major principles and powers of his bill, hardly displayed great willingness \"to serve them at the risk of incurring their monetary displeasure.\" It was representatives Landrum and Griffin, and those who voted for their bill despite the pressure of the unions, who showed this willingness.</span></p> <p><span>The CRIMSON has put its finger on a national problem in remarking on the quality of presidential campaigns. If the people are best moved to vote for a candidate by a combination of pandering to local desires and motivational research, it is because that is what they want. The President is supposed to represent the will of the people; to ensure a President who is a statesman, we must have an electorate which is interested in and can recognize statesmanship. The fault lies with the people, not with the candidates; the people get what they desire and deserve. In the meantime we can only hope that the men elected by \"polite name-calling and Madison Avenue sloganeering\" will also display statesmanship. Senator Kennedy has displayed a great ability at keeping his name in the papers; but he has not, as his flyer on the Algerian problem demonstrates, displayed ability to do anything beyond saying things; contrast Vice President Nixon's record of effectiveness.</span></p> <p><span>To quote Pohl and Kornbluth's Presidential Year, a penetrating account of the realities of national politics in novel form:</span></p> <p><span>\"That was what it had come down to.

There can be no question but that more public debate of the significant issues which today confront the nation would be a healthy phenomenon at the leading institution of higher education....</span></p> <p><span>Mr. Chase, whose most recent dabbling in political theory has left him with nothing more concrete than a vaguely, and I suspect, instinctively anti-democratic bias, might do well to read some of the writings of Mr. Malcolm Moos, of late Mr. Eisenhower's chief political speechwriter.  For Mr. Moos, far from being a defender of the public interest, is rather a passionate advocate of government by interest group (and, one suspects, the bigger the interest, the more of the government it should run).  If we were to compare Mr. Moos's views with those of another political scientist, say, Professor James McGregor Burns of Williams, whose book, <b>Congress on Trial</b> I would recommend to Mr. Chase, we would find a startling contrast in their respective theories of the public interest.</span></p> <p><span>And to whom does Mr. Burns serve as advisor?  Why, none other than the very same Senator Kennedy whom Mr. Chase so vehemently berates.  Might we not query Mr. Chase as to how he accounts for Senator Kennedy's vote in favor of the St. Lawrence Seaway. . . .  Or let us consider the Senator's prophetic call for Algerian self-determination--to whose selfish interests was he pandering then, all those \"piggish, self-centered\" Algerian voters in Boston? . . .  Not to mention the Senator's courageous stand on the National Defense Education Act's inexcusable loyalty oath and affidavit provisions--undoubtedly brought about by pressure from \"Boss Pusey.\"</span></p> <p><span>No, Mr. Chase, if you are so earnest an advocate of the liberal concept of the public interest, you are a member of the wrong political party.  Nonetheless, I am bound to say that the Republican Party is fortunate in having so able an apologist.

With cheery estimates from the Bureau of the Budget and the Department of the Treasury, Mr. Eisenhower predicted a $4.2 billion surplus--one largely dependent upon $1 billion in increased taxation and continued economic advance.</span></p> <p><span>The message only superficially answered two disturbing questions.  A reduction in the national debt, made possible by the surplus, would ease credit and expand national production--thus attempting to counter questions about the desirability of a surplus.

With these two rather vague underpinnings, Mr. Eisenhower proudly proclaimed that Prosperity would continue.</span></p> <p><span>With the other parts of the Trinity, Peace and Progress, the budget message failed to advance any constructve ideas.  Instead of strengthening American military power in the face of the \"missile gap,\" the President shortsightedly favored a cut in military expenditures, moving back even more the hope of \"balanced\" forces capable to fight all types of wars.  Instead of proposing to use the budget surplus for school or highway construction, debt reduction must come first.</span></p> <p><span>Vague promises about economic welfare cannot substitute for an imaginative use of a budget surplus.

A Civil Rights Commission plan to assign Federal Registrars to voting districts which practice discrimination in registering Negroes has been called constitutional by Professor Freund of the Law School and Texas Law School Professor Charles Alan Wright, thus countering the doubts President Eisenhower recently expressed as to its legality.
