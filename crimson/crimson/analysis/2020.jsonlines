{"title": "The Double-Edged Sword of Social Justice | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>There are two types of social justice. The first one is real, palpable, peaceful change instituted for the benefit of marginalized groups and causes. Therein we find #MeToo, Black Lives Matter, BGLTQ rights, Kaepernick kneeling for the anthem to protest police brutality, Greta Thunberg raising climate change awareness, and so on. The other type is nefarious. It is self-serving and, ironically, unjust. It keeps us from transcending the very barriers that proponents of social justice aspire to overcome. And it manifests in many forms.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s when people bully and ostracize others under the guise of protecting minority groups. It\u2019s when people actively look for ways to misconstrue a person\u2019s words or actions, demean them, galvanize the masses, and hence promote their own interests (attention, retweets, etc.). It\u2019s when people create a rhetorical peanut gallery of frivolous dialogue while clandestine, truly harmful policies pass with little scrutiny. It\u2019s one of mob mentality. Here at Harvard, we see this latter form as much as the former. And if we are committed to equal rights, we need to change that.</span></p> <p><span>A prime example is last year\u2019s decision not to renew Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. as a faculty dean. Students actively rallied, demonized him, and <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/12/students-protest-sullivan-weinstein/\">demanded</a> that Harvard fire him. Why? All Sullivan did was get hired to defend someone in a court of law. This country is founded upon certain prescribed freedoms \u2014 one is the right to a lawyer, as well as a fair trial. Nothing like this happened when Harvard Law School\u2019s Professor Emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz represented O.J. Simpson, accused of double murder, in his trial, nor when he was recently hired to represent Donald Trump in his impeachment. Yet when Sullivan represented Harvey Weinstein, social justice advocates promulgated a double standard, going mad over his decision. Moreover, John Adams himself, a chief intellectual behind the founding of the United States, set a bold precedent in representing British troops after the Boston Massacre. It was an enlightened one, as it ensured the protection of individuals in all cases \u2014 publicly perceived to be guilty or not. We can\u2019t suddenly abandon these ideals of benevolence and equal rights; it is contrary to the intent of social justice.</span></p> <p><span>A more widespread form of fake social justice \u2014 on- and off-campus \u2014 is the culture of political correctness. PC culture is something that must be done away with. It hinders free speech, conjures controversy out of things that shouldn\u2019t be controversial (e.g., most comedy), and stifles people from challenging one another when they subject themselves to perpetual \u201csafe spaces.\u201d Holocaust deniers are, even as absurd as their beliefs prove, protected with free speech and a right to assemble. But when a comedian makes a petty joke, people often look to take offense to it so they can try to \u201ccancel\u201d that comedian\u2019s career. A recent example of cancel culture in the Harvard area is when conservative commentator and writer Ben Shapiro gave a speech at Boston University. Protestors met this with vengeance; they tried to \u201ccancel\u201d it, just because they disagreed with him. I\u2019m no fan of Shapiro, but I can\u2019t stop him simply because he \u201coffends\u201d me. Legally, I can protest his free speech, but that doesn\u2019t mean I should; he spreads his message peacefully, with ostensibly benevolent intentions.</span></p> <p><span>Granted, if someone is making threats or causing harm, it totally makes sense why one would want to address such a problem to protect powerless or otherwise marginalized people. But, in general, we can\u2019t simply bully people with whom we disagree; sometimes, they just haven\u2019t been properly exposed to enough culture and education to rid themselves of stereotypes. Attacking people won\u2019t change their minds. What can change people is empathy, shared experience, and demonstration that we\u2019re more alike than we think.</span></p> <p><span>When someone is being racist, sexist, homophobic, or xenophobic, don\u2019t meet it with hate. That\u2019s just reciprocal prejudice. Meet them with an open heart; show why you disagree with their views in a constructive way. Show that we\u2019re all human \u2014 with the same fears, joys, frustrations, tastes, and hobbies. We even have the same memes. It may not work, but you\u2019ll serve society more than you would by meeting ignorance with organized hate or ostracization. If you hear students\u2019 classroom discussions here at Harvard, see what\u2019s on social media, or notice campus rhetoric, you will see that there is a degree of intolerance for conservatives, Christians, Republicans, and others of minority political and religious stances. This is antithetical to liberalism and multiculturalism, which are all-inclusive concepts. I dream of a world wherein everyone has the same platforms and privileges to express themselves and live in a truly egalitarian world.  To quote Evelyn B. Hall\u2019s <a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/06/01/defend-say/\">summary of Voltaire</a>: \u201cI disagree with what you say but will defend to the death your right to say it.\u201d So don\u2019t be judgmental, quick to conclusions, or hateful. Be respectful, empathetic, open to interpretation, and constructive.</span></p> <p><span><em>Luke T. Atkins is in his second year at the Harvard Extension School.</em></span></p>"}
{"title": "A Culture of Fear | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "The Crimson Editorial Board", "body": "<p><span>Last fall, Reihana Emami Arandi, a recent admittee of Harvard Divinity School\u2019s Master of Theological Studies program, was <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/3/lawyers-file-arandi-case/\">deported</a> from Boston Logan International Airport to her home country of Iran. Despite going through the long, tedious process of attaining a student visa, Arandi\u2019s visa was revoked shortly after landing by Custom and Border Patrol officials, citing \u201cimmigrant intent.\u201d She was issued an expedited removal order followed by an additional five-year ban from the United States.</span></p> <p><span>This event is part of a recent trend of Iranian students with valid student visas being denied entry into the country. Just last month, Iranian student <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/us/iranian-students-deported.html\">Shahab Dehghani</a> was deported shortly after arriving at Logan Airport with a valid student visa. And there have been at least 13 cases since August of Iranian students being deported across the U.S. despite having valid student visas. While we acknowledge that we do not know the complete facts of this specific case at the moment, the increasing prevalence of such cases reflects a troubling pattern.</span></p> <p><span>The impact of these deportations extends far beyond the individuals concerned. Each builds upon a climate of paranoia and fear for immigrants. The onslaught of these deportations, along with the Trump administration\u2019s insistence on weaponized, anti-immigrant rhetoric and a deeply offensive travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries, nurture hostility toward immigrants in this country. We strongly condemn the Trump administration\u2019s dangerous rhetoric and policies that have led to incidents such as Arandi\u2019s. It is of the utmost importance that the U.S. \u2014 and particularly institutions of higher education \u2014 fully embrace and support immigrants in the name of secure, open cultural exchange.</span></p> <p><span>We find these cases particularly concerning in light of the extensive background checks and increased screening of visa applicants carried out by U.S. immigration authorities. While the process of obtaining a student visa is arduous, applicants from the countries targeted by the original travel ban \u2014 including Iran \u2014 face even more stringent vetting and longer processing times. Moreover, according to a new State Department rule introduced last year, visa applicants from most countries are now required to disclose additional information, including social media profiles. For students with valid visas to be turned away at the airport after facing such comprehensive and invasive scrutiny seems inexplicable without the anti-immigrant program emanating from the White House.</span></p> <p><span>It is important to note that these immigration policies have been met with strong opposition from Harvard\u2019s administration. After an incoming Harvard freshman was denied entry into the U.S. and subsequently deported, the University worked with immigration authorities to resolve the issue, resulting in the student\u2019s eventual arrival on campus.</span></p> <p><span>We are grateful that Harvard has the institutional influence to support its international students and lobby for their immigration rights. Resources such as the Harvard International Office\u2019s 24/7 emergency hotline for international students and scholars facing issues while attempting to enter the U.S. are crucial in helping protect the ability of international students to participate in the production of scholarship on campus.</span></p> <p><span>President Bacow, who has written to administration officials and lawmakers with concerns about immigration policies, has been vocal in criticizing the unnecessary disruption, delays, and anxiety faced by international students during the immigration process. We <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/9/9/editorial-uncertain-immigration-policy/\">commend</a> his work in advocating for those affected by these policies, and urge him to continue that work \u2014 even more aggressively \u2014 to advocate for students with immigration issues beyond just in the cases of those accepted to Harvard.</span></p> <p><span><em>This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board.

Students will advocate for legislative change, work on impact litigation, and assist BGLTQ clients \u2014 particularly underrepresented groups and individuals \u2014 in need of legal services.</span></p> <p><span>Four students will help staff the clinic this semester, according to its founding director, Alexander L.

Kurilla", "body": "<p><span>Harvard Law School professor Alan M. Dershowitz\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/1/17/dershowitz-trump-impeachment-team/\">defense</a> of President Donald J. Trump in the impeachment trial has sparked mixed reactions from legal experts across the country.</span></p> <p><span>Launching his opening statement on the Senate floor Sunday night by declaring his \u201clove\u201d for the United States, Dershowitz \u2013 a renowned criminal defense lawyer \u2014 proceeded to argue that impeachment on the grounds of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress was \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI will argue that our constitution and its terms high crimes and misdemeanors do not encompass the two articles, charging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress,\u201d Dershowitz said.</span></p> <p><span>Dershowitz has <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/1/26/dershowitz-on-trump/\">vocally defended</a> Trump throughout his presidency, taking to media outlets to support the president and some of his policies.</span></p> <p><span>Legal experts from across the country met Dershowitz\u2019s opening statements with a flurry of praise and criticism.</span></p> <p><span>Michael J. Gerhardt, a constitutional law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said Dershowitz was \u201cdead wrong\u201d in his argument. In December, Gerhardt testified in front of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee as part of a four-person panel discussing the constitutional grounds of impeachment.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe central point he\u2019s really sending out is that a President can abuse his power all the time. There\u2019s no constitutional check on that,\u201d Gerhardt said. The argument that abuse of power, standing alone, is not an impeachable offense and therefore may not be accountable to Congress is \u201cjust startling,\u201d according to Gerdhardt.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHis defense fits neatly in the President\u2019s efforts and the President\u2019s lawyer\u2019s efforts to misdirect people\u2019s attention, essentially trying to confuse people and distract people by misstatement,\u201d Gerhardt added.</span></p> <p><span>Nikolas Bowie, an assistant professor at the Law School, opined in the New York Times that he recognized the argument Dershowitz used in Trump\u2019s defense but disagreed with the assessment that the president did not commit any crimes.</span></p> <p><span>In his opening statement, Dershowitz referenced Bowie\u2019s previous arguments regarding impeachment. Bowie wrote a December 2018 article in the Harvard Law Review titled \u201cHigh Crimes Without Law\u201d that crimes must occur for an impeachment to take place.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWatching CNN last week, I learned that I\u2019m partly responsible for President Trump\u2019s legal defense,\u201d Bowie wrote in his opinion piece. \u201cAs an academic, my first reaction was to be grateful that someone had actually read one of my articles. But as a legal academic, my second reaction was confusion. Even if you think impeachment requires a crime, as I do, that belief hardly supports the president\u2019s defense or Mr. Dershowitz\u2019s position.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>George Washington University Professor Jonathan Turley offered a defense of Dereshowitz\u2019s opening statements in a piece published to his personal website.</span></p> <p><span>Turley \u2014 who testified in front of the House Judiciary Committee and did not recommend impeachment \u2014 wrote on his website that he thought Dershowitz\u2019s presentation was \u201coutstanding,\u201d though he disagreed with some aspects of Dershowitz\u2019s theory.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAlan Dershowitz is hardly someone in need of the defense of others. However, there is a disturbing level of acrimony and personal attacks directed at the retired Harvard professor after he agreed to speak in defense of President Donald Trump,\u201d Turley wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Turley wrote that he is concerned about the commentary surrounding Dershowitz, particularly attacks on his character. He noted that other professors at the Law School did not receive the same criticism for taking high profile cases.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cCommentators attack him for taking famous, high-profile cases and portray him as only motivated by the press,\u201d Turley wrote. \u201cThey do not make the same objections to liberal professors and commentators who routinely take such cases and make media appearances from Laurence Tribe to Neil Katyal to Noah Feldman.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey agree with their opinions so their motivations are not questioned,\u201d he added. \u201cThe fact is that none of their motivations should be questioned. They are all insightful and influential thinkers.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Law School Lecturer Nancy Gertner denounced Dershowitz\u2019s defense of Trump in a piece she wrote for WBUR\u2019s Cognoscenti blog.</span></p> <p><span>In her blog post, she wrote that Dershowitz used to be an \u201cicon for civil libertarians,\u201d but his support for the president compromised that distinction.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was not remotely the position of a civil libertarian to claim that a president is more powerful than a king,\u201d Gertner wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Gertner wrote in her post that no one should combine Dershowitz\u2019s views with the dangerous positions of his client and said Dershowitz rejected bipartisan consensus of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress as impeachable offenses.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBy the end of his presentation on Monday, he was in full-throated defense of the White House on all fronts, summing up his version of the facts, no fancy civil libertarian disclaimer there,\u201d Gertner wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Dershowitz did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Michelle G.

{"title": "College Democrats Continue Canvassing Votes in Lead-up to Election Day | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Jessica Lee", "body": "<p><span>The Harvard College Democrats have adapted their campaign strategies to pandemic conditions, replacing door-to-door canvassing with phone banking competitions and virtual events as they seek to reach voters before the upcoming election.</span></p> <p><span>According to College Democrats Vice President Oswaldo A. Ambrosio \u201922, a principal goal for the organization is to promote political participation during this election cycle. Ambrosio emphasized the importance of encouraging eligible voters to vote.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThese changes are going to affect us, and if we don\u2019t have our voices heard, then the people that are in power are not going to do the things that we actually think are necessary to make progress in this country, and to have a real inclusive vision of what America can be,\u201d Ambrosio said.</span></p> <p><span>This year, the group has sponsored the Harvard for Biden subgroup of the organization and campaigned for Democratic candidates up and down the ballot.</span></p> <p><span>In past election cycles, the club has held canvassing trips, during which volunteers participated in door-to-door campaigning and spoke with voters. Now, the College Democrats have focused most of their canvassing efforts on phone banking.</span></p> <p><span>During each phone banking event, around 10 to 30 volunteers call voters to relay details about candidates and advocate for legislative issues. In the past week, volunteers have called voters about ballot questions in various states, including voting \"yes\" for ranked choice voting in Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span>According to College Democrats President Menatallah N. Bahnasy \u201922, the club has made roughly 3500 calls this past semester. The group hopes to make another 1500 calls between Friday and Election Day on Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span>The Democrats have also partnered with other universities to host phone banking competitions. Most recently, all eight Ivy League universities participated in a phone banking competition for candidates in Florida.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s not just Harvard students that will be affected by the things that these candidates will pursue. In the future, everybody is affected,\u201d Ambrosio said. \u201cBeing able to see other people phone bank alongside with you, or at different schools, just reminds you that we\u2019re really all in this together.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bahnasy noted the importance of participation during elections that could be determined by a few hundred votes. She added that it is every individual\u2019s \u201ccivic duty\u201d to vote, especially given historical fights for that right.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYour voice matters no matter how small you might think it is. I think there\u2019s a great sentiment that one vote won\u2019t make a difference, or \u2018I don\u2019t have to vote because it\u2019s not going to matter in the long run,\u2019\u201d Bahnasy said. \u201cBut that\u2019s far from the truth. Every vote matters.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>According to Ambrosio, political involvement encompasses much more than just voting for the Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>The group\u2019s broader efforts have included writing letters to state legislatures advocating for sexual assault justice system reform and phone banking for issues like immigration and climate change. Over the summer, the group held a phone bank for Black Lives Matter.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEverybody\u2019s vote matters, but also I think voting is just the start of anything. Voting is not the only thing that is necessary to build political power and make sure that our elected officials actually hear what we\u2019re saying,\u201d Ambrosio said. \u201cWe have to contest every part of the political arena.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard Republican Club, which <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/30/harvard-republicans-endorse-trump/\">endorsed</a> incumbent President Donald J.

The opening shot sets the scene with a placard that says \u201cMotel\u201d on a bedside table, then fades to the title card: written in a biblically gothic font, transposed over the figure of Jesus Christ on a motel crucifix.

Seriously, he\u2019s SO greasy: The video\u2019s budget seems to have been redirected from narrative planning to the obscene amount of oil they smear on JB\u2019s face to show that he really is just like your average fracker.</span></p> <p><span>At this point, we\u2019re given a glimpse of the warm, kindhearted nature of JB\u2019s fictional paramour, who is caring for the elderly in a nursing home. It\u2019s important to note that nobody at said nursing home is remotely taking coronavirus precautions. Instead, they are just playing Bingo and vibing \u2014 raising the question of whether this is a pre-COVID timepiece, a modern sans-COVID AU, or just an anti-mask propaganda piece.</span></p> <p><span>This question becomes all the more ambiguous when JB\u2019s foreman delivers the news that they are shutting down the plant due to the \u201ccurrent and ongoing global situation.\u201d What other \u201cglobal situation\u201d could they be referring to besides the pandemic? Climate change, possibly? The ruination of God\u2019s green Earth, spurred on by the very oil that JB was extracting only moments before? Or, more hopefully, is it a shift away from fossil fuels, potentially placing the JB \u201cHoly\u201d timeline in a universe after the upcoming election where Joe Biden wins and uses his influence to push for green energy?</span></p> <p><span>We get no answers. The only conclusion is that the Justin Bieber \u201cHoly\u201d video is just a love letter to Exxon. Seriously, this reeks of Big Oil money. Is BP using this video to distract from their latest spill or something?</span></p> <p><span>Don\u2019t fret, because there\u2019s more meat to this strange, holy-water-induced fever dream. As Chance the Rapper\u2019s verse begins, he paces around a greenhouse full of dead plants, with Bieber sulking around behind him (perhaps another reference to the destruction of God\u2019s boundless majesty?). The video then returns to the motel, where an overall-clad \u2014 and still super greasy \u2014 Bieber delivers the news to his partner that the plant is closing. His partner\u2019s income from the nursing home is not enough to support the pair and they are evicted from their motel room \u2014 potentially a reference to the subpar treatment of healthcare workers in America? Interesting.</span></p> <p><span>As Bieber\u2019s oil worker caricature and his partner face homelessness, the problem at the heart of this portion of the video becomes obvious. Bieber\u2019s essentially cosplaying poverty, egregiously misrepresenting and romanticizing its realities. It\u2019s disheartening to see a global popstar with a huge platform, and exorbitant amounts of wealth, dress up in dirty clothes to play a homeless oil worker without actually providing any substantive commentary on poverty in America.</span></p> <p><span>The pair continues to wander through town, down on their luck until a car pulls up beside them. And who is behind the wheel? Wilmer Valderrama, of all people, dressed in military fatigues. Valderrama shows them kindness and grace by inviting them home for \u201ca warm meal.\u201d Before you know it, they\u2019re all headed to Valderrama\u2019s house where it is revealed, through a tearful embrace with his family, that Valderrama\u2019s army character has just returned from his deployment. That\u2019s right, when Valderrama\u2019s children first see their father after his service tour, he is accompanied by a (still greasy) Bieber and his (not Hailey) partner, both total strangers.</span></p> <p><span>Charmingly, the family and the fictional Biebers enjoy the meal together. As they say grace and dine together, the final chorus rises and the video ends with a Hallmark-esque montage of the group laughing and eating, interspersed with flashbacks to Bieber\u2019s oil drilling days. Heartwarming \u2014 like climate change for the soul.</span></p> <p><span>Or at least it would be, if the video wasn\u2019t so wildly random, utterly chaotic, and mildly offensive.</span></p> <p><span>The song does kind of slap, though.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Joseph P.

Tyler-Dudley \u201921 and his blockmates are spending the semester. In between school work and extracurriculars, the group spends any free moment available participating in campaign and voter registration phone banks.</span></p> <p><span>Immersed in this ever-present political scenery, most of them will be casting their ballots this fall in a swing state. Tyler-Dudley has observed \u201ca lot of distrust\u201d in both government and institutions more broadly.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that no matter what way [the election] goes we're going to see a huge degree of skepticism towards the results of that election, which is very concerning to me as I think people's faith in the electoral process has been undermined,\u201d Tyler-Dudley added, with the tone of a veteran diplomat. \u201cAnd I think that's going to see very serious impacts on people's belief in the power of democracy in the United States.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Tyler-Dudley\u2019s personal experiences confirm a sentiment that, from my liberal haven in Cambridge, I\u2019ve been feeling too: The fall of democracy is upon us.</span></p> <p><span>Right now, we\u2019re witnessing the erosion of trust in government, civic and human rights, and the shared premises that <a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries/sapiens\">enable</a> our collaboration and survival. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/end-of-democracy-election/2020/10/25/3b8c0940-13d0-11eb-ba42-ec6a580836ed_story.html\">Regardless of who you are</a> and who you plan to vote for, the stakes in this election feel excruciatingly high.</span></p> <p><span>Kate A. Gundersen \u201923, who writes for the Harvard Political Review, painted a similarly bleak picture in an email: \u201cI fear that the biggest threat to democracy is the constant manipulation of information, the dissemination of misinformation, and the President's attacks on the \u2018Fake News.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Christopher Ong \u201922 who applied to be a poll worker in Las Vegas after learning there was a shortage, expressed concern over lawsuits aiming to restrict access to the polls and make it easier for mail-in ballots to be rejected, disproportionately affecting Black Americans.</span></p> <p><span>Democracy has, of course, progressed in the past two hundred years through the extension of voting rights to citizens other than white men. Still, the ability to vote does not amount to democracy as such, even if we often grant it that power in our political discourse. The systems that make each vote count are equally important.</span></p> <p><span>I like so many other Americans see one particular outcome as unacceptable. If President Donald J. Trump wins this fall, it will be a sure sign of the further deterioration of American democracy. Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/trump-impeached.html\">impeachment</a> but non-conviction, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/26/portland-oregon-protests-what-is-happening-trump-chicago-albuquerque\">performance</a> of law and order through his deployment of federal agents to quell protests, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/25/politics/election-2020-electoral-fraud-donald-trump-joe-biden/index.html\">refusal</a> to assure a peaceful transition of power, and insistence on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/26/us/trump-biden-election#amy-coney-barrett-is-set-to-be-confirmed-to-the-supreme-court-today-capping-a-breakneck-process\">confirming</a> a supreme court justice eight days before the election are only a few reasons why.</span></p> <p><span>Although a Biden-Harris victory would bring a spring burgeoning with new possibilities and cause for optimism, to say a Biden presidency would be proof of \u201cdemocracy\u201d would be a deceptive exaggeration.</span></p> <p><span>The many failures of democracy throughout the Trump presidency aren\u2019t the failures of one man, but intended outcomes of the American political system's design. America has always been far from achieving the true ideal of democracy. Systemic roadblocks include: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/what-is-gerrymandering.html\">gerrymandering</a>, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/timeline-voter-suppression-us-civil-war-today/story?id=72248473\">voter suppression</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights.aspx\">inconsistent voting rights </a>for the incarcerated, <a href=\"https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/campaign-finance-reform\">corrupt campaign financing policies</a>, and an electoral college system that led to the majority of voters in 2016 not having their choice become President.</span></p> <p><span>But the fall of democracy takes on another meaning. This autumn, we\u2019re digging in \u2014 across a divided nation, outside our bubble, we\u2019re staging important fights. Civic duty and political participation are being taken up with unmatched energy, passion, and creativity. Dispersed across the globe, Harvard students have gained a more nuanced picture of the American politics and its varied stakes \u2014 from the Pocono Mountains to Vegas Strip.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe tend to forget that Harvard is a bubble, a little progressive bubble,\u201d Blake Barclay \u201822 said, calling me from Florida. He\u2019s chair of the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Harvard Institute of Politics, which gives him a particularly piercing view of this bubble.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhere I live, Trump is exceedingly popular still,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vast majority of people are voting for Trump, which is a far cry from when I was in Cambridge and New York where I'm not sure I could find a Trump supporter if I tried.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, the Harvard bubble has burst. We\u2019re living at the borders of America\u2019s deepest divisions. However, as we watch democracy decay so clearly before our eyes, we\u2019re coalescing around a shared democratic spirit.</span></p> <p><span>Menat N. Bahnasy '22, president of the Harvard College Democrats, noted the new possibilities for political activism opened by the societal ruptures caused by COVID-19. \u201cWhat's truly amazing about this virtual and digital era is the opportunity that it has given us to engage in democracy in even more ways than in-person,\u201d she wrote in an email.</span></p> <p><span>Likewise, Kevin L. Ballen \u201922 and Amanda R. Powers \u201921, co-chairs of the Harvard Votes Challenge, are heartened by the democratic processes surging across the nation. \u201cWe have already seen record numbers of people voting by mail and early at the polls,\u201d they shared in a joint statement. \u201cOn our own campus, we have seen success in that thousands of students have made a plan to vote with us. With this record turnout, we hope to see elected leaders that reflect young people's hopes and desires.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>My friend Fariba Mahmud \u201922 recently published an<a href=\"https://medium.com/@fariba.mahmud/100-reasons-to-not-re-elect-president-trump-601ee5a6103f\"> ongoing list</a> of reasons not to re-elect Trump that she has been curating for the past four years. \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers stamp my social media feed. Months after the murder of George Floyd, Black Lives Matter protests and the fight for justice continue.</span></p> <p><span>Though we\u2019re feeling it acutely now, every fall is a fall of democracy. As we gear up for the election, democracy seems to be collapsing in on itself; disagreement tests us; atrocities come into focus. And every year we have to come together to hold it up. Such is the great paradox of democracy \u2014 that it\u2019s always by nature vulnerable, that its integrity relies on its fragility.</span></p> <p><span>I have faith in democracy because I have faith in my generation. We have learned, early on in our lives, that democracy is never achieved. Democracy must be continually worked for \u2014 and it can only be worked for together.</span></p> <p><span><em>Aysha L.J.

When we met for the last time before quarantine, I ordered for him; he paid.</span></p> <p><span>He is a Vietnam war veteran, softball coach, and real estate agent. He is eccentric and old enough to be my grandfather but not loopy \u2014 his eyes are limpid and alert, and he remembers the minutiae of our conversations, from my summer plans to my roommates\u2019 classes. He is my only friend above age 60, and he has political beliefs I profoundly disagree with. And yet I have lost sleep over the possibility that he might contract coronavirus.</span></p> <p><span>All of my columns so far have focused on strangers who remained strangers, people whom I would likely not recognize should I run into them again. This week, I want to write about a stranger who became a friend.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps all of our friends are originally strangers, but many are known to us in some way before they become our friends: They are our classmates, colleagues, teammates, or friends of friends; we start with an outline of our connection to them and arrive at friendship by shading in particulars.</span></p> <p><span>I am speaking of a different sort of friendship, one that emerged from chance repeated encounters. I met the man whose coffee order I now have memorized because he was a substitute teacher at my high school. That we were in the same place at the same point in time \u2014 a high school classroom on a Friday afternoon \u2014 was entirely incidental: He happened to be assigned to that room on the day I was supposed to be learning something in it.</span></p> <p><span>He substituted regularly; we saw each other maybe once a month, every month, all four years of high school. During my senior year, I found his birthday through the school registrar and gave him home-baked blueberry crumble. He was one of the first people to congratulate me on my acceptance to Harvard. He called me \u201cCrimson,\u201d and when he suggested that we meet in Harvard Square when I was officially a college student, I did him one better and said that we should make it a regular occasion.</span></p> <p><span>When we meet, he talks about his grandchildren and I talk about school. Sometimes we talk about politics. We both dislike President Donald Trump but for very different reasons, and our shared political inclinations do not extend very far beyond that. He reminds me to care about things I know are important but rarely remember the plight of veterans, social security, and deteriorating infrastructure.</span></p> <p><span>These are issues I associate with a different generation, and I don\u2019t think about them often because I don\u2019t have any other friends who are, to put it colloquially, boomers. In fact, I know very few Harvard students who have friends that are significantly older than they are. Aside from the oldsters we are required to interact with \u2014 relatives, professors, and professional colleagues \u2014 our social networks are wholly homogeneous with respect to age.</span></p> <p><span>This is not surprising; we are not afforded many opportunities to befriend older people. But the politics of the age gap are increasingly sharp. Although older people have long leaned conservative, the last two decades have shown a wider political chasm emerging around age. In the 2018 midterms, Gen Z and young Millenials \u2014 people under 30 \u2014 favored Democrats by two to one, compared to an even Democrat-Republican split in voters over 65.</span></p> <p><span>Myriad factors feed into this age gap. More and more older people silo themselves ideologically in social media echo chambers; they represent the fastest growing social media user demographic. Norms and language matter, too; growing up with same-sex couples on TV and a vocabulary that included \u201cintersectionality\u201d and \u201cinstitutionalized racism\u201d gave my generation a vastly different starting point.</span></p> <p><span>I should also emphasize that I do not refer to either \u201cmy generation\u201d or \u201colder people\u201d as monolithic political entities: Many boomers were leaders in the anti-war, civil rights, and women\u2019s liberation movements; gender, race, geography, and class all muddy any universalizing age-based political assumptions.</span></p> <p><span>But on some issues, the age difference in politics is undeniable and clearcut: Roughly half of people older than 55 worry about global warming, compared to 70 percent of 18 to 34-year-olds. Older white Americans are far less likely to express support for the Black Lives Matter movement compared to younger Americans.</span></p> <p><span>Like many members of my generation, I feel an intense but nebulous resentment toward older people for bequeathing a figuratively and literally burning planet. My friendship with an older person cannot dampen that existential ire.</span></p> <p><span>But I write this piece on the precipice of a brutal pandemic winter, in which tens if not hundreds of thousands of older Americans are expected to die. If we remain socially disconnected from the elderly, we are destined to view these deaths not as tragedies but as statistics \u2014 or worse, a perverse good riddance, a necessary separation of chaff that allows for political progress.</span></p> <p><span>I do not know how my friend will vote. But our cross-generational, unexpected friendship is a constant reminder that though we may not always see eye to eye, we can at least sit across a table and share a cup of coffee.</span></p> <p><span><em>Talia M.

Lieber \u2014 charged with lying to federal officials investigating his funding sources and ties to China \u2014 may try to convince jurors that he was swept up in the Trump administration\u2019s broader anti-China campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Lieber\u2019s legal team may try to focus its defense around how Lieber\u2019s prosecution connects to the Justice Department\u2019s China Initiative, an ongoing series of prosecutions beginning in 2018 related to allegations that China perpetrated intellectual property theft, according to experts.</span></p> <p><span>Federal authorities <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/1/29/lieber-federal-charges/\">arrested Lieber</a> in January on charges of making fraudulent statements to U.S. government officials who were investigating his funding sources. Officials alleged he misrepresented his affiliation with the Thousand Talents Program and failed to disclose funding from the Chinese government.</span></p> <p><span>A federal grand jury <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/6/10/lieber-grand-jury-indictment/\">indicted Lieber</a> in June for making false statements; he <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/6/17/lieber-not-guilty-plea/\">pled not guilty</a>. He was later charged in a <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/7/29/lieber-tax-offenses-charges/\">superseding indictment</a> with tax offenses related to the income he allegedly received from Chinese sources.</span></p> <p><span>Marc L. Mukasey, Lieber\u2019s attorney, said during an Oct. 16 hearing that Lieber intends to bring the case to trial promptly.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is Professor Lieber\u2019s desire to bring this case to trial as soon as possible,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cProfessor Lieber pleaded not guilty because he is not guilty,\u201d he added in an emailed statement Friday. \u201cWe intend to exercise our right to a speedy trial so the world can see how he\u2019s been used as a poster boy for a twisted political agenda and that the case against him is a crock.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Justice Department linked the arrest of Lieber and two Chinese nationals to its China Initiative in a January press release announcing their arrests.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThese cases are part of the Department of Justice\u2019s China Initiative, which reflects the strategic priority of countering Chinese national security threats and reinforces the President\u2019s overall national security strategy,\u201d the Justice Department\u2019s January press release reads.</span></p> <p><span>Lieber\u2019s lawyers may have seized on that public statement and others made by prosecutors around the time of Lieber\u2019s arrest as central to their strategy. In September, they filed a motion to compel production of a broad swath of materials related to the China Initiative and other Justice Department prosecutions of individuals in the Thousand Talents program.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAt the heart of the charges is what it means to participate in Thousand Talents,\u201d Torrey K. Young, Lieber\u2019s other attorney, said during the Oct. 16 hearing. \u201cThe government must benchmark what it means to participate in Thousand Talents.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Young said the materials from other China Initiative cases would be necessary because it is unclear \u201cwhere this line is\u201d on behavior related to China.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s a China Initiative prosecution,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>They also requested grand jury minutes, and Young argued that there had been \u201chyperbole around this case\u201d due to the U.S. government\u2019s \u201cextremely anti-China agenda.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe think there is enough disparity between how this case was characterized publicly and what it\u2019s really about\u201d to warrant releasing the grand jury minutes, she said.</span></p> <p><span>Prosecutors pushed back on the links to the broader initiative, however, noting Lieber had been charged with making false statements \u2014 not directly for his participation in Thousand Talents \u2014 so the materials would not be relevant to the case.</span></p> <p><span>Magistrate Judge Marianne B. Bowler sided with the government and denied the motion on Oct. 17.</span></p> <p><span>Elizabeth O. McCarthy, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the District of Massachusetts, declined to comment Tuesday on questions about whether the DOJ was now trying to distance Lieber\u2019s case from the China Initiative.</span></p> <p><span>Three legal experts who have worked on similar cases concurred that the case is linked to the China Initiative, given the nature of the case and the Justice Department\u2019s press release.</span></p> <p><span>Derek Adams, a partner at Potomac Law Group in Washington, said Lieber\u2019s team may be trying to use the case\u2019s context within the China Initiative to argue that the professor was \u201cswept up into this larger China initiative\u201d and thus unfairly prosecuted.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to loop in this case into the bigger picture, to try to have a jury see that perhaps Charles Lieber was kind of pulled into something that\u2019s broader than him,\u201d he said. \u201cThat that\u2019s effectively what the prosecution is about \u2014 this bigger initiative \u2014 rather than the specific statements that he made.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Adams, a former Justice Department trial attorney, said that in turn, it makes sense the government may want to distance Lieber\u2019s case from the initiative.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWith any case, they don't want to litigate their whole initiative \u2014 they want to just litigate this case, and they want to just make it about the specific false statements that they allege occurred,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can also understand then why the defense would want to make it about a broader movement that could potentially rub some folks the wrong way in a jury.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Though experts agreed the case against Lieber is tied to the China Initiative, they said it differs from other China Initiative cases because Lieber is not a Chinese national, but a prominent American scientist.</span></p> <p><span>Kristen M. Schwendinger \u2014 a senior counsel at Feldesman Tucker Leifer Fidell LLP specializing in practices including federal grants and government investigations \u2014 said Lieber\u2019s case is notable for that reason.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt stood out compared to others in a line of cases of university professors that happened to be from China, though not all cases have involved people of Chinese nationality,\u201d Schwendinger said.</span></p> <p><span>Catherine X. Pan \u2014 a partner at Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP and leader of the firm\u2019s U.S.-China transactional practice \u2014 said while she does not have access to private case documents, she was \u201csurprised\u201d by authorities\u2019 decision to pursue criminal charges against Lieber, rather than using other means.</span></p> <p><span>Pan noted that Lieber is one of only around 30 people in history to be elected into all three National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and she questioned whether the suit against Lieber helps the U.S. stay on top of the U.S.-China tech war.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe U.S. needs to have the top talent continuing to work for the U.S. and contribute to the U.S., so I don\u2019t know if this type of heavy-handed prosecution and criminal arrest and charges really serves that purpose,\u201d Pan said.</span></p> <p><span>Pan also said she thinks the exact amounts Lieber allegedly received from Chinese sources may have been lost in translation. While FBI special agent Robert Plumb\u2019s affidavit states that the Wuhan Institute of Technology agreed to pay Lieber $50,000 per month, prorated according to his actual time worked at the institute, the Justice Department\u2019s January press release alleged WIT paid Lieber $50,000 per month without such a qualification. Lieber would not have been able to work in China 12 months a year while also holding a full professorship at Harvard, Pan said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAmounts matter because we\u2019re thinking whether this is material enough to be a criminal charge,\u201d Pan said.</span></p> <p><span>In early October, Lieber <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/10/9/harvard-lieber-complaint/\">filed a civil case against Harvard</a>, alleging the University broke its contract by refusing to indemnify him for his defense. Experts said Lieber\u2019s civil suit aligns with the legal strategy that began with his not guilty plea.</span></p> <p><span>Pan called the indemnification suit a \u201ccritical step\u201d in Lieber\u2019s legal strategy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think this is a critical step in their legal strategy because without sufficient support and financial resources, lawyers can be very expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout that kind of resource and support, it would be very difficult for Professor Lieber to properly defend himself.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Schwendinger, the Feldesman Tucker counsel, said issues of indemnity are \u201cnot uncommon\u201d in cases against officers in any corporation.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is not uncommon for issues of indemnity clauses to come up in the wake of civil or criminal allegations against officers or executives in any corporation, whether or not it\u2019s in the university context or otherwise,\u201d Schwendinger said. \u201cIt is a matter of contract law whether or not Professor Lieber would be successful on his arguments. He certainly has a right to make this argument before the courts.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Adams, the Potomac Law partner, added that the civil suit is \u201cconsistent\u201d with Lieber\u2019s position in the criminal case.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you\u2019re not guilty in the criminal case, then you can understand why he would take the view, \u2018well, I should be covered,\u2019\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of the outcome in the civil case, however, Adams said Lieber\u2019s criminal prosecution may inform the actions of defense lawyers \u2014 and even federal prosecutors \u2014 in other China Initiative cases.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf this case goes to trial, it will be a really interesting case to watch because the DOJ will be put to a task in terms of proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will probably have an influence on how some other cases are either tried, brought, not brought, whether pleas are taken or not taken.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer James S.

{"title": "Washington Post Columnist Discusses Role of Journalism in the Upcoming Election | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Isabel G. Skomro", "body": "<p><span>Pulitzer-Prize winning Washington Post columnist Eugene H. Robinson spoke about the role of journalism in the 2020 presidential election at an Institute of Politics JFK Jr. Forum lecture Wednesday.</span></p> <p><span>The event, titled \u201cThe Challenges Facing the Media on November 3rd and Beyond,\u201d was hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center for Media, Politics, and Public Policy as part of the annual Theodore H. White Lecture series on Press and Politics. Shorenstein Center Director Nancy R. Gibbs moderated the lecture.</span></p> <p><span>Robinson opened the lecture by discussing how journalism has evolved to be what it is today.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to remember, but not so very long ago we actually had a set of rules, and a set of guardrails. And those rules and guardrails kept our public discourse more or less tethered to objective truth,\u201d Robinson said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cToday, our voices are easily and dangerously drowned out on the internet by voices that are not even remotely tethered to fact, and not remotely tethered to actual events,\u201d he added.</span></p> <p><span>Robinson talked about a possible election-day scenario which he called a \u201cred mirage,\u201d in which same-day votes favorable to President Trump are reported before absentee and mail-in ballot totals, giving the appearance of a substantial lead for Trump before official results are finalized.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOur job clearly is to tell people that this mirage is indeed a mirage, that it might actually turn out to be reality, but we won't know that until more of the votes are counted,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we'll have to convince our readers and our viewers to be patient until all the votes are counted. That will be a tall order.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In reporting political controversy up to the election, Robinson warned against the standard convention in journalism to give both sides equal weight.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf we know that one side is telling the truth, and the other side is lying, we need to tell people that, and we need to tell them that plainly and clearly and loudly,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cAnd we need to say it over and over and over again. Because repetition works.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In light of decreased public trust in news organizations, Gibbs spoke about the lessons learned from the 2016 election and the responsibilities that journalists have in ethical reporting in a Tuesday interview before the event.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cJournalists are much more aware of the risks of being manipulated, of the dangers, of the very high bar for verification of information, the risks of people trying to manipulate the media to cover a certain story or cover a story in a certain way,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cSo it's an even more treacherous terrain that journalists are operating in leading into an exceptionally important election.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Despite the challenges that journalists face, Robinson said he remains hopeful that journalism can champion the truth.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe should never be afraid or ashamed to advocate for truth,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt is a daunting road that lies ahead. But I think news organizations have one enormous advantage and I think ultimately it is a decisive advantage. And that is that truth is our superpower. So we just need to use it.\u201d</span></p>"}

He said he believes Cambridge residents \u2014 whom he described as politically engaged and liberal \u2014 would take to the streets to protest peacefully if Trump declared victory prematurely.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf President Trump declares that he\u2019s won before he\u2019s won, I could imagine that there\u2019ll be protests,\u201d he said. \u201cThat outcome where he doesn\u2019t accept the results, or the results are challenged and end up in court in the Supreme Court, I could imagine the same kind of protests, but you know, I\u2019d imagine they to be very peaceful.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Cambridge City Councilor Patricia M. Nolan \u201980 also said in an interview that she believes Cambridge residents will react peacefully to the results of the election.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cDo I expect unrest? Yes,\u201d she said. \u201cNot that we don\u2019t have extremes here, not that we don\u2019t have competing ideologies or political viewpoints, but the sense is that Massachusetts is not one of the places that is most likely to erupt in violence.</span></p> <p><span>Nolan cited peaceful demonstrators who protested in Boston this past summer over the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police.

Simauchi", "body": "<p><span><strong>UPDATED: October 30, 2020, 8:29 p.m.</strong></span></p> <p><span>Believing their ability to live, work, and study in the United States is in jeopardy, several of Harvard\u2019s international students say they are afraid of the prospect that President Donald J. Trump may be re-elected this year.</span></p> <p><span>For Sakiko Miyazaki \u201924, a freshman from Japan, her first months of adjusting to virtual college life have been marked by news coming out of the presidential race.</span></p> <p><span>Miyazaki is beginning her Harvard career from her bedroom in Tokyo. She could not join her freshman cohort because of a United States Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Order that prohibits international students from remaining in the country if their course load is only offered online this fall.</span></p> <p><span>Though the Trump administration has since withdrawn that ruling after a joint lawsuit from Harvard and M.I.T in early July, the reversal did not apply to newly admitted international students requiring F-1 sponsorship.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOh my gosh, I'm terrified,\u201d Miyazaki said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s especially frightening I\u2019d say as an international student who's enrolled in a U.S. university who can only come to the U.S. to study on a student visa.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWith the pandemic going on, like everything's just aggravated and there's just so much at stake that you can only begin to imagine seeing what the administration's been doing for the last four years,\u201d Miyazaki said. \u201cIf they are going to have another four years, what irreplaceable damage, in my perspective, could happen?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>On Sept. 25, DHS released a notice of proposed rulemaking that would limit the time period in which international students could study in the U.S. to fixed periods of four years. If a student came from a country with a visa overstay rate of greater than 10 percent, that time period would be just two years.</span></p> <p><span>The proposal, announced in the Federal Register on Sept. 25, was open for feedback until Oct. 26. DHS received more than 20,000 comments, though the agency is not guaranteed to change the final rule or make announcements on it until after Nov. 3.</span></p> <p><span>Joaquin Cortacans Sosa \u201923, an Uruguayan student who is on leave for the fall semester, also expressed concerns about the upcoming elections.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt's pretty scary to think about another Trump presidency and how that might like perpetuate everything he's been doing against immigration,\u201d Cortacans Sosa said.<br>\n<br>\r\nAdministration officials have sought to restrict immigration to the country since the president took office in Jan. 2017. In one high-profile case last year, immigration officials deported a Harvard freshman after finding allegedly anti-American social media posts on the student\u2019s feed; the student eventually made it to campus.</span></p> <p><span>Cortacans Sosa also said a second Trump term would lead to uncertainty over his visa status. The number of non-immigrant F1 visas issued to students looking to study in United States have markedly declined during the Trump presidency, falling by over 23 percent between 2016 and 2018, according to a report released by the Department of State.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cClearly, like, right now there's nothing clear about how he would want to change F visas, I know he released a new list of countries that are like the visas are going to only be valid for two years,\u201d Cortacans Sosa said. \u201cHowever, it is concerning to think that he can change, you know, the list of countries on a whim.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>For Guillaume Bouchard \u201923, a sophomore from Montreal, Canada who is taking the semester off, the Nov. 3 elections could not be any more important.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[The elections] are going to have huge consequences on myself as an international student, and I\u2019m Canadian,\u201d Bouchard said. \u201cCanadians have it the easiest by far of international students, and the election is still going to really impact me.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><strong><em>Correction: October 30, 2020</em></strong></span></p> <p><span><em>A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Guillaume A.

{"title": "\u2018More is More\u2019: Joe Kennedy III and Elizabeth Warren's Parallel Paths From Harvard Law School to Congress | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>On February 9, 2019, United States Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) took the stage to carry out a coveted task in Massachusetts politics: introducing U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2014 his former Harvard Law School professor \u2014 as she officially launched her 2020 presidential campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Greeting him with a hug at the podium was Senator Edward J. Markey, Warren\u2019s counterpart (D-Mass.). Markey, who spoke before Kennedy, praised him for \u201cbrilliantly\u201d delivering the Democratic response to President Donald J. Trump\u2019s State of the Union address in 2018.</span></p> <p><span>It was a neat and tidy picture: Massachusetts\u2019 three biggest-name Democrats, united around the common cause of electing Elizabeth Warren president.</span></p> <p><span>The trio\u2019s relationship, however, was about to become far more complicated.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy, who also introduced Warren at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, declared his former professor to be the \u201cleader who will restore the solidarity that Donald Trump stole.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Seven months later, Kennedy officially announced that he was kicking off a new candidacy of his own, and running in a Democratic primary to unseat Markey \u2014 who Warren had already endorsed.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Kennedy said in an interview with The Crimson last week that he is not disappointed Warren endorsed Markey.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cShe had endorsed Senator Markey months before I got in this race and I\u2019m not going to speculate as to what she would have done if the timing was different or if I jumped in the race,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the relationship that I have with her and I\u2019m grateful for her commitment to our state and I\u2019m proud of the race that she\u2019s running for president.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Warren\u2019s endorsement of Markey came just two days after the New York Times reported in August that Kennedy was considering challenging Markey in the Senate election. Kennedy entered the race roughly a month later, in late September.</span></p> <p><span>Despite lacking Warren\u2019s endorsement, Kennedy has continued to campaign for his former Law School mentor. On the campaign trail, he praises her progressive policies and often recounts his memories of being her student at the Law School. Experts note that Kennedy may benefit politically by tying himself to Warren\u2019s candidacy.</span></p> <p><span>Earlier this month, Kennedy stumped for Warren in New Hampshire, holding two events in Exeter, N.H. and Nashua, N.H. separately.</span></p> <p><span>Making a fervent case for Warren in New Hampshire \u2014 a state where he is not on the ballot \u2014 Kennedy offered nothing but praise for his former professor and prospective colleague in the Senate.</span></p> <p><span>For Sam Kelley, a Kennedy volunteer and Massachusetts resident who traveled to New Hampshire to knock on doors for Warren, Kennedy\u2019s continued support for Warren \u2014 despite her endorsement of Markey \u2014 is a testament to his leadership.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think Democrats in the end always have each other\u2019s backs,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cAnd I think with Congressman Kennedy still supporting a candidate that he believes in just shows the kind of leaders we have in Massachusetts.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy first met Warren while attending the Law School, where she taught him contracts law and bankruptcy law.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy told The Crimson that he enrolled in Warren\u2019s bankruptcy class in order to be taught by her.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI took bankruptcy because she was the teacher \u2014 not because I had a binding interest in bankruptcy, but because I knew that she could make me look at it differently and teach me something about it that I wouldn\u2019t otherwise get,\u201d Kennedy said.</span></p> <p><span>At the DNC in 2016, Kennedy told the story of his first day in Warren\u2019s class, when she called on him and he had to admit that he did not know the definition of the word assumpsit.</span></p> <p><span>On the campaign trail in New Hampshire this month, he told a version of the story about his first day.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe lasting contribution that I will make out of my life in public office is, without question, the fact that if you Google the word assumpsit, my picture comes up,\u201d Kennedy said in Nashua.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview, Kennedy said Warren was a \u201ctough\u201d professor.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat I think became clear over time was not just that she was tough, that she demanded the most out of her students every day, but that what she asked for was your best effort,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Warren and Kennedy\u2019s relationship improved after his first day blunder. Abbye J. Atkinson, a law school professor at the University of California Berkeley who was in Warren\u2019s section with Kennedy, said that the relationship between the two was \u201cjovial\u201d in class.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy recalled that he \u201cspent hours\u201d in Warren\u2019s office studying bankruptcy and contracts law. During one office hour appointment, he said he overheard her hurrying to get off the phone with former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) so that she could make time for his questions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI remember very clearly waiting outside her office for office hours and listening to her on the phone trying to get off the phone call,\u201d Kennedy said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty amazing thing that she\u2019d be willing to do that \u2014 and that she did do that,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s why I think her students are so devoted to her \u2014 because she made every effort to ensure that they got the attention that they needed to get what they deserved. And not every teacher did that.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Since Kennedy graduated from the Law School in 2009, his career has moved almost in sync with Warren\u2019s path in politics.</span></p> <p><span>Five months after Warren announced her candidacy for Senate in 2012, Kennedy \u2014 then a prosecutor for the Middlesex County district attorney\u2019s office \u2014 also announced a bid to join the Massachusetts congressional delegation.</span></p> <p><span>Both ultimately prevailed in their first ever races. Kennedy replaced longtime U.S. Representative Barney Frank in the Massachusetts fourth congressional district, and Warren defeated incumbent Republican Scott P. Brown to capture the seat held for decades by Kennedy\u2019s great-uncle, Edward M. \u201cTed\u201d Kennedy, who died in office in 2009.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy said in an interview that he and Warren would often consult each other about the difficulties of being rookie candidates.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019d obviously trade phone calls all the time and talk it through about the challenge of being first-time candidates,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cAnd to be fair, when the Senator ran, the level of scrutiny and attention placed on her was far different the level of scrutiny and attention placed on me.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was an amazing experience to be able to run my first race, obviously, with her at the top of the ticket in Massachusetts,\u201d Kennedy added.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy and Warren again made leaps together this election cycle, with her running for the presidency and him in his first race for Senate. Kennedy said the two still keep in touch.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe keep in reasonably consistent contact, particularly given the challenge that she\u2019s got and the places that she\u2019s got to be,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cBut given the challenges that she\u2019s got in front of her, I try to make sure that she has the space she needs to be able to run her race.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Michelle Wu, another former Warren student who now serves on the Boston City Council, said that Warren is always happy to see a former student thriving in their career.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think she\u2019s always especially excited and warm seeing her former students,\u201d said Wu, who has served as a surrogate for Warren in Iowa and New Hampshire. \u201cAt heart, she\u2019s a teacher. She just wants all of us that she counts as her students among the generations of young people that she\u2019s had the chance to teach \u2014 she just wants all of us to reach our full potential.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Even for two longtime friends, it is hardly customary for Senate campaigns to send hoards of volunteers and staffers across state lines to knock on doors. Kennedy\u2019s willingness to back Warren, experts say, may stem from both his stated desire for his former professor to win the presidency and his own political interest in Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span>Asked after the event in Nashua whether he was hoping to win over Warren\u2019s endorsement from Markey, Kennedy was quick to swat the notion down.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cLiterally never was once a consideration on my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cFor those who have made endorsements in this race long before I got in it, I\u2019ve not asked any single person there to reconsider it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Eric P. Lesser \u201907, a Kennedy ally and former aide to President Barack Obama, said in an interview that Kennedy\u2019s support for Warren is genuine.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think he\u2019s supporting her because he thinks she\u2019d be the best president, which is also the reason I\u2019m supporting her,\u201d Lesser said. \u201cBoth Joe and myself have been supporting Elizabeth since day one.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Some experts, though, observe a political edge to Kennedy\u2019s decision to campaign publicly and strongly for Warren.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that both things are likely to be true \u2014 that he has a lot of affinity for Elizabeth Warren, he would like to see her win the nomination and the presidency. But I also think it helps him politically to be seen in Massachusetts as doing everything he can to assist her candidacy,\u201d said Peter N. Ubertaccio, a political science professor at Stonehill College.</span></p> <p><span>How much of a factor Warren\u2019s endorsement will bare in the Senate race remains to be seen. Outside of a minute-and-a-half endorsement video put out by the Markey campaign in which Warren made the case for his re-election, she has largely stayed out of the race.</span></p> <p><span>David A. Hopkins \u201999, a Boston College political science professor, said it is still unclear how far Warren will go in supporting Markey, especially as she continues to campaign for the presidency.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhile she has nominally endorsed Markey, what we don\u2019t know is how much energy she will actually put behind supporting Markey in the campaign,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cWill she campaign hard for him? Will she cut an ad for him? Will she really lead the argument against Joe Kennedy?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe longer her presidential candidacy goes on, the less she\u2019s able to really mobilize personally on behalf of Markey,\u201d he added.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview, Kennedy reiterated a campaign strategy that he learned from Warren during the 2012 election. Kennedy said that in their conversations that year, \u201cone of the things that she said repeatedly\u201d is simply that \u201cmore is more.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe more people that come out, the more people that get engaged, the more people that get activated, the more people that believe in their system and believe they have something to contribute \u2014 that cascades up and down a ticket,\u201d Kennedy said.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy added that part of the lessons learned from 2012 was the importance of engaging more voters across the Democratic ticket \u2014 a tactic he is employing today as he campaigns for both himself and Warren.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPart of our job as candidates is to make sure that you are pulling more people in and you\u2019re challenging them to get engaged and you\u2019re giving them pathways to get engaged,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cYou\u2019re ensuring that the motivating force behind a bigger race can actually spill over into other races and other issues that you care about.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Jasper G.

Goodman", "body": "<p><span>The Defending Digital Democracy project \u2014 a Harvard Kennedy School initiative that aims to prevent election-related cyber attacks \u2014 held seminars last fall with the Iowa Democratic and Republican parties to prepare for potential threats to this year\u2019s caucuses.</span></p> <p><span>Among the dreaded scenarios they discussed were problems with the systems used to report results, according to Republican Party of Iowa spokesperson Aaron Britt, who attended the seminars.</span></p> <p><span>Britt said the seminars attempted to prepare caucus officials for a potential \u201cworst-case scenario.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere were cybersecurity experts, national security experts, election security experts to sort of run through different scenarios with us and help us prepare for what a worst-case-scenario might look like on caucus night,\u201d Britt said. \u201cBased on that, they sort of helped us develop messaging strategies and response strategies for any potential catastrophe that might take place.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>That nightmare appeared to become a reality Monday night, as Democratic caucus results were delayed due to problems with the app that the party used to report the outcomes. Roughly eight percent of Democratic precincts are yet to be reported as of Wednesday evening, and the race is still considered too close to call by the Associated Press.</span></p> <p><span>In a statement released on Tuesday, the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs \u2014 the HKS center that houses the initiative \u2014 said the Defending Digital Democracy Project held \u201ca bipartisan cyber security tabletop exercise\u201d in November to help the parties prepare for cyber threats ahead of Monday\u2019s caucuses.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe table top exercise simulated cyber and misinformation threats the parties could face prior to, during and after the caucuses,\u201d the statement read.</span></p> <p><span>The Defending Digital Democracy project has held cybersecurity preparedness exercises with election officials from 44 states, according to the statement.</span></p> <p><span>The statement also clarified the project had no role in developing or testing the app used during the caucuses.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was not a technical exercise, and the technologies used on Caucus Night were not used or tested during the exercise,\u201d the statement read. \u201cMembers of the D3P team, including Eric Rosenbach and Robby Mook, were not involved in vetting, approving or testing specific technologies used by the parties on Caucus Night at any time before, during or after this exercise.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Eric B. Rosenbach, the co-director of the Belfer Center, and Robert E. Mook, Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign manager in 2016, helped to start the Defending Digital Democracy Project.</span></p> <p><span>Iowa Democrats used an app developed by Shadow Inc. \u2014 a company founded by ex-Clinton campaign staffers \u2014 to have precincts report their results this year. In a press conference Tuesday, Iowa Democratic Party chairman Troy Price blamed a \u201ca coding error\u201d for the delay in the results.</span></p> <p><span>In a statement posted on Shadow Inc.\u2019s website, the company\u2019s CEO, Gerard Niemira, acknowledged the failures in the process used to relay the Democratic caucus results.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe sincerely regret the delay in the reporting of the results of last night's Iowa caucuses and the uncertainty it has caused to the candidates, their campaigns, and Democratic caucus-goers,\u201d Niemira\u2019s statement read. \u201cAs the Iowa Democratic Party has confirmed, the underlying data and collection process via Shadow's mobile caucus app was sound and accurate, but our process to transmit that caucus results data generated via the app to the IDP was not.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The state\u2019s Republican Party \u2014 which used a different app than the Democrats to tabulate their caucus results \u2014 had no reporting problems.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOur reporting system worked flawlessly,\u201d Britt said. \u201cWe never had an issue on caucus night.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The GOP race in Iowa was virtually uncontested. President Donald J. Trump received 97 percent of the state\u2019s Republican delegates.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard Government Professor Jon C. Rogowski, who was in Iowa for the caucuses, said that the party\u2019s failure to release timely results this year could lead to it losing its status as the first in the nation to vote.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis very well could lead to Iowa losing its place as the first state to participate in the primary process,\u201d Rogowski wrote in an email. \u201cA number of other proposals have been floated over the years, including a nationwide primary, or choosing another state that may be more demographically representative.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Iowa, which receives disproportionate attention from presidential candidates, has an electorate vastly less diverse than that of the broader Democratic electorate. While more than 9 in 10 Iowa caucus-goers on Monday were white, according to entrance polls, that figure is closer to 60 percent for the party as a whole.</span></p> <p><span>As of Wednesday evening, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg \u201904 held a narrow lead in Iowa over Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) with 92 percent of precincts reporting.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Jasper G.

Buttigieg \u201904 fended off rivals\u2019 recent criticisms at a New Hampshire Democratic Party event attended by nearly all the major Democratic primary candidates Sunday.</span></p> <p><span>Buttigieg, a former Crimson editorial editor, faced criticism over the weekend from former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., as well as United States Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).</span></p> <p><span>Biden \u2014 who came in fourth-place in in the Iowa caucuses last week and is lagging in the polls in New Hampshire, which will hold its primary on Tuesday \u2014 released an ad criticizing Buttigieg\u2019s work as the mayor of South Bend, Ind., on Sunday.</span></p> <p><span>Though he did not name Biden, Buttigieg responded to criticisms in the ad Sunday night at the McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club Dinner \u2014 an annual fundraiser for the New Hampshire Democratic party held at the 11,000-seat Southern New Hampshire University Arena.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI know some are asking: What business does a South Bend Mayor have seeking the highest office in the land?\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have an office in Washington. You don\u2019t have decades of experience in the establishment. The city you\u2019re the mayor of isn\u2019t even the biggest city in the country \u2014 it\u2019s more like Manchester, New Hampshire.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTo which I say, that is very much the point. Because Americans in small rural towns, in industrial communities \u2014 and yes, in pockets of our country\u2019s biggest cities \u2014 are tired of being reduced to a punchline by Washington politicians and ready for somebody to take their voice to the American capital,\u201d he added.</span></p> <p><span>Diego A.

Biden, Jr., former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg \u201904, and businessman Andrew M. Yang trekked to the Granite State to take part in canvassing and campaign events.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI really enjoy canvassing,\u201d Harvard College Democrats for Biden co-founder Amelia M. Apgar \u201920 said. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the most important parts of running a campaign because you actually are face-to-face speaking to the people who matter.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Apgar traveled to volunteer in the Manchester area with three other Harvard students who support Biden.</span></p> <p><span>Diego A. Garcia \u201920, who founded Harvard College Democrats for Biden alongside Apgar, said the former vice president\u2019s disappointing performance in the Iowa caucuses last Monday has sparked interest in the Biden group on campus. After technical problems <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/4/Iowa-caucus-results-delayed/\">delayed the results from being reported</a> last Monday, Biden finished in a distant fourth place with support from just under 16 percent of caucusgoers. The Associated Press eventually decided it could not declare a winner after significant errors in the results were found.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that our Harvard for Biden membership, in addition to a lot of traditional Harvard College Democrats members, [has] really appealed to other demographics within Harvard \u2014 other groups within Harvard who have not necessarily canvassed before,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cAnd they realize with the disappointing result \u2014 the gut punch that we received in Iowa \u2014 that it was not the time to be sitting on the sidelines.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Biden group\u2019s canvassing efforts focused mostly on voter turnout during the final weekend before the election.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAt this point, I\u2019m not trying to turn a Warren voter over to Biden or anything like that,\u201d said Garcia, who previously canvassed in both Iowa and New Hampshire for Biden.</span></p> <p><span>Some students knocking doors for other Democratic hopefuls took a different tack, however.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard College Democrats for Andrew Yang volunteers Michael Zhu \u201922 and J. Alexander White III \u201923, who door-knocked for much of the day on Saturday, engaged in sometimes lengthy conversations with voters at the door, asking residents about their priorities and attempting to convince them to support Yang.</span></p> <p><span>Zhu, a Social Studies concentrator who founded Harvard College Democrats for Andrew Yang, said canvassing helps to \u201cput a face\u201d on the Yang campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf I can even get some people to see both Andrew Yang, but also just a guy wearing a blue hat that says MATH knocking on their door and telling them about health care or about education reform \u2014 I think putting a face on the campaign is so much of what canvassing is about,\u201d Zhu said.</span></p> <p><span>The Yang canvassers ran into some New Hampshire residents who were skeptical of the former start-up executive\u2019s ability to pay for his signature proposal \u2014 a universal basic income program that would provide American adults with a $1,000-per-month \u201cFreedom Dividend.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Zhu directed one voter who expressed reservations about the policy toward <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/business/yang-warren-taxes-mankiw.html\">a New York Times op-ed</a> written by longtime Harvard economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who called Yang\u2019s plan \u201cpractical.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely something backed up by plenty of research,\u201d Zhu said.</span></p> <p><span>Despite some voters\u2019 concerns about paying for universal basic income, White said he thinks Yang is electable and could win some voters who supported President Donald J. Trump in 2016.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou have a guy who in a Democratic primary is actually willing to say that Donald Trump did not create all the evil in the world, and that, you know, some of the problems in the world actually created Donald Trump,\u201d White said.</span></p> <p><span>Roderick P. Emley \u201923, who canvassed for Warren in Rochester, N.H., on Saturday, said voters can sometimes get \u201creally honest with you on the doors in kind of an emotional way\u201d while discussing issues that have affected their lives.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOn one level it makes me so angry because when you\u2019re talking to people who have these stories, you realize how much injustice there is and that the deck is so stacked against so many people,\u201d Emley said. \u201cBut then you can be optimistic about it too, because it feels like doing work like that can actually make a difference.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Jasper G.

However, the Iowa caucuses are important for candidates to gain momentum going into later primaries, according to Harvard Government Professor Ryan D. Enos.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe literal significance in terms of the delegates is pretty minor because it\u2019s a small state and there\u2019s not many delegates awarded,\u201d Enos said. \u201cThere\u2019s an idea that [a win] can build momentum for a candidate and can make a candidate either look a lot more viable by exceeding expectations or look not as viable if they don\u2019t hold up to the expectations that people have for them.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Enos noted that the results of the Iowa caucuses and the next Tuesday\u2019s New Hampshire primary can influence the results of states with bigger delegate counts, such as California.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s people in California still that probably haven\u2019t made up their minds and when they look at these results in New Hampshire and Iowa, those are things that affect the way they\u2019re ultimately going to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cSo people in California can still be swayed by what happens in the early states.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Recent polling showed United States Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg \u201904, and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) running in a close four-way race in Iowa. U.S. Senator Amy J. Klobuchar (D-Minn.) also picked up traction among Iowans in recent weeks, according to an Emerson College poll.</span></p> <p><span>Iowa is one of only six states that uses caucuses \u2014 as opposed to voting in traditional primaries \u2014 to determine how its delegates at the national party conventions will vote. In caucuses, which are run by state parties, voters congregate in groups and lobby undecided attendees to to support their prefered candidates at precincts around the state.</span></p> <p><span>A number of Harvard affiliates participated in this year\u2019s caucus process.</span></p> <p><span>Nina B. Elkadi \u201922, a lifelong Iowa City resident, is taking a leave of absence from Harvard this spring in order to participate in the Democratic primary process. In addition to working as a full-time organizing intern for the Elizabeth Warren campaign, Elkadi was selected as a precinct captain for an Iowa City precinct.</span></p> <p><span>As precinct captain, Elkadi \u2014 a member of the Harvard College Democrats and Harvard for Warren \u2014 was responsible for speaking on behalf of the Warren campaign at her precinct and convincing caucus goers to support her candidacy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI need to be here. I need to be completely here, not even a little bit thinking about Harvard, or classes, or anything like that,\u201d Elkadi said. \u201cBeing on Harvard's campus, I can do almost nothing as close to what I can do at home on the field, talking to people I grew up with.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>For the first time in its history, the Iowa Democratic Party also held satellite caucus events around the country where Iowans outside the state could still vote. At a remote event at the Democracy Center in Harvard Square Monday, Sanders topped other primary candidates with 22 votes from out-of-state Iowans. He was awarded two delegates.</span></p> <p><span>Warren finished in second place at the Cambridge event with 20 voters and two delegates, Buttigieg finished third with eight votes and one delegate, and Andrew Yang had one voter and received no delegates.</span></p> <p><span>Lottie Gidaul \u2014 a Wesleyan University freshman who hails from Iowa City \u2014 traveled to Cambridge to participate in the remote caucus. Gidal said she was persuaded to support Warren by other caucus goers.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI make up a lot of my decisions by hearing other people\u2019s perspectives and hearing what they\u2019re excited about,\u201d Gidal said. \u201cMy family is very much excited about Warren and a lot of my friends are excited about Warren.

{"title": "Update Available: Rethinking Tech in Class | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The email from former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power came into my inbox at 8:09 p.m. \u201cHi Kaivan - please don\u2019t be on your phone in class - it is super distracting to your classmates, your profs, and \u2014 above all \u2014 to you! really important. Thanks!\u201d I was in DPI 535: \u201cMaking Change When Change is Hard,\u201d a Harvard Kennedy School course the Ambassador was teaching with her husband, famed legal scholar Cass R. Sunstein \u201975. I was embarrassed, as the class had a no technology policy. I responded immediately, apologizing, assuring Ambassador Power that it wouldn\u2019t happen again, and noting that just five minutes before class, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had resigned \u2014 a significant moment for anyone focused on change-making and the fight for justice.</span></p> <p><span>Last week I was reminded of that email, in the first session of my Constitutional Law course, when our professor noted that she bans the use of electronics in class, citing \u201cthe pedagogy.\u201d The professor told us how exciting the course would be this semester given the relevance of the ongoing impeachment hearings \u2014 and encouraged us to keep up with the news. Ironically, impeachment proceedings were literally ongoing this week, including during our 1-3 p.m. class timeslot.</span></p> <p><span>As an online influencer in the progressive political space, I volunteer my time to help the Democratic National Convention, leading presidential candidates, and others amplify key messages surrounding the Trump administration in real-time. Harvard Law professors, politicians, journalists, and celebrities engage with my content directly. As a student at the Kennedy School and the Law School, experiencing the first impeachment of my adult life in this participatory way is a rare and educational opportunity. While it\u2019s important to pay attention in class, spending five minutes of a two-hour-long session reviewing and responding to highlights of the hearings not only allows me to make important connections that will serve me in my legal career (something the Law School should support), but it also allows me to consider the ideas we are learning in a course such as Constitutional Law against an urgent real-world backdrop.</span></p> <p><span>These anti-technology classroom policies are not unique cases. At my MBA program at the Yale School of Management, at the Harvard Kennedy School, and now at Harvard Law School, I\u2019ve been banned from using any technology in many classes, even to take notes. It\u2019s not just a huge disadvantage for someone with illegible handwriting. It\u2019s infantilizing and counterproductive.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s true \u2014 I made a choice to be a student, and some could argue if I wanted to keep pace with the real world, I should have chosen to work instead. However, this logic is flawed because it undervalues the powerful potential of digital access in the classroom. The first, which I described above, is the discretion that technology affords ambitious, busy multi-taskers to attend to occasional external urgent matters \u2014 personal or professional \u2014 while still being present and learning in class.</span></p> <p><span>There are also ways technology amplifies even the internal procedures and substance of classes. Allowing students to use technology in the classroom as they would in reality not only creates more time for critical discussion, but greatly expands the level of information and accuracy that can be brought into those discussions. Students and professors won\u2019t spend five minutes searching page by page for that specific Justice Elena Kagan reference in a 100-page Supreme Court opinion \u2014 someone will \u2318F the key phrase and the class will move on with the conversation. A loosely remembered relevant source no longer stays on the tip of the tongue, but is confirmed with quick research and shared to enrich the class discussion. Foolish questions neither go unanswered, nor do they waste valuable class time \u2014 a win-win for everyone paying thousands of dollars for a single course.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps a more widely accepted argument is that banning technology forces students to learn in an antediluvian way. This outdated learning mode will never mirror the practice mode of the digital age. We won\u2019t memorize the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u2014 we\u2019ll Google them. We won\u2019t write out Bayes\u2019 Theorem from memory and \u201cplug and chug\u201d \u2014 the process will be automated.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019ve already experienced this generational shift. When I was in elementary school, cursive was being phased out. In undergrad, I took notes exclusively on my laptop.

Tribe \u201962 and Alan M. Dershowitz argue differently, though. The pair of legal scholars has spent the past several weeks engaging in a public, personal feud unlike perhaps any other at the University, sparked by Dershowitz\u2019s decision to defend President Donald J. Trump in his Senate impeachment trial.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI thought that he had become a bit of a publicity hog and a celebrity seeking fellow who cared less about justice than about fame and fortune,\u201d Tribe said in an interview about Dershowitz.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe is a zealot and a partisan,\u201d Dershowitz said about Tribe.</span></p> <p><span>Dershowitz formally joined Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/1/17/dershowitz-trump-impeachment-team/\">defense team</a> on Jan. 17, announcing on Twitter he would deliver oral statements to the Senate to explain the constitutional arguments against impeachment. The trial, which concluded Wednesday, cleared Trump of both charges against him \u2014 abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.</span></p> <p><span>Soon after Dershowitz\u2019s announcement, Tribe joined a chorus of legal scholars questioning his arguments. Still, Tribe was one of few critics who could claim personal ties to Dershowitz spanning decades.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAlthough I am hesitant to call out a friend and former colleague as being a danger to democracy, I finally decided that Alan Dershowitz because of his \u2013 at least, former \u2013 credibility had become such a danger that I could no longer hold back, and I, therefore, began to feel quite free to say what an idiotic argument I thought he was making,\u201d Tribe said in an interview last Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span>Dershowitz, for his part, said Tribe has unfairly attempted to silence him.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe critical senators seem to accept my argument, or at least to take it seriously. And I would expect that fellow academics would do the same,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>While Dershowitz and Tribe may disagree about the merits of impeaching Trump, they share at least one thing: a resume littered with prestigious accomplishments.</span></p> <p><span>A Brooklyn, N.Y. native, Dershowitz graduated from Brooklyn College and Yale Law School before joining the Harvard Law School faculty at age 25. Touted as \u201cthe best-known criminal lawyer in the world\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s most public Jewish defender\u201d in his Law School biography, he has defended high-profile and controversial clients such as billionaire and accused sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and football star O.J. Simpson.</span></p> <p><span>Law School professor Charles Fried said in an interview Wednesday that he considers Dershowitz an intelligent scholar.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe was always considered an electric and brilliant teacher of criminal law just right from the very start,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Tribe, a graduate of both the College and the Law School, began teaching at Harvard in 1968. He helped write the constitutions of South Africa, the Czech Republic, and the Marshall Islands, and holds the title University Professor \u2014 considered Harvard\u2019s highest academic honor for faculty.</span></p> <p><span>Though the two professors never worked together directly on campus, both described their relationship prior to Dershowitz\u2019s retirement as professional and good-natured.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI wouldn't say we were close friends, but we were certainly friends,\u201d Tribe said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI proposed him to President Clinton for Solicitor General of the United States,\u201d Dershowitz said. \u201cI've always had respect for his ideas.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Before recent events, Tribe said he and Dershowitz had just one prior dust-up. While both teaching at the Law School in 1992, the two professors disagreed about the appropriateness of a Harvard Law Review \u201cparody\u201d of a colleague\u2019s deceased wife.</span></p> <p><span>Tribe said he wanted the Law School to note the incident on the transcripts of the students who wrote the article; Dershowitz argued against censuring them.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEver since then, we\u2019ve been a little distant because he thought he is the only pure civil libertarian around and that I was one of the compromised ones, and one of the things that is most kind of difficult to deal with about Alan is how he thinks that he\u2019s the only principled person around,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>The 1992 argument, however, was just a preview of events to come.</span></p> <p><span>Though Tribe said he and Dershowitz have had some previous differences of opinion, their arguments have become increasingly public amid the impeachment debate.</span></p> <p><span>In both his formal defense of Trump and online, Dershowitz claimed that the charges brought by the U.S. House of Representatives against Trump are not impeachable offenses according to the Constitution. He said the Constitution does not explicitly include the terms used to describe the charges and that its authors would not approve of them.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy views are that impeachment cannot be based on vague, open-ended terms like \u2018abuse of power\u2019 and \u2018obstruction of Congress,\u2019\u201d Dershowitz said. \u201cThose terms can be applied to almost any president, and they\u2019re dangerous.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Tribe said that \u2014 even if the House\u2019s language contains ambiguities \u2014 the impeachment trial should rest upon Trump\u2019s actions rather than linguistic questions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cObviously, that phrase in itself has a degree of vagueness and ambiguity, but that\u2019s only the label of the impeachment charge,\u201d Tribe said. \u201cIn order to determine whether someone has been charged properly with impeachable offenses, one has to look at the specific conduct that is claimed.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt seems that my former colleague has this view that \u2018abuse of power\u2019 is not a permissible category of impeachable offense, which couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth,\u201d he added. \u201cAbuse of power is the characteristic impeachable offense.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Following Dershowitz\u2019s testimony before the Senate, several legal experts joined Tribe in countering his arguments. Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, compared Dershowitz to opponents of the climate change movement.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cDershowitz\u2019s view of what constitutes an impeachable offense is as indefensible and rejected by scholars as climate deniers,\u201d Mariotto wrote in a tweet on Wednesday. \u201cNot a single constitutional scholar agrees with his view.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Michael J. Gerhardt, a law professor at the University of North Carolina who specializes in conflicts between Congress and the President, disputed another aspect of Dershowitz\u2019s claim.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cProfessor Dershowitz made what I think was a very bizarre argument about if a president believes something\u2019s in his purse \u2014 if he believes that what he\u2019s doing is in the nation's best interest \u2014 he apparently can do anything he wants, and that strikes me as completely wrong,\u201d Gerhardt said.</span></p> <p><span>But Tribe said his concerns about Dershowitz\u2019s arguments stretch beyond impeachment.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy fundamental disagreement with Professor Dershowitz is that if his view were to prevail, the country would be fundamentally at the mercy of future presidents who want to use their official powers in order to benefit themselves and corrupt our elections and ensure their reelection,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Dershowitz and Tribe have disagreed about Law School issues and constitutional questions. But the duo have also criticized one another personally in tweets and interviews.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTribe so afraid of the Senate hearing my constitutional arguments that he actually says, I \u2018should not be allowed\u2019 to make them. Is that the American way?\u201d Dershowitz wrote on Twitter on Jan. 20.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe @AlanDersh Narcissist defense puts even the Twinkie defense to shame,\u201d Tribe wrote on Jan. 30, referencing a controversial legal argument made while Dan White faced trial for the murder of former San Francisco mayor Harvey Milk.</span></p> <p><span>Dershowitz claimed the dispute has been largely one-sided, charging that Tribe made legal arguments personal.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTribe decided to engage in personal ad hominem attacks on me and my ideas,\u201d Dershowitz said. \u201cHe characterized my legal conclusions as \u2018bonkers\u2019 and \u2018crud, C-R-U-D\u2019 despite the fact that they are supported by 19th-century scholars, justices, former justices, and lawyers.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Tribe countered that claim: he alleged Dershowitz has told multiple reporters that Tribe is jealous of him.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNothing could be further from the truth,\u201d Tribe said. \u201cThe person I would least like to be on our faculty is Alan Dershowitz.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In a bid to move their arguments from Twitter, Dershowitz said he hoped to engage Tribe in an in-person debate over the law.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI challenge my friend and former colleague, Larry Tribe, to an academic serious debate about these issues \u2014 about what the constitutional grounds for impeachment are, what the framers intended \u2014 and I hope you will accept my challenge instead of, you know, juvenile name-calling and schoolyard epithets,\u201d Dershowitz said.</span></p> <p><span>At least one student who knew both Tribe and Dershowitz said comparing the pair\u2019s arguments is fruitless. Political commentator Elie Y. Mystal \u201900, a graduate of the Law School, wrote in an email that the two professors engage in entirely different lines of work.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s like comparing an astrophysicist to a zoologist,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey\u2019re both technically scientists, but if you just go to random office hours in the Science Center asking \u201cwhen will we die\u201d you\u2019re going to get very different answers.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Kelsey J.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In the wake of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death, the Supreme Court has been thrust into the center of a political battle. As senators clear the way for President Trump to nominate a new justice before the election, conversations about political hypocrisy, court reform, and the potential legislative consequences of a 6-3 majority conservative court abound. To help untangle the knotted relationship between politics and the court, FM spoke with three Harvard Law School professors, all scholars of constitutional law and the Supreme Court.</span></p> <p><span>One source of the current scrutiny of the court stems from the contradictory actions of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other Republican senators, such as Lindsey Graham (R-N.C.). In light of McConnell\u2019s establishment of the precedent that a Supreme Court justice would not be confirmed during an election year in 2016, Republican senators\u2019 current decisions to vote on President Donald J. Trump\u2019s nominee have drawn criticism. Professor Richard H. Fallon Jr. deems such action \u201crank hypocrisy,\u201d and fellow professor Michael J. Klarman similarly wrote in an emailed statement that \u201cthis is a hypocrisy of a level rarely seen before in American history.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In 2016, after blocking President Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick B. Garland \u201974 with almost a year to the election, Graham said, \u201cI want you to use my words against me. If there\u2019s a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said, \u2018Let\u2019s let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination.\u2019\u201d Graham\u2019s refusal to be \u201cbound by what he said in the past\u201d leads Fallon \u201cto think the only conclusion to be drawn is that this is all about politics.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Republican senators have justified their reversal by arguing that the principle set in 2016 is limited to times when the different parties control the presidency and Senate. This reasoning, Klarman says, \u201cmakes little sense.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The key factors in Graham\u2019s decision are proximity to the election and divided government, Klarman explains. The election is closer than it was in 2016, and both the presidency and Senate are likely to change hands. So if \u201cthe people\u201d were meant to have a say in Scalia\u2019s replacement, they should also have a say in Ginsburg\u2019s. And if divided government is the more important consideration, this implies that a Senate majority of one party should never confirm the nominee of an opposing president.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat has never been the norm, and is a formula for paralysis,\u201d he writes. Graham\u2019s \u201clame argument\u201d for confirming Trump\u2019s nominee is also based on the alleged Democratic mistreatment of Brett M. Kavanaugh in 2018. But during those hearings, Graham reiterated his opposition to appointing a Supreme Court justice in 2020.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt shows that Republican senators only care about the raw exercise of power, not principle,\u201d Klarman writes.</span></p> <p><span>Such criticisms have led to further examinations of the Supreme Court\u2019s current structure. As election day nears and a Democrat-controlled Senate becomes possible, senators are seriously considering court reform. Law professor Mark V. Tushnet identifies three main options: establishing term limits for justices, expanding the size of the court, or jurisdiction stripping, which involves limiting the court\u2019s ability to hear cases on specific subjects, such as abortion or gun rights. Tushnet \u2014 the chair of the academic advisory board to a group called \u201cTake Back the Court,\u201d whose agenda is expanding the size of the court \u2014 feels that court expansion, or \u201ccourt packing,\u201d is the most viable.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTerm limits and jurisdiction stripping aren\u2019t attractive to politicians in the short run,\u201d Tushnet says. Term limits wouldn\u2019t take effect for years, and penning a statute for jurisdiction stripping may prove very difficult. \u201cIf we think about it from a politicians\u2019 point of view, expanding the size of the court accomplishes their goal very quickly,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not politically easy, but it\u2019s sort of easy as a matter of legislation, to write a statute.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Klarman says that \u201cDemocrats have no choice but to unpack the court after Republicans have packed it.\u201d After Senator McConnell \u201cstole a seat in 2016,\u201d a conservative court may block \u201cevery progressive measure that a Biden administration might be able to pass,\u201d Klarman claims.</span></p> <p><span>Anticipating pushback, Klarman identifies arguments that mitigate the fear of a never-ending cycle of court expansion.</span></p> <p><span>First, he writes, Republicans instigated their own form of court packing in 2016 when Democrats \u201cearned the right to appoint a fifth liberal justice\u201d and McConnell blocked the vote.</span></p> <p><span>Second, \u201cRepublicans will pack the Court regardless of whether Dems do so, as they are about to prove right now.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Finally, a Democratic victory and passage of \u201centrenching legislation\u201d to increase the court\u2019s size would end Republican voter suppression and create a more progressive electorate. \u201cRepublicans,\u201d he adds, \u201cwould be forced to change their policies or never win another election.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Without structural changes, however, the addition of Amy Coney Barrett to the court may have legislative consequences that undo some of the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark cases from recent decades. If Barrett is appointed, creating a 6-3 conservative majority on the court, Klarman, Fallon, and Tushnet all predict that legislation concerning affirmative action, gun control, abortion, and more will be affected. Fallon expects \u201cat least a rollback of abortion rights, if not possibly the overruling of Roe v. Wade, within five years or so,\u201d while Tushnet deems this a \u201cnear-certainty.\u201d Tushnet says that \u201cthere\u2019s a very high probability that the court would find affirmative action in public institutions unconstitutional,\u201d and Klarman writes that the new court \u201cwill expand gun rights,\u201d suspecting that \u201ca majority today would think the assault weapons ban of the early 1990s would be unconstitutional.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The current nomination process may also cause the public to lose faith in the court\u2019s ability to fulfill its role and question the trustworthiness of its decisions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think in a politicized era, increasingly, there are people, no matter who\u2019s on the Supreme Court, no matter what it decides, [who will] point to the Supreme Court and say \u2018I don\u2019t trust them to be the institution with the power and responsibility to decide these issues of vast consequence,\u2019\u201d Fallon says.</span></p> <p><span>The public\u2019s trust historically stemmed from a belief that the Supreme Court \u201clay outside of politics\u201d and would not be manipulated by either party for politically-motivated goals. That trust, however, appears to have eroded over time, and fierce partisanship has led citizens to view politics and law as a \u201czero-sum game.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s not a win for one and a loss for others, it\u2019s trying to figure out what\u2019s best for the country going forward,\u201d Fallon says. \u201cI think faith that our country is governed that way, that the Supreme Court is an institution that proceeds with that as its goal is waning on many fronts. I think that is very very very sad, potentially tragic, and I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re headed.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><em>\u2014 Staff writer Jane Z.

{"title": "Why SNL Isn\u2019t Funny Anymore | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I\u2019ve fallen into a pattern of going to sleep early. Sometimes as early as 9 p.m. So, staying up until 11:30 p.m. to watch the season premiere of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d \u2014 even though I love the show and have been eagerly awaiting its return for months \u2014 was a commitment, an action of intention.</span></p> <p><span>When season 46 kicked into gear on October 3, I was anxious to see the cold open, which would no doubt satirize that week\u2019s presidential debate. The debate had been beyond chaotic, providing an abundance of material to draw from. And indeed, Alec Baldwin\u2019s President Donald Trump interrupts the moderator a lot. Jim Carrey\u2019s Joe Biden struggles to hold back his seething anger and disdain. Trump says something stupid; Biden loses his train of thought. We\u2019ve seen these bits before, and honestly, we\u2019ve seen them done better. The scene comes to a close with a humorous but not so covertly sincere plea to the viewer to vote. For Biden, of course.</span></p> <p><span>At this point I thought, Okay, the cold open fell a little flat, but the monologue can\u2019t possibly disappoint. This is Chris Rock we\u2019re talking about. One of the funniest comedians out there. He starts his monologue, but his use of pronouns is kind of strange, isn\u2019t it? \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take it serious,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2fFJvh0pp8\">says</a> about the election. \u201cYou know, like I watch, the Republicans take it serious.\u201d We: himself and the viewer at home. But then, a group that is not so we. The Republicans: a they.</span></p> <p><span>Conservatives are the outsiders here, and Democrats are the in-group. Liberals are a part of this community \u2014 they are the \u201cus.\u201d Conservatives are some strange collective out in the ether that couldn\u2019t possibly do something as normal as consume primetime media.</span></p> <p><span>Chris Rock, your Hollywood is showing. It seems you\u2019ve spent too much time away from the political diversity that exists in this country, sheltered among your high-rolling friends. You must have forgotten that <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx\">tens of millions</a> of Americans identify as conservative. Surely some of them watch SNL and are part of the \u201cwe\u201d you are talking to.</span></p> <p><span>Begging audience members to vote for a specific candidate is not funny. Excluding Republicans from the joke doesn\u2019t just narrow SNL\u2019s audience. Allowing a small group of joke writers to decide who\u2019s allowed in popular culture creates further divisions in a country that\u2019s already pulling apart at the seams.</span></p> <p><span>Humor is more than lightheartedness. It can powerfully deliver political messages in a digestible, persuasive way. Humor is subversive. It is a means of survival. It makes a statement and sets a cultural tone.</span></p> <p><span>As philosopher Henri Bergson <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4352/4352-h/4352-h.htm\">claims</a>, laughter is distinctly human and social. Laughter finds amusement in all things relating to human life: mobility and its malfunctions, interactions and their blunders, the non-mechanical nature of human existence. This connects directly to laughter\u2019s social nature. Humans are social creatures. We bond over the mishaps we all encounter, using laughter to react, heal, and brave the challenges we face. We laugh along to show support and camaraderie.</span></p> <p><span>However, there is a dangerous flip side. Humor can draw boundaries between factions. Who finds what funny can pull people together, but it can also create tribes and leave some people on the outskirts.</span></p> <p><span>Humor finds its cruel edge when we laugh at and not with. Malice seeps into jokes far too often and leads to a laughter that harms. As a society, we should be striving to move away from willful debasement of those who are not like us. We should seek to be inclusive, open-minded, and respectful \u2014 even in our jokes. Or if we lose a little bit of that respect, at least we should prevent ourselves from directing distaste and anger at one group alone. It is possible to keep comedy subversive and entertaining while simultaneously preventing it from being plain mean.</span></p> <p><span>SNL has been beloved by Americans for decades. It should continue to be an American staple. But that means it has to be accessible to all Americans. It should be critical and sharp, witty and boundary-pushing. Backing one political candidate and writing off the party you find inferior is none of those things. It\u2019s the easy way out for people who don\u2019t want to challenge their perspectives or reach outside their bubble.</span></p> <p><span>So show us Trump\u2019s aggression in interrupting the moderator, but make us rethink what it means to have an aggressive president. Show us Biden\u2019s resentment, but comment on the broader significance it has for voters who share this view. Comedy\u2019s role is not to take jabs for the sake of taking jabs. It is to reveal the parts of issues that hide beneath the surface. There are greater implications to what happened at the presidential debate, and laughter is the first step to understanding. If we can laugh at the forces that divide us, we take away their power.

Deshpande", "body": "<p><span>Researchers at Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center found that unsubstantiated concerns about widespread mail-in voter fraud in the 2020 election are mainly spread by high-ranking Republicans \u2014 including Donald Trump \u2014 and conventional media, according to a working paper released Oct. 2.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard Law School professor Yochai Benkler and others analyzed \u201cover fifty-five thousand online media stories, five million tweets, and seventy-five thousand posts on public Facebook pages which garnered millions of engagements.\u201d They found that \u2014 contrary to conventional wisdom \u2014 social media played a secondary role in spreading disinformation, though they counted Trump\u2019s Twitter account as a media source rather than as a social media account.</span></p> <p><span>Benkler said he and the team hope their findings will help assure the legitimacy of this fall\u2019s election.</span></p> <p><span>He also said that the paper ought to make policymakers reconsider their assumptions about so-called \u201cfake news.\u201d They should renew their focus on traditional media sources, such as local television and syndicated articles, since most relatively apolitical voters rely on them, he added.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou need to shift your frame towards these very non-sexy, non-tech outlets, given who their audience is and given that they\u2019re really the only remaining persuadable audience,\u201d Benkler said.</span></p> <p><span>The report found that, of the viewers and readers of local media, between 15 to 20 percent believe voter mail-in fraud would be a major problem. Consumers of national sources like the New York Times or NPR were less likely to share those worries.</span></p> <p><span>The report found that CNN, the Washington Post, Trump\u2019s Twitter account, NBC, NPR and Politico \u2014 among others \u2014 played the largest role in spreading information about voter fraud.</span></p> <p><span>The Berkman Klein team began studying information dissemination about a dozen years ago, publishing \u201con more specific topics, like intellectual property legislation,\u201d according to Benkler. They moved to studying larger issues after the 2016 election, publishing an analysis of that election in 2018, and started focusing on mail-in voting this summer.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt became clear to me that this one controversy, specifically on fraud related to mail-in ballots, was becoming the major disinformation campaign in the 2020 election, the one that was really potentially threatening voter participation,\u201d Benkler said.</span></p> <p><span>The report calls for a reevaluation of journalistic standards of objectivity, which, it argues, force reporters to be overly sympathetic to falsehoods stated by prominent figures.</span></p> <p><span>Benkler said he views so-called \u201cfact-checking columns,\u201d separate portions of a newspaper debunking false claims, as unhelpful. He advocates instead for what he calls a \u201csandwich approach,\u201d one in which journalists correct false statements in the same articles in which they originally reported them.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s a way to stay true to the normative commitments of professional journalism without becoming replicators and reinforcers of the propagandists\u2019 message,\u201d he said.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Petition Calls on Harvard Law School to Oppose Supreme Court Appointment | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Kelsey J. Griffin", "body": "<p><span>More than 300 Harvard Law School students and affiliates signed an online petition calling on the school to provide a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee opposing the appointment of a new Supreme Court Justice before Inauguration Day.</span></p> <p><span>The petition is sponsored by the <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/5/27/commencement-2020-ppp/\">People\u2019s Parity Project</a> \u2014 a law student organization that aims to reform the legal profession \u2014 and has been signed by notable alumni including Former Senator Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.), Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.), and Professor Emeritus Laurence H. Tribe \u201962.</span></p> <p><span>Following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September, President Donald J. Trump nominated Judge Amy V. Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. The nomination \u2014 which took place only weeks before this November\u2019s federal election \u2014 drew immediate <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/30/scotus-nomination-reactions/\">criticism</a> from several members of the Law School faculty, including Tribe.</span></p> <p><span>The authors of the petition claim U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who supports Barrett\u2019s nomination, contradicted his 2016 stance on filling Court vacancies during presidential election years. Four years ago, McConnell opposed former U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s attempt to fill a Supreme Court vacancy left by former Justice Antonin Scalia in March 2016.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen Justice Antonin Scalia died nine months before the election, McConnell refused to give Judge Merrick Garland a hearing, citing the impending election,\u201d the petition reads. \u201cThere, the election was months out; here, the election has already begun.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Daniel S. Medwed, a Law School graduate and former Visiting Professor of Law, said he shares the petitioners\u2019 concerns about Coney Barrett\u2019s nomination. He claimed the reversal of the Republican Party\u2019s stance from 2016 has made him \u201cfeel as though the process is illegitimate and that we shouldn\u2019t abide by it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Third-year Harvard Law student Brendan Schneiderman, an author of the petition, said a Supreme Court nomination before the next president is inaugurated will create a conservative majority on the Court that may jeopardize legislation Democratic nominee Joseph R. Biden Jr. plans to support if elected President in November.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s concerning from a democratic perspective because we\u2019re in the midst of an election right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of folks on campus and in the Harvard community, generally, were feeling the same kind of angst and frustration and disappointment that this, you know, travesty of a confirmation was going to go forward.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Schneiderman also noted that Law School administrators sent emails to students about honoring Justice Ginsburg\u2019s legacy and values. Still, members of the People\u2019s Parity Project felt the school needed to specifically oppose Barrett\u2019s confirmation.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was an underwhelming message, I think when, when it was coupled with a complete silence about what was going on in the Senate,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>The petition argues that if the Law School demands the Senate to keep Ginsburg\u2019s seat open until after Inauguration Day, other institutions would follow with similar demands. It also states the Law School\u2019s opposition to the nomination would assure students and affiliates of its commitment to fairness.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf the Law School cares about the legitimacy of the Court, if it wants its students to believe in the rule of law and advocate for equal justice, if Dean Manning truly hopes that we \u2018honor\u2019 and \u2018celebrate\u2019 the values that Justice Ginsburg embodied, then we ask: how can the Law School be silent now?\u201d the petition reads.</span></p> <p><span>Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email that the Law School serves students, staff, alumni, and faculty with a diverse array of viewpoints and opinions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cRather than seeking to express a view for the institution as a whole, the Law School embraces the pluralism of our community and supports its members in their right to express their own views,\u201d he wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Medwed, however, said he feels it is important for the Law School to denounce the nomination due to leading law schools\u2019 influence over the legal system.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard Law School, of course, is one of the most elite institutions in the country, and for the institution to say this process is not appropriate \u2014 this is not how it should work, this is not how it has worked \u2014 I think would be potentially meaningful,\u201d Medwed said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWould it stop the ball rolling? Probably not, but that doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be done,\u201d he added.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Kelsey J. Griffin can be reached at kelsey.griffin@thecrimson.com.

{"title": "DOJ Sues Yale for Racial Discrimination Amid Concurrent Harvard Investigation and Lawsuit | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Benjamin L. Fu", "body": "<p><span>The United States Department of Justice sued Yale University Thursday over charges of racial discrimination against Asian American and white applicants in its admissions process.</span></p> <p><span>The Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/8/16/doj-yale-admissions-harvard-impact/\">determined</a> in mid-August that Yale violated civil rights law by using race as a \u201cdeterminative factor\u201d in its admissions process, alleging it disadvantaged Asian American and white applicants. At the time, the Justice Department demanded Yale change its admissions procedures in a press release, threatening to sue unless Yale complied.</span></p> <p><span>Federal authorities are also <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/18/foia-doj-continues-investigation/\">investigating</a> Harvard\u2019s admissions process \u2014 an effort that was ongoing through at least last December.</span></p> <p><span>Assistant Attorney General Eric S. Dreiband of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division explained the Justice Department\u2019s reasoning in a press release announcing the lawsuit.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAll persons who apply for admission to colleges and universities should expect and know that they will be judged by their character, talents, and achievements and not the color of their skin,\u201d said Dreiband in the release. \u201cTo do otherwise is to permit our institutions to foster stereotypes, bitterness, and division.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Yale University President Peter Salovey defended the University\u2019s admissions process in a statement Thursday, rejecting the Justice Department\u2019s claims of discrimination.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOur admissions practices are completely fair and lawful. Yale\u2019s admissions policies will not change as a result of the filing of this baseless lawsuit,\u201d Salovey wrote in the statement. \u201cWe look forward to defending these policies in court.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Indiana University law professor Kevin D. Brown said he believes the Justice Department sued Yale because it wants to argue against affirmative action before the Supreme Court.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cClearly what the plaintiffs are counting on is getting this up to the Supreme Court where, with a new Supreme Court now, it is a much more hostile Supreme Court with respect to affirmative action,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably right to believe that with the addition of [Judge Amy V. Coney Barrett] on the Supreme Court, you\u2019ll have a solid person majority against affirmative action.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Brown added that he believes President Donald J. Trump\u2019s nomination of Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court could very well result in the end of that policy, which has been in place since the 1960s and has survived multiple challenges at the highest level.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf Amy Coney Barrett is, in fact, confirmed \u2014 unless there\u2019s an effort to pack the court \u2014 it is likely that affirmative action will fall over the next two to three years,\u201d Brown said.</span></p> <p><span>University of New Mexico law professor Vinay Harpalani also said he thinks federal prosecutors had ambitions beyond just forcing Yale to change its admissions procedures.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think more broadly, the Trump administration\u2019s goal here is just to kind of send a public message to universities, to conservative interests that want to end affirmative action,\u201d Harpalani said.</span></p> <p><span>The Justice Department has also supported anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions in its ongoing lawsuit arguing that Harvard intentionally discriminates against Asian American applicants in its admissions program. The Department submitted an <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/27/doj-amicus-brief-admissions/\">amicus brief</a> in February calling for the First Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn a District Court ruling in Harvard\u2019s favor, and Dreiband presented against Harvard\u2019s policies last month during <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/17/sffa-harvard-appeal-hearing-day-one/\">oral arguments</a> in the appeals process.</span></p> <p><span>University of Maryland American Studies professor Janelle S. Wong wrote in an emailed statement that the lawsuit is an attempt to undermine affirmative action. Wong \u2014 who used to serve on the national board for the Association for Asian American Studies \u2014 added that she believes prosecutors did not genuinely intend to promote equality for Asian Americans as a whole.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Yale complaint also imposes a very strange definition of \u2018Asian American.\u2019 It states explicitly that for the purposes of the lawsuit, the Asian American category excludes Southeast Asian groups such as Cambodians and Hmong students,\u201d Wong wrote. \u201cHence, the Trump DOJ is manufacturing their own definition of our communities to suit their political agenda.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on those criticisms.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Benjamin L.

{"title": "What to Expect Next in the Harvard Admissions Suit | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Benjamin L. Fu", "body": "<p><span>Anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions challenged Harvard representatives in oral arguments before the First Circuit Court of Appeals <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/17/sffa-harvard-appeal-hearing-day-one/\">last month</a>.</span></p> <p><span>While legal experts believe the Court will not reach a decision for several months, that time period could coincide with both a new U.S. President and a new Supreme Court justice. President Donald J. Trump nominated Judge Amy V. Coney Barrett to the bench last month. While Coney Barrett has not previously ruled on race-conscious admissions, experts say her ascension could <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/29/barrett-nomination-admissions-lawsuit/\">threaten</a> precedents supporting affirmative action.</span></p> <p><span>District Court judge Allison D. Burroughs <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/2/admissions-suit-decision/\">ruled</a> last fall that Harvard does not intentionally discriminate against Asian American applicants, a decision SFFA <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/19/sffa-files-admissions-appeal-brief/\">appealed</a> in February. SFFA and Harvard presented <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/17/sffa-harvard-appeal-hearing-day-one/\">oral arguments</a> last month, during which the Department of Justice and NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund testified for the two sides.</span></p> <p><span>Here\u2019s what experts say those arguments mean, both for the future of SFFA\u2019s suit and for race-conscious admissions across the country.</span></p> <p><span>Scholars say SFFA has tried to paint alleged implicit bias against Asian Americans in Harvard\u2019s admissions process as a form of intentional discrimination, particularly in its most recent oral argument.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSFFA really emphasized the racial stereotyping and implicit bias of Asian Americans and actually argued, interestingly, that that\u2019s a form of intentional discrimination, which is unusual. Usually you think of implicit bias as unintentional,\u201d said University of New Mexico law professor Vinay Harpalani. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to latch on the appeal and go further to the First Circuit, potentially to the U.S. Supreme Court, and kind of use this theory to carry along the challenge to affirmative action.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Harpalani also pointed out the distinction between policies that discriminate against Asian Americans and affirmative action in service of racial diversity.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like their whole case is about taking this idea of discrimination against Asian Americans, vis-a-vis white Americans, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to promote that to actually challenge Grutter [v. Bollinger], to challenge race-conscious admissions to benefit African Americans and Latinos \u2014 which is a separate thing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mitchell J. Chang, a professor of education at the University of California, Los Angeles, said SFFA\u2019s \u201csmoking gun\u201d would show Asian American plaintiffs are being penalized in their qualitative measures.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that the question of whether or not Asian Americans are being discriminated against still stands, but how you frame it is the problem I have with SFFA,\u201d Chang said. \u201cThey\u2019re framing it as a result of race-conscious admissions that\u2019s supposed to benefit African Americans and other disadvantaged groups.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf this lawsuit is really in the interest of its Asian American plaintiffs, then why aren\u2019t we addressing the advantages that white applicants are having?\u201d he added.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard, by contrast, has relied on decades of case law supporting race-conscious admissions. Peter F. Lake \u201981, a Stetson University law professor, said such precedents are central to the University\u2019s case before the First Circuit.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c\u2018This isn\u2019t the time to overrule Fisher v. Texas, nor is it the right or job of a district or circuit to do that,\u2019\u201d he said, describing Harvard\u2019s stance. \u201cHarvard has been put through the test and has demonstrated that it has succeeded in a very thoughtful opinion.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The timeline for the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling remains unpredictable. Whenever that ruling comes down, though, experts said the losing side will likely again appeal the decision.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to see the First Circuit ruling in favor of SFFA,\u201d Harpalani said, citing the three appellate judges assigned to the case. \u201cJudges Lynch, Juan Torruella, and Howard, they\u2019re two Republican appointees and one Democratic appointee \u2014 one Reagan appointee, one Bush appointee, and one Clinton appointee. But that doesn\u2019t really mean much at this level.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Lake said he believes previous race discrimination cases in university admissions could hint at the future of SFFA\u2019s suit.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see the Circuit test some noncongruence with the District and remand the case for further proceedings or some kind of further judicial activity before that would be potentially ripe for final decision,\u201d said Lake. \u201cThat\u2019s been kind of the way these cases have gone in the past.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>SFFA has sued several universities over their admissions policies, meaning circuit courts could rule differently on the matter within the coming months. Lake said the First Circuit will have to be careful when timing its decision relative to the college application cycle.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019d be a heck of a thing to get a decision from the First Circuit in May that tells you what you did in April, in March was unlawful,\u201d said Lake. \u201cIf that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed, I think we\u2019d want to know that ahead of the admission season.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI would think the First Circuit will come out with an opinion in the spring some time,\u201d Harpalani said.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the case\u2019s unclear path forward, Lake said he believes anti-affirmative action advocates should not be overly optimistic about SFFA\u2019s appeal, even given Coney Barrett\u2019s nomination.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPeople will believe that with new justices, there may be a chance to overrule precedent. But the Supreme Court\u2019s credibility in a lot of ways \u2014 as well as its rule on American society \u2014 is bent on respecting stare decisis,\u201d Lake said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t overrule, because they have and they will in the future, but that\u2019s a pretty somber choice.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Harpalani, however, said race-conscious policies are safest if the Court does not take up any of SFFA\u2019s challenges.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe best chance for affirmative action to survive is if the Supreme Court does not grant cert,\u201d Harpalani said. \u201cIf [the Trump administration] really wants to strike down affirmative action now, they\u2019ll grant cert and the justices are there to do it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Several experts said they believe the Department of Justice\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/27/doj-amicus-brief-admissions/\">support</a> for SFFA in the lawsuit and its concurrent investigations into race-based admissions at other universities have political motives.</span></p> <p><span>Chang cited the Justice Department\u2019s decision to sue Yale over its allegedly <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/8/16/doj-yale-admissions-harvard-impact/\">discriminatory</a> admissions policies last week, for example.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis was the first time [the DOJ] came out so strongly against a particular institution and basically told them to suspend it,\u201d Chang said. \u201cIt\u2019s an administration that is trying to signal their stance on race-consciousness leading into the elections.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p> <p><span>University of Southern California education professor Tatiana Melguizo said she worries an end to affirmative action nationwide would mirror the same negative effects that Black and Latino students have faced in California since the state\u2019s 1996 ban of the practice.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAs soon as a Proposition 209 stopped, you could see a substantial decrease in the acceptance of Latinos and African Americans,\u201d Melguizo said. \u201cThat had a snowball effect because the students were receiving some sort of signal that they were not welcome.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Melguizo cited economic studies Harvard presented against SFFA in its court cas,e which demonstrated the role of affirmative action in student outcomes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThese economists estimated the loss in earnings for the Latino population is in the millions of dollars because students could not get admission and then went to less-selective institutions,\u201d Melguizo said.</span></p> <p><span>Chang also referenced the drop in numbers of African American and Latino students in California following the removal of race-conscious admissions practices.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSFFA seemed to have conceded that point because the empirical evidence there is just overwhelming,\u201d Chang said. \u2018There is a really strong relationship and strong added value to attending a more racially diverse campus.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Describing this case as the biggest race discrimination lawsuit in higher education in recent years, Lake said he believes the implications of the case will extend far beyond Harvard\u2019s admissions program.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cInternational audiences are watching this as well because Harvard is a global presence,\u201d Lake said. \u201cThe implications for this case resonate globally.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><strong><em>Correction: October 13, 2020</em></strong></span></p> <p><span><em>A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Mitchell J.

Soon after his criticism, Harvard announced that it would not<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/23/harvard-coronavirus-not-accepting-cares-act/\"> \u201cseek or accept</a>\u201d the funds to which it was entitled.</span></p> <p><span>In July, shortly after Harvard announced its fall reopening plan, Trump called it <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/7/8/trump-harvard-coronavirus-fall-criticism/\">\"ridiculous\"</a> and said University administrators \u201cought to be ashamed of themselves\u201d for taking the easy way out.

Hess, the director of Education Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, made a similar assessment of the upcoming election.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cInstitutions which eagerly embrace one political party or one ideology tend to do very well when that party is in power and tend to have a very difficult relationship with the other party when it\u2019s in power,\u201d he said. \u201cInstitutions like Harvard have both institutionally and culturally made clear that they have very strong preferences in our ideological and political debates, which means they have a big stake in the outcome.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In a <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/3/faculty-support-warren-president/\">survey</a> by The Crimson in March, nearly 80 percent of Harvard\u2019s faculty self-identified as very liberal or liberal, and a plurality supported Sen. Elizabeth A. Warren (D-Mass.) in the presidential primaries.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond politics, a president and his administration wield significant power and influence over the day-to-day workings of higher education.</span></p> <p><span>Terry W. Hartle, the senior vice president for government relations at the American Council on Education, said the industry is \u201cinextricably bound up\u201d with the federal government, which will provide colleges and universities with about $100 billion in financial aid and $40 billion in research grants in 2020 alone.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThose two things taken together add up to a very substantial part of our enterprise, particularly for research universities like Harvard,\u201d Hartle said. \u201cThe activities that the institutions engage in wouldn\u2019t look anything like they do without substantial support of the federal government.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Hopkins also noted the ability of a presidential administration to impact campuses with its policies on issues, like immigration and Title IX, and its response to national and international circumstances, like the coronavirus pandemic.</span></p> <p><span>Thomas D. Parker \u201964, a fellow at the Institute for Higher Education Policy, wrote in an email to The Crimson that if Trump is reelected, the University will remain \u201ca target.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard, because of its preeminence in the field of higher education, will continue to be a primary target,\u201d Parker wrote. \u201cSoon the General Counsel\u2019s office will be even bigger than the Office of University Advancement.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>With the stakes of the election high for both Harvard and the nation, Bacow urged affiliates to the polls in an email on Oct. 7.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEach of us, whether eligible to vote or not, has a responsibility to affirm and uphold the ideals of democracy,\u201d Bacow wrote. \u201cThe Harvard we have come to know and love, to challenge and change, is a uniquely American institution.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOur strength depends, in many ways, on the strength of the union, and we must do our part to ensure that every person\u2019s voice is heard,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you are eligible, please register and vote.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Camille G.

{"title": "Why You Can Have Your Vote and Protest it Too | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Talia M. Blatt", "body": "<p><span>The man on the phone was aggressively blas\u00e9, as I suppose is wont for many millennials. But after hearing dozens of answering recordings, I began to feel like a machine myself, an automaton mechanically entering phone numbers and clicking buttons on a screen. I craved the sound of breathing; I was grateful even for hostility, because it meant a human was on the other side.</span></p> <p><span>The man confirmed that he supported the candidate I was phone banking for, but his tone suggested he couldn't care less whether this person won. He hesitated before telling me, \u201cJust so you know, I think you\u2019re wasting your time. Work at a food bank, or a homeless shelter, or tutor some underprivileged kids or something.\u201d Then he hung up.</span></p> <p><span>I didn\u2019t get a chance to respond, and I don\u2019t know what I would have said had he stayed on to hear my response.</span></p> <p><span>Feeling unsettled, I played out the argument in my shower later that evening. (Don\u2019t lie \u2014 you\u2019ve done this at least once.) The careless way he listed the things I ostensibly should be doing suggested he himself hadn\u2019t done any of them. I thought it was peak American male arrogance to be completely politically disengaged but feel comfortable expressing derision at someone else\u2019s civic efforts.</span></p> <p><span>Then for a while, I thought he might be right. At a food bank I could be completely confident that my efforts were fruitful: My labor would translate directly to more full bellies. If a candidate I spent hundreds of hours volunteering for lost, that time was arguably completely wasted.</span></p> <p><span>Youth voter turnout \u2014 or rather, the lack thereof \u2014 is routinely attributed to young people\u2019s indolence and apathy, not any specific ideology. But the man on the phone was the first of many young-ish people I spoke with this summer who expressed the belief that voting is not only ineffective but actively harmful, a charade that saps energy from radical and more material change. Cleaning steam from the mirror, I considered this argument.</span></p> <p><span>From the well-intentioned pleas of the <a href=\"https://voteschallenge.harvard.edu/\">Harvard Votes Challenge</a> to new features of social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, over the past few months we have been bombarded with a deafening, one-note urge to vote. But in this final voting sprint, I want to take a step back and really address criticisms of electoral politics.</span></p> <p><span>First, and most importantly, the anti-voting people I spoke with always assumed a zero-sum relationship between voting or campaigning and other forms of engagement. But this is a false trade-off: Personally, I\u2019ve found time to vote and campaign, protest and tutor; many of the folks I campaigned with are similarly engaged across the board.</span></p> <p><span>More broadly, this view of electoral politics as a kind of political dead-end dismisses the way voting often acts as the gateway to deeper civic engagement. As my friends vote for the first time, I have also witnessed them realize a greater political attentiveness and a desire to get involved in demonstrations, local organizations, and campaigns.</span></p> <p><span>Are there people whose only engagement with politics is the ballot they cast every four years in the presidential election? Absolutely. But we should encourage those people to participate more, not tell them that voting is pointless.</span></p> <p><span>Another argument that I heard often, especially from leftists, was that voting upholds oppressive systems, namely carceral capitalism, settler-colonialism, and the patriarchy.</span></p> <p><span>Those systems undeniably exist, and I\u2019m not so naive to think that voting could necessarily dismantle them. But voting in a system is not an endorsement of the system, especially if one is also active outside the system. I can call for prison abolition at a protest and vote for a candidate who at least opposes private prisons over one who doesn\u2019t.</span></p> <p><span>Anti-capitalists still purchase food through a capitalist market system. Their solution is not to starve: It is to try to obtain food in the least harmful way \u2014 be it vegetarianism, a co-op, sustainable farming \u2014 while protesting capitalism through direct action. Even if there is no ethical consumption, we consume in the best way we can while pushing for a new, more ethical system.</span></p> <p><span>The same should be true of voting. We can take to the streets, and create self-sufficient communities, but in the interim we have an obligation to make things just a little bit better by voting. The fact that so many are disenfranchised is even more reason to vote, to amplify a political voice that is unjustly muted. In other words, resistance shouldn\u2019t be limited to the ballot box, but it shouldn\u2019t have to reject the ballot box as an important mechanism of change either.</span></p> <p><span>I want to be absolutely clear: This is not a call to vote for Joe Biden, or to vote blue no matter who, or to use harm reduction as a blanket political calculus. There are people for whom voting is personally <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/10/181022150951.htm\">traumatic</a>; for example, some sexual assault survivors feel alienated in a presidential election where the two major candidates are accused of sexual misconduct. I am not suggesting that we create a political culture that shames people who choose not to vote.</span></p> <p><span>But dogmatic condemnations of all electoral politics engender apathy in the privileged, and convince people that their passivity is radical. We cannot encourage people to stop voting or campaigning right now with the hope that they choose to engage in more nebulous forms of making change.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, we should move towards a vision of political engagement that includes the ballot box and calls for revolution and abolition, a recognition of short term gains that does not abandon long term imagination.</span></p> <p><span><em>Talia M.

{"title": "What the Presidential Candidates Can Learn from Student Debaters | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>We can argue about who won the first presidential debate, but it\u2019s pretty clear who lost: America.</span></p> <p><span>People across the political spectrum and almost all undecided voters agreed: It was chaos. There were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/us/politics/trump-biden-undecided-voters.html\">741 aggressive interruptions</a> during the 90-minute debate, which featured spectacle and self-aggrandizement over facts and reasoning.</span></p> <p><span>In light of the overwhelming underperformance of the first presidential debate, and in anticipation of the final one, some have proposed setting new limits on speaking times and giving the moderator mic-muting privileges. Others suggest canceling future debates altogether.</span></p> <p><span>But what if we were to reimagine the presidential debate entirely?</span></p> <p><span>American political debate is often traced back to the debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas in the 1856 Illinois senate race, which were unmoderated and structured so that the first speaker spoke for 60 minutes and the second for 90, before the first had a final 30 minute rebuttal. The first presidential debate, however, did not occur until 1960.</span></p> <p><span>The first presidential debates featured no immediate commentary or post-event analysis. After TV stations finished broadcasting the events, they cut right back to regularly scheduled programming. The goal of the broadcast was to project \u201cthe living image of the Presidential candidate \u2014 how he looks, what he believes, what is his idea of America's future and its place in the world, and how he will exercise the power of the Presidency,\u201d and the series of four debates between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon was considered a resounding success due to a correlated increase in voter interest and turnout.</span></p> <p><span>One <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/586586?seq=1\">study</a> shows that presidential debates from 1976 to 1996 increased voter comprehension of candidate issue positions and personality-based characteristics.</span></p> <p><span>This year\u2019s political debates, by contrast, seem to hinge almost exclusively on entertainment and dogma with superficialities and soundbites (Did you see that fly?). With no live fact-checking and an immediate abundance of partisan hype, we\u2019re left with misleading claims and constant maneuvering. Debates are supposed to clarify positions, not obfuscate them, but a CBS poll <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-won-debate-first-presidential-biden-trump/\">found</a> that only 17 percent of viewers found the first presidential debate informative.</span></p> <p><span>So, should we cancel the presidential debates? No.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, we need to re-evaluate the purpose of political debate and find the procedural mechanisms that would best serve those ends.</span></p> <p><span>I propose political debate take a page from student debaters. Yes, it\u2019s time to go back to school.</span></p> <p><span>Student debating societies in America originated in the mid 1700s, centuries before the first presidential debate. There are many styles and formats of academic debate, but all emphasize students\u2019 \u201cbreadth, as well as depth, of knowledge [\u2026] quick thinking and logical, rigorous analysis,\u201d as the intercollegiate <a href=\"https://apda.online/about/\">American Parliamentary Debate Association</a> puts it. Student debaters are trained to actively respond to counter points \u2014 confront the facts, not sidestep or ignore them. They are held accountable for their incorrect and imprecise facts and cited methods. They are respectful, engage with ideas instead of people, and face repercussions for superfluous interruptions.</span></p> <p><span>Each time I\u2019ve witnessed a student debate, all parties have engaged courteously and come away more informed. One of my introductions to Harvard was the Harvard Political Union\u2019s Democrat-Republican Debate during our Visitas orientation week. Both sides had fiercely different stances on everything from healthcare to immigration. Still, they defended their claims with manners, logic, and evidence.</span></p> <p><span>So, here are some suggestions for the presidential debates:</span></p> <p><span>First, add more structure. Many high school and college debate formats exist, but all mandate specific intervals for speeches and cross-examination. Clearly define the timing and order of each round, and penalize candidates that improperly interrupt or consistently go overtime.</span></p> <p><span>Second, give moderators tools to maintain order. In student debate, the judge cuts off a debater if they go overtime. Often a literal alarm goes off. Ahead of the first debate, moderator Chris Wallace <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/business/media/chris-wallace-debate.html\">said</a> he intended to \u201cget [Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Donald J. Trump] to engage, to focus on the key issues, to give people at home a sense of \u2018why I want to vote for one versus the other.\u2019\u201d That was overshadowed by his other goal, \u201cto be as invisible as possible.\u201d Moderators should act like a judge on behalf of the public. By all means, let them cut the microphones or use a buzzer.</span></p> <p><span>Third, allow and expect candidates to challenge claims and address concerns brought up by their opponents. Debaters are expected to target and overcome \u201cpoints of clash,\u201d as well as use factual data backed up by solid methodology. We judge them on their own claim as much as their capacity to deal with their opponent\u2019s. In office, the president cannot just sidestep national challenges; let\u2019s require those who want the job to directly respond to their opponents\u2019 points during debates.</span></p> <p><span>To be sure, we should not hyperfixate on the assignment of winners and losers. As political spectators and voters, we should heed Cicero\u2019s advice in \u201cOn Duties\u201d: \u201cWe should consider as enemies those who take up arms against us, not those who want to protect the republic in the way each judges best.\u201d In this case, let us find a common enemy in flawed logic and faulty evidence.</span></p> <p><span>Debates must prioritize the integrity of truth. If we limit politicians\u2019 opportunities to fall back on ad hominem attacks and well-timed emotional stories, the voters watching won\u2019t be as embarrassed for their country. In the future, perhaps debates will feature live independent fact-checking or roleplay scenarios to test a candidate\u2019s ability and imagination to respond to an unexpected international crisis. But for now, we need to re-evaluate why we watch presidential debates, and what we expect out of them. Debates should highlight fact and reasoning, not enable hand waving and reality show behavior.</span></p> <p><span>Those vying for our country\u2019s highest office should look to student debaters for inspiration.</span></p> <p><span><em>Julie Heng \u201824 lives in Kirkland House.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The promise of \u201claw and order\u201d has been a key refrain of President Donald J. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. The Center for American Political Studies (CAPS) / Harris Poll has been asking voters which candidate they believe will bring this so-called law and order to America since June. In the September poll, for the first time, a slight majority of Americans said they believe President Trump is best suited for the task.</span></p> <p><span>From June through August, Democratic nominee Joe Biden led Trump, polling at about 54 percent on the question. For months, news outlets such as the New York Times and The Hill had highlighted Biden\u2019s success on this front, citing the Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll.</span></p> <p><span>In September, the tables turned. Shortly after the publication of the September CAPS/Harris poll results, which had Trump up 51 percent to Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s 49 percent, the conservative media outlets Fox News and The Washington Times reported on the poll for the first time.</span></p> <p><span>Fox News and The Washington Times published articles declaring that voters are \u201creceptive to President Trump\u2019s law and order messaging.\u201d The articles have generated serious traffic on their respective websites, raking in a combined 404 comments as of Oct. 10. However, the poll never directly asks respondents their view on either candidate\u2019s \u201claw and order messaging.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mark J. Penn \u201976, a visiting lecturer at Harvard University and leading pollster for the Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll, explains that Fox News\u2019s claim that poll results reflected a positive response to \u201claw and order\u201d messaging \u201cis not the full context of the story.\u201d \u201cLook, articles like this take things out of context,\u201d he continues. \u201cThey\u2019re written to make a political point. That\u2019s not the whole picture.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Fox News declined to comment for this article.</span></p> <p><span>Penn, a former Crimson news editor, believes that the correct analysis of the poll is that \u201cBLM and the police, frankly, have much better images than\u201d both Biden and Trump. The poll finds that 67 percent of respondents view the police either favorably or very favorably, and 51 percent of respondents view Black Lives Matter favorably or very favorably. In comparison, 44 percent and 48 percent of respondents had a favorable or somewhat favorable view of Trump and Biden, respectively.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t cooperate with that article,\u201d Penn says when asked about his thoughts on the Fox News story. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that people cherry pick [the poll] and use it to advance agendas.</span></p> <p><span>The Fox News article attributes the poll\u2019s findings simply to \u201cHarvard,\u201d and only cites CAPS / Harris Poll once in the story.</span></p> <p><span>Penn believes the misattribution was intended to suggest that \u201ceven people from Harvard think that the president has some advantage\u201d on the question of \u201claw and order.\u201d Penn plans to reach out to Fox News about the attribution of the poll to \u201cHarvard\u201d \u2014 \u201cbecause it\u2019s not,\u201d he emphasizes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to police every article written in the universe,\u201d Penn concedes. However, he says, journalists are especially prone to \u201ccherry pick\u201d findings to fit a desired narrative during a contentious election cycle such as this one. To combat this problem, Penn suggests readers should seek out the original survey whenever they come across news analysis of polling data.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good article,\u201d Penn says in sum. He says he understands that pollsters cannot fetter access to their findings from those who may construe it to advance partisan goals. \u201cDo they have the freedom to provide their interpretation? They do. In this case, I don\u2019t agree with it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>For Penn, the importance of polling lies not in confirming preconceived notions, but rather in grappling with the unknown. He says that our current political climate has \u201cbecome too \u2018gotcha,\u2019 and too negative, too partisan.\u201d Using polls to reinforce political footholds has only added to this polarization, he suggests.</span></p> <p><span>As a pollster, he is in the unique position of a neutral collector of data. He acknowledges that polls must be used for political purposes, but also hopes they are used to see \u201cwhat America really looks like.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Context, Penn says, is everything \u2014 pollsters and journalists alike have a responsibility to provide accurate, unbiased information to the public. \u201cWe have to be honest in what we do,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd we need journalists to do the same.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014 Magazine staff writer Garrett W.

In one high-profile case last year, federal officials <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/8/27/incoming-freshman-deported/\">deported a Harvard freshman</a> after finding allegedly anti-American social media posts on the student\u2019s feed; the student eventually made it to campus.</span></p> <p><span>Elliott said that Trump\u2019s pursuit of more restrictive visa policies is \u201cnot something that started with the pandemic.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think this is the result, and we see this in a variety of ways, of a fundamental policy position on part of the Trump administration that is opposed to immigration, really of any kind,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThat kind of an anti-immigration platform is one that the administration has advanced very aggressively and our international students and scholars have suffered, and Harvard has suffered, and all of American Higher Education has suffered.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Elliott could not provide any insight on international students' prospects of returning to campus for the spring semester, saying that the decision to bring more students back still remains uncertain and is left up to each individual school.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Elliott expressed his commitment to improving the remote experience for international students.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is on everybody\u2019s mind, I can guarantee you that,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cWe understand that there are places where we might be able to do better and certainly that\u2019s the goal that every school is to do the best we possibly can and address the needs of international students which, again, in some cases you pointed out, are really quite acute.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Kevin A.

Just three of 260 respondents to <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/3/faculty-support-warren-president/\">The Crimson\u2019s 2020 faculty survey</a> indicated that they support Trump.</span></p> <p><span>The Faculty Council on Wednesday also heard a report on the Harvard libraries\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/28/libraries-resume-borrow-direct/\">coronavirus measures</a> and received a virtual tour of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences\u2019 new Allston campus from SEAS Dean Francis J.

{"title": "Academia Has Everything to Lose in This Election | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>To the academic community, the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to restrict <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/us/politics/h1b-visas-foreign-workers-trump.html\">H-1B work visas</a> and<a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/25/2020-20845/establishing-a-fixed-time-period-of-admission-and-an-extension-of-stay-procedure-for-nonimmigrant\"> F and J visa stays</a> were alarming \u2014 but not surprising.</span></p> <p><span>By now, we are<a href=\"https://harvardelr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/08/43.2-Lin.pdf\"> well aware</a> of the Trump administration\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02800-9\"> systematic opposition and denial</a> of scientific investigation.<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/trumps-science-health-budget/519768/\"> Slashing funding</a>,<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/c5cbe2bb3160af9054a1ea5249fff091\"> marginalizing experts</a>, and<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/us-energy-agency-asked-scientists-to-scrub-references-to-climate-change-1.22513\"> suppressing certain research</a> have made a mockery of rational decision-making and leadership. A global pandemic has killed over 220,000 Americans, and nearly a third of us <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/17/conspiracy-theories-pandemic-trump-2020-election-coronavirus-326530\">believe in coronavirus conspiracies</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Yet even more damaging are the Trump administration\u2019s attacks not against science itself, but against its foundation: its people.</span></p> <p><span>The promise of American research rests on the contributions of immigrant and international trainees.<a href=\"https://cen.acs.org/careers/diversity/Science-US-built-immigrants-keep/97/i9\"> Roughly half of Ph.D.-level science workers</a> and<a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6500/120\"> postdoctoral researchers</a>, as well as more than a quarter of science and engineering faculty in the U.S. are immigrants. From<a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31222-8\"> groundbreaking discoveries and patents to Nobel Prizes</a> and<a href=\"https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/always-demand-economic-contributions-immigrant-scientists-and-engineers\"> job creation</a>, immigrants are essential drivers of American scientific innovation. And for decades, the promise of a thriving, global-focused research community has positioned the U.S. as a<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/17/world/science-engineering-downfall-us-scn-trnd/index.html\"> world leader</a> in science and engineering. \u201cIf someone has merits, this is the country where he/she will be recognized,\u201d said Dr. Taslim A. Al-Hilal, who was raised in Bangladesh and now works as an assistant professor at the University of Texas at El Paso\u2019s School of Pharmacy.</span></p> <p><span>But over the past four years, the situation has changed, and national politics are impossible to ignore. Donald Trump and his administration have clearly communicated that immigrants are no longer welcome, and life in America can no longer just be about the research.</span></p> <p><span>For new arrivals to the U.S., Trump\u2019s hateful rhetoric invokes fear and a sense of otherness in an already uncertain situation. Trump\u2019s<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-perpetuated-birther-movement-years/story?id=42138176\"> political rise began</a> when he falsely claimed Barack Obama was not an American and a Muslim, and therefore unfit to serve as President. While in office, he has denounced immigrants from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/1/11/16880750/trump-immigrants-shithole-countries-norway\">shithole countries</a>,\u201d demanded that women of color in Congress \u201c<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/14/trump-tells-congresswomen-go-back-counties-they-came/1728253001/\">go back</a>\u201d to the \u201ccrime infested places from which they came,\u201d and implicitly supported a<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21313021/trump-white-nationalism-supremacy-miller-bannon-immigration\"> white nationalist movement</a>. Trump\u2019s verbal harassment targeted at Muslim, Latinx, and Black immigrants in particular inspire<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/09/racists-us-muslims-donald-trump-victory\"> legitimate concerns</a> for<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/latino-i-no-longer-feel-safe-trump-s-america-so-ncna1075191\"> physical safety</a>.</span></p> <p><span>This rhetoric has translated into<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/10/opinion/sunday/trump-immigration-child-separations.html\"> harmful policy</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/us-immigration-system-changes-trump-presidency\">over 400 executive actions</a> passed on immigration. This year, H-1B visas <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/25/science-is-better-when-we-open-our-doors-immigrants/\">were frozen</a> and the Muslim-focused \u201c<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/06/trump-travel-muslim-ban-separated-iranian-families-have-self-isolation-for-years/\">travel ban</a>\u201d was<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/us/politics/trump-travel-ban.html\"> expanded</a>. Even with valid documents, foreign-born researchers face increasing<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/04/25/716032871/visas-are-the-newest-weapon-in-u-s-china-rivalry\"> suspicion</a> and instability. This July, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement abruptly<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21365223/ice-international-students-college-coronavirus-covid-19-school-year\"> barred international students</a> taking online classes from remaining in the U.S. For students already facing a pandemic, this proclamation threatening deportation was deliberately cruel.</span></p> <p><span>Students forced out of the U.S. would lose laboratory and educational resources, and face disruptions to housing, healthcare, and teaching. Unsurprisingly, the uncertainty caused by this order was a source of major anxiety \u2014 just the latest Trump administration action with significant psychological and material consequences for international students. Although later rescinded, the order made clear that the Trump administration will continually probe the boundaries for<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/10/8/21507407/trump-immigration-debate-2020-biden-pence-harris\"> targeting immigrants</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Altogether, these words and policies have had their intended effect: Accosted by vicious policies, anxious about racist violence, and cut off from their families, foreign-born researchers feel more unwelcome, unsafe, and unable to plan for the future than ever. \u201cThe last 4 years have been absolutely exhausting. Each day you wake up wondering if the next policy decision will impact you,\u201d wrote Dr. Ana M. Porras, a Colombian-born assistant professor in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Florida. \u201cI do feel constant anxiety and it often distracts me from doing my research.\u201d Other scholars question how to envision career plans even one or two years ahead, scared that Trump\u2019s possible re-election might result in their having to return to their home countries.</span></p> <p><span>The numbers reflect these feelings. Between 2015 and 2018, international student enrollment in U.S. universities<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2019/11/19/new-international-student-enrollment-in-us-has-fallen-10-since-2015/#3fd8c41e1ae9\"> dropped over 10 percent</a>; international students who enrolled elsewhere listed the<a href=\"https://educationdata.org/international-student-enrollment-statistics\"> social and political environment</a> as one of their top reasons. Concurrently, the U.S.\u2019 relative research output has<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01231-w\"> shrunk</a>. Trends indicate a<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2018/10/01/americas-international-image-continues-to-suffer/\"> profound loss of international confidence</a> in the U.S. worldwide, eroding its solid research foundation.</span></p> <p><span>President Trump\u2019s policies have been painted as a \u201cwar on science,\u201d but this title is insufficient: Trump has attacked not only science but also its people \u2014 its humanity. By excluding immigrants and international students, and devaluing their lives and safety, his administration harms our community.</span></p> <p><span>What can we, as academics, do about this? We can<a href=\"https://www.ilcm.org/latest-news/five-things-you-can-do-to-support-immigrants-and-refugees/\"> begin by learning</a>: understanding immigrants\u2019 stories and their positive impacts on American science, as well as the shifting policy landscape. Informed and motivated, we can contact our representatives, aid organizations involved in<a href=\"https://www.aclu-wa.org/pages/5-things-you-can-do-fight-immigrant-families\"> immigration justice</a>, and speak out, proudly and vocally, both in support of international researchers and against the administration bent on ending them. We can vote for a candidate whose policies<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02786-4\"> explicitly support science and scientists</a>. In particular, professors have a responsibility to defend the individuals whose contributions have built their careers.</span></p> <p><span>It is time to demonstrate our respect for our immigrant colleagues through voice and action, and preserve science\u2019s humanity.</span></p> <p><span><em>Alex J.

Goodman", "body": "<p><span>United States Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) reiterated his support for exploring the expansion of the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday at a youth voter town hall hosted by the Boston Intercollegiate Government.</span></p> <p><span>Markey, who <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/2/markey-defeats-kennedy/\">defeated U.S. Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) last month</a> after a contentious Democratic primary squabble, has been one of the more vocal supporters of exploring court packing if conservative nominee Amy Coney Barrett is appointed in the coming weeks. His stance comes as Democratic presidential nominee Joseph R. Biden Jr. has tiptoed around taking a stand on such a proposal.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy feeling is that if they do this \u2014 and I\u2019m going to fight it with every political fiber in my body over this next week \u2014 that it\u2019s going to be imperative, next year, for us to repeal the filibuster rule and to begin the discussion of the expansion of the Supreme Court,\u201d Markey said.</span></p> <p><span>Markey\u2019s GOP opponent, lawyer Kevin O\u2019Connor \u2014 who spoke after him in the second half of the town hall \u2014 said the idea is a \u201cfool\u2019s errand.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cCourt packing has been widely regarded as a terrible idea,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a bad idea because what it does is it creates the foreseeable and inevitable consequence that each time one party is in party, it will pack the court.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Markey said Democrats \u201cjust can\u2019t allow\u201d the GOP \u201cto get away with\u201d appointing Barrett mere days before the election after Senate Republicans blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s appointment of Merrick B. Garland \u201974 in 2016 on the grounds that it was too close to an election.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Republicans are flat out lying,\u201d Markey said. \u201cThey\u2019re just flat out lying with what they said they were going to do in 2016. And it was just to steal a Supreme Court seat, which is what they did. They lied.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNow, if they were consistent this year and they did not try to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, that would be different,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this is just hypocrisy on stilts. I mean, it\u2019s an absolute heist of the Supreme Court that they\u2019re trying to engage in.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>O\u2019Connor did indicate he would be open to imposing a mandatory retirement age of 75 for justices in order to provide \u201cgreater predictability and a sense that judges will be leaving at the end of a foreseeable time period.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The two also differed on two issues that Markey said requires an expanded court to protect: health care and the environment.</span></p> <p><span>O\u2019Connor, a supporter of President Donald J. Trump who faces long odds in November, said Markey \u201chas become pretty good at taking hard-line positions that are not even in the mainstream of the Democratic Party,\u201d pointing to his support for the Green New Deal, which he co-sponsored with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt would bankrupt our country and your futures,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not feasible because it\u2019s entirely based on renewable energy, and we don\u2019t have the storage capacity right now to achieve that.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat we need to do is to harness our innovative capacity to develop the technologies that will bring us to a carbon-neutral level, and I think we can do it by 2050,\u201d he added.</span></p> <p><span>Markey, who has served in Washington since 1976, has made the Green New Deal a cornerstone of his campaign, which helped him to garner the support of Massachusetts\u2019 energized progressive wing in his primary race with Kennedy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you believe in climate change, and you want to do something about it, we\u2019re going to have to change the court if they continue on this reckless pathway that they have taken us over this last month with Amy Coney Barrett,\u201d Markey said. \u201cBut the same thing is true if you believe that everyone is entitled to health care.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>O\u2019Connor expressed opposition to the Affordable Care Act, first passed in 2010, calling it \u201ca one-size-fits-all system that has failed, by all accounts.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe want to have coverage rooted in private providers,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Markey pointed to protecting Obamacare as a central motivation for his opposition to Barrett.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFor millions of families across our country, it will be a disaster if they vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Markey said of the Supreme Court.</span></p> <p><span>Calling this election \u201cour own 1932,\u201d Markey called on young people to seek out organizing opportunities on campuses.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA re-election of Trump is like a death sentence to the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a perversion of science and democracy.

{"title": "A Value Proposition | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Not getting a job, Kim Nguyen \u201921 tells herself, doesn\u2019t make you a bad person.</span></p> <p><span>By the time we speak in late October, recruiting season is coming to a close. The leaves in Cambridge have shifted from green to red, but most members of the class of 2021 haven\u2019t witnessed their last Harvard autumn firsthand. They\u2019re at home in their childhood bedrooms, or renting an apartment with friends. Meanwhile, marathons of interviews have passed, and job offers have been made.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen I get rejected from things, sometimes I let that affect how I view myself,\u201d Nguyen says. \u201cBecause if you don\u2019t have a job, and you have no idea what you\u2019re doing after college, that\u2019s sad.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>When Nguyen began the recruiting process, she thought she had a good sense of what to expect: emailing in some resumes, answering \u201cStat 110\u201d-esque questions, and mostly \u201cwinging the interviews.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Nguyen plans to eventually attend graduate school to study math, because above all, she appreciates when \u201cpeople engage in a problem-solving process, and find a cool solution cool.\u201d But right now, she\u2019s looking to work for a few years in quantitative finance. She\u2019s interested in \u201cslightly tech-y, nerdy, math-y places\u201d \u2014 companies that care more about problem-solving, than just \u201c[changing a] parameter, and suddenly, [making] a ton more money.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAnd I kind of just want to have something that\u2019s enough for me to pay rent and eat food,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd also enjoy my job enough.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Among her friends who\u2019d done recruiting in previous years, she has witnessed an arduous \u2014 yet \u201ckind of fun\u201d \u2014 process. At Harvard, the recruiting process is dominated by the finance, consulting, and tech industries, and the main thrust of the hiring process takes place in August, September, and October.</span></p> <p><span>The first aspect of Nguyen\u2019s recruiting process that differed from expectation was her summer internship.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy internship last summer was completely virtual. I\u2019m a person who, if someone\u2019s not watching me, people would think I just disappear,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to make it a point of telling my manager how much I work every day, and that was just really weird.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Nguyen didn\u2019t end up getting a return offer from the company she interned for. This news was frustrating: She now had to enter into a shaky job market without an option to fall back on. She says that while she doesn\u2019t know if she would have gotten the internship in a \u201cnormal\u201d year, the \u201cfactor of [it being a] virtual internship was a lot weirder than a not-virtual internship.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And so, Nguyen \u2014 alongside many of her classmates \u2014 embarked on a journey in virtual recruiting.</span></p> <p><span>At Harvard College, a majority of students participate in the recruiting process for the finance, technology, and consulting industries; in 2020, 63 percent of the graduating class reported entering one of these three fields in The Crimson\u2019s Exit Survey.</span></p> <p><span>The vast majority of college students in the United States graduate without a clear plan; it takes the average college student three to six months to find a job after graduation. At Harvard, by contrast, it isn\u2019t uncommon to know your future place of employment months in advance.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNo matter who you are, if you come to Harvard, you\u2019re privileged. You have these opportunities to talk to firms that will only talk to Harvard students or Yale students, such as BCG,\u201d Joshua H. Berry \u201921 says. Berry, a former Crimson business associate, says that the major consulting firms simply don\u2019t visit the campuses of his friends who attend state schools in New York. \u201cWe\u2019re very lucky in that even during COVID-19, these consulting companies are still coming to campus,\u201d he adds.</span></p> <p><span>Berry believes Harvard makes its students an implicit \u201cpromise\u201d: \u201cIf you come to our school, we promise you that you\u2019ll have a great education, and that with this education, you\u2019ll be able to get almost any job you want,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Put differently, he feels that Harvard promotes the idea that by attending the school, students will be able to sidestep the uncertainty and discomfort that many other students face once they graduate college and enter the job market.</span></p> <p><span>This promise was never accessible to all students: Even with the efforts of the Office of Career Services (OCS) and the Center for Public Service and Engaged Scholarship to level the playing field, the Harvard employment landscape inevitably privileges certain students over others. And the pandemic has further circumscribed the University\u2019s ability to uphold its end of the bargain. When the tech, finance, and consulting industries are put under pressure, the playing field becomes even less equitable, hurting those without family connections, social privilege, and advanced pre-professional experience.</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard \u201cpromise\u201d was never available to everyone, but the pandemic in many ways has shattered that notion.</span></p> <p><span>Akanksha D. Sah \u201921, the president of Harvard Student Agencies, always wanted to work in the public sector.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI actually knew that I wanted to go into child advocacy since I was, well, a child,\u201d she says, motivated by an interest in resolving \u201csome of the inefficiencies\u201d of the foster care system. While she believes she could make a much higher salary by entering a more lucrative industry \u2014 as many of her peers at HSA elect to do \u2014 the lower pay is worth it to her.</span></p> <p><span>The pandemic has made the choice harder, though.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe went from having room and board paid for and covered by Harvard through financial aid to, all of a sudden, I\u2019m paying my own rent, I buy my own groceries, at a time when I had been planning on saving all of my income,\u201d she says.</span></p> <p><span>Students are \u201ctrying to figure out whether it\u2019s even financially possible to go into the public sector,\u201d she continues. \u201cBut if you can\u2019t afford to do it, you just can\u2019t afford to do it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>While Sah herself has not been discouraged from pursuing a career in public service, her situation illuminates how finances can pressure students to pursue certain careers over others.</span></p> <p><span>One Harvard office that is attempting to open students up to public service careers, in spite of those financial pressures, is the Center for Public Service and Engaged Scholarship.</span></p> <p><span>The Center seeks to foster student interest in public service careers \u2014 but often finding opportunities that are \u201cfinancially competitive for students\u201d poses a major challenge, says Travis A. Lovett, the Assistant Dean of Civic Engagement and Service at the Center. The steep salaries offered by private sector industries that recruit on campus heighten that challenge.</span></p> <p><span>Lovett says that the Center actively works to level the financial playing field, however, by helping to fund public service internships. It also organizes the \u201cPublic Interested Conference\u201d each February where \u201cstudents can ask alumni directly how they were able to survive in New York City on a $40,000 salary.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But to pose a viable alternative to the finance, consulting, and tech industries, the Center has to compete with and accommodate the schedules of their recruiting processes. The majority of public service jobs do not participate in seasonal recruiting, instead hiring \u201cwith a just-in-time recruiting mindset,\u201d as Lovett calls it, meaning that they fill positions as they become available or they receive more funds.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe try to be as proactive as we can, but we know that it is a much different hiring timeline than McKinsey, or Goldman Sachs, [who come] to campus in September,\u201d Lovett says. He cites this schedule as one reason the Center created Public Service Recruiting Day, an October event where seniors can interview one-on-one with what the Center\u2019s website describes as \u201chigh-performing public sector organizations.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that folks have a very clear understanding of what it means to be a doctor or a lawyer or engineer,\u201d says Alysha J. Williams \u201914, a Program Director at the Center. \u201cBut when you think you want to go into public service, it can be hard for students to visualize what that looks like.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Last year, Joshua A. Berry \u201921 was sitting in the Mather dining hall preparing for an onslaught of consulting interviews. He wasn\u2019t alone: he and his friends were learning the tips and tricks of the trade, and soothing nerves.</span></p> <p><span>This kind of interview preparation is a must, especially with consulting, according to Katie C. Cao \u201921. Students call it \u201ccasing,\u201d a skill Cao claims is much easier to develop on campus.</span></p> <p><span>Casing is a test of business acumen and reasoning \u2014 it measures your ability to think critically about common questions consulting firms may tackle. Cao says that it\u2019s not unusual to run through more than 35 practice case interviews before the first official interview.</span></p> <p><span>On campus, Cao could knock out some of that preparation by going to a dining hall and running through cases with a friend over dinner or asking an upperclassmen already hired at a desired company for help.</span></p> <p><span>But Berry laments, \u201c[There\u2019s] no longer club meetings where you can gather together and be like, \u2018Let's meet in the D-Hall and do case interviewing together now.\u2019 It's [now] like, \u2018Here are these resources online.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The virtual format has extinguished the social aspect of interview preparation \u2014 the part that makes such arduous work bearable, enjoyable, and accessible. \u201cAnd that's really tough,\u201d Berry notes. \u201cYou need this coaching for these interviews. Consulting and finance interviews require a lot of mock interviews you do with friends before you're successful and get the job.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>At home, it\u2019s not as easy to ask a tutor for advice or seek mentorship from older students. It\u2019s far more difficult to prepare, especially \u201cif your parents [aren\u2019t] familiar with or [don\u2019t] speak the language and [can\u2019t] prepare you, or you just [don\u2019t] know a lot of people in the field to do case interviews with,\u201d Cao notes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt can be a little bit chaotic to make that time for yourself and commit that many hours to just interview prep when a lot of people have other pressing, immediate responsibilities,\u201d she says.</span></p> <p><span>Dhruv Gupta \u201920 warns of the added disadvantage for students who don\u2019t have secure home environments or even a neutral video call background.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFolks who don\u2019t understand it get peeved by it. When you\u2019re on a Zoom call and there\u2019s someone with background noise because they can\u2019t help it, it reflects poorly on them,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that happen in real time where people have bad conversations or bad outcomes because of the situations that they\u2019re in.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He adds that the privilege of technological and home life reliability holds a particular level of importance in several job sectors. \u201cIn this world of startups, impressions matter,\u201d he emphasizes. A high-quality webcam and good lighting take utmost importance in startup culture \u201cwhere the only thing you\u2019re selling is impressions,\u201d Gupta says.</span></p> <p><span>Caleb A. Ren \u201921 also notes that some groups of people have had an easier time adapting to virtual recruiting than others.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThose who have barriers to being able to do work, either because of their home situation, or because it\u2019s fucking hard to just sit down, do work at your computer for hours on end without friends around, or to live with your parents,\u201d Ren says. \u201cThat\u2019s hard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Jadyn K. Bryden \u201921 \u2014 the current chief strategy officer of Harvard Student Agencies \u2014 says she feels lucky that she secured a job before the pandemic, especially in light of the COVID-19\u2019s disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. \u201cAs a Black woman, I see a lot of people in the Black community from home being negatively affected by COVID,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to witness my family members have to put their lives at risk [at in-person jobs] in ways that other people didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you\u2019re a student of color, how can you expect to do recruiting with a clear head, when this past summer exposed the systematic racism in this country?\u201d Berry asks. \u201cHow do you expect that student to be able to put in the time to study for consulting case interviews? How would you expect them to study technicals for a coding interview?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Ren comments that the expectation that students continue with school and the job process as if all is normal, coupled with the boundary of accessibility at these companies,\u201cis just a subtle way of reinforcing, systemic barriers that are very much tied with factors such as socioeconomic class, race, gender.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s just not equitable,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>In September, the Harvard Office of Career Services hosted a career fair unlike any before it. Instead of the typical setting \u2014 the SOCH buzzing with frenetic energy, brochures and resumes scattered across tables \u2014 each company held separate information sessions using a variety of video conferencing platforms.</span></p> <p><span>In the Facebook Q&amp;A session, a single recruiter\u2019s face spanned the whole screen as a slew of anonymous questions appeared in the chat box. In most other information sessions, few students turned on their cameras, and the ones who did were dressed more casual than business. The chimes of Zoom exits sounded louder than usual.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe were really good at pivoting,\u201d says Robin E. Mount, OCS\u2019s director, of her office\u2019s transition to remote services. \u201cWe didn\u2019t drop the ball on anything.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>From its experience hosting events during winter break and summer vacation and providing services for Harvard Extension School students, OCS felt well-equipped to hold offerings remotely. But a career fair was \u201ca very different product,\u201d Mount says.</span></p> <p><span>During the first OCS career fair of the year, Ren attended multiple information sessions at once, since many companies had signed up for the same time slot. \u201cAt one point, I had Zoom open in my browser, Zoom open on my desktop, Google Hangouts on my phone. And they\u2019re all going at once,\u201d he says. \u201cOh, and Teams \u2014 Teams going on in the browser,\u201d Ren adds after a moment of recollection. Then, his computer crashed.</span></p> <p><span>Ren, who is pursuing a job in tech, had many different employers\u2019 information sessions to attend. For students interested in industries beyond tech, consulting, or finance, this isn\u2019t always the case.</span></p> <p><span>On OCS\u2019s website, on a page explaining their \u201crecruiting program,\u201d the Office answers a question that some ask about Harvard\u2019s post-grad employment landscape: \u201cWhy is there so much Finance and Consulting?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Associate Director of OCS Deb Carroll explains that such companies are simply most interested in actively recruiting \u201cHarvard talent\u201d \u2014 these employers seek out Harvard students and students from other elite schools. There are jobs elsewhere, she explains, but Harvard students have to actively look for them.</span></p> <p><span>Usually, when employers invest in new recruits, they hope that they will commit to the company. Harvard students don\u2019t tend to do this \u2014 \u201cafter they get trained, [students] up and move to a different city and quit [their] job,\u201d Mount explains.</span></p> <p><span>Within the finance, consulting, and techn industries, firms \u201chave figured out how they can use entry-level talent and replenish it every year,\u201d she continues. \u201cHarvard students and these industries have figured out a mutually beneficial relationship \u2014 Harvard students get lucrative jobs right after graduation, and companies get a consistent stream of \u2018Harvard talent.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mount recalls how a Harvard alumnus at Boeing told her why she didn\u2019t recruit from Harvard: \u201c\u2018We\u2019re not going to come recruit at Harvard because Harvard students don\u2019t have the patience,\u2019\u201d Mount remembers her saying. \u201c\u2018It takes ten years to build an airplane, and after a couple of years, they just want to go and do something else.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Students notice the resulting skew toward the finance, tech, and consulting industries. Justin J. Hancock \u201921, who hopes to join the <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/4/18/those-who-can-do-teach/\">Harvard Teacher Fellows Program</a> with the Harvard Graduate School of Education and eventually become a math teacher, says that he\u2019s \u201cnot a huge fan of OCS.\u201d Justin recognizes that while \u201cthey try to provide a lot of resources,\u201d he also gets the impression that they show preferential treatment towards students interested in the three industries.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOne thing that I\u2019ve noticed is they tend to schedule education things in the middle of the day, when I have class,\u201d Hancock says. \u201cWhile they have a decent number of education events every year, I usually can\u2019t make it to any of them. And then I look at consulting events, and they\u2019re in the evening.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Christina Yee \u201921 has found similar issues as she pursues a career in design or creative consulting. Like Hancock, Yee says that while the September influx of OCS emails don\u2019t go unnoticed. \u201cI don\u2019t really see companies that I\u2019m interested in recruiting for on that list,\u201d Yee says.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard students have also created their own avenues for professional development and employment opportunities outside of OCS, in the form of the college\u2019s many pre-professional organizations. They often hold their own events independent from OCS to help their members secure jobs or opportunities, and train their members in soft and hard skills to build their resumes.</span></p> <p><span>Bryden says she secured her current and post-graduation job as the Vice President of the venture capitalism firm Xfund with the help of HSA board member Patrick S. Chung \u201996.</span></p> <p><span>This isn\u2019t to say that Bryden exclusively credits her career trajectory to HSA. \u201cOCS [was] a vital source in helping me to be the professional I am today,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember when I was younger in my career at Harvard, I went to OCS to get my resume reviewed, I learned about interviewing techniques, and all that stuff stays with you. I figured out what I should wear to an interview. That\u2019s not obvious stuff.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mount says that OCS tries to ensure that all Harvard students are given the chance to graduate having learned the ins and outs of the recruiting process \u2014 regardless of socioeconomic background. From hosting lunches for Fall Clean-Up participants to working with \u201cidentity-based student groups,\u201d OCS tries to reach freshmen as early as possible to \u201clower the barriers of entry to our office.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019ve run in this very fine dilemma where we don\u2019t want to [look] like we\u2019re pushing people into certain areas,\u201d she says, referencing OCS\u2019s abundant resources for finance, tech, and consulting. \u201cBut we also don\u2019t want people not to know about them and miss the opportunity to choose to do that.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Londoner Nicolas Weninger \u201920 had all but secured his position at a startup in Boston. \u201cI classified it as an anticipated understanding, at least from my end, that I\u2019d join them full time,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>When the pandemic hit, Weninger was told that the startup was \u201con a hiring freeze and [wasn\u2019t] taking anyone new, including former interns,\u201d he recounts. \u201cIt was late March, and I was unemployed.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Losing your post-graduation job is never ideal. But for Weninger \u2014 and other international students in his position \u2014 losing his job started a countdown timer until he lost his right to work and reside in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>Most international students study in the U.S. with an F-1 visa. An F-1 visa provides a 60-day unemployment grace period following graduation. During these 60 days, students can apply for what is called the post-completion Optional Practical Training \u2014 which extends the grace period to 90 days.</span></p> <p><span>If students fail to find employment during this time, they can continue to work in the U.S. only by either obtaining a green card or by securing an H-1B visa \u2014 what Weninger calls a \u201ccrapshoot.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Dragos Bugai \u201920, a recent graduate from Moldova, laments how difficult it is to secure an H-1B visa. \u201cYou\u2019d have to get a company to sponsor you for an H-1B visa,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy is this hard? Well, the company has to put a huge amount of money on the line, we\u2019re talking like five figures \u2014 like a hundred thousand dollars, sometimes even more \u2014 to sponsor you for a visa.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen the company has to choose between you and some American guy or girl where the company doesn\u2019t need to suffer an expense, who are they going to choose?\u201d he asks.</span></p> <p><span>This past summer, Bugai found out that his OPT application had been rejected for a clerical reason just two days before the deadline to reapply.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou can only reapply [...] 60 days after you graduate,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have an application on their desk within those 60 days, then you can\u2019t apply for it. And you have to leave the U.S. immediately. And that\u2019s it with your work status.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>At the time, Bugai was living in Nantucket with a Harvard friend. He had two days to get a printed application onto the right desk in Arizona. He recalls that it took a concerted effort of friends across the country for him to get his application in on time.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe all made this big effort. And I managed to send it in,\u201d he says. Bugai\u2019s application was approved last week.</span></p> <p><span>But as Bugai mentions, even with approval to stay, an international student must compete for positions at companies that are generally more inclined to give the spot to their American peers.</span></p> <p><span>Recently, South African Paula A. Chappel \u201920 recalls, she was helping edit a friend\u2019s cover letter and noticed that the friend wrote that she was from an international city. Chappel commented: \u201cPlease don\u2019t put that in your cover letter. You want to act like you have no ties to your home country. You can stay [in the United States]. You don\u2019t want them to be like, \u2018International? Out!\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBeing an international [student] definitely changes companies\u2019 perceptions of you and whether they want to employ you, because they know that even if it\u2019s three years down the line, there\u2019s complications coming,\u201d Chappel explains. \u201cSome jobs are more fussy about that; some jobs just say, \u2018If you\u2019re international, don\u2019t apply.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>When asked about how OCS has been supporting international students, Mount sighs.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOh, it\u2019s just a very sad story,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s never easy to get a job as an international student, but when the economy is strong, Harvard students tend to be okay. And then a couple of years ago, way before the pandemic, we started to see this tightening up \u2014 a lot of it coming from the Trump administration.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Chappel, who has secured jobs at a private equity firm and a consulting firm, cannot help but feel grateful for how things worked out for her in the long run.</span></p> <p><span>Weninger also considers himself fortunate to have eventually received a job offer in San Francisco as an embedded systems engineer. He got the job after meeting a Harvard alum at a talk sponsored by the Harvard University Aeronautical Society.</span></p> <p><span>Bugai, however, was more apprehensive about sharing his story. He is still in Nantucket, Mass., working remotely on data cleaning jobs among other short term data science projects. He\u2019s also doing some tutoring on the side.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI was thinking whether [or not] I should interview because I felt shame that I failed as a Harvard student by not securing something right [after graduation],\u201d he says. He feels that he failed to \u201cfulfill this mandate that I was given of being successful right out of college.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBut then I realized that, hey, you know, times are what they are.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Berry worries for a certain kind of Harvard student from the class of 2021.</span></p> <p><span>He\u2019s worried for students who said to themselves upon arriving at college: \u201cHarvard is four years where I can really explore and find all my interests. And I don\u2019t even have to worry about finding a job because by the time I\u2019m a senior, the jobs are going to come to me, because I\u2019m a Harvard student.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The pandemic has disadvantaged those types of students, Berry fears, the students who \u201ctook Harvard as a sort of liberal arts education where [they decided] \u2018I don\u2019t join professional clubs, but I join a cappella, I joined The Crimson.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cCompanies are less willing to take risks on those students,\u201d Berry suggests. \u201cThere\u2019s less jobs overall. When companies do make hires, they probably don\u2019t want the student who did a cappella \u2014 [they\u2019re] probably looking for those hyper pre-professional students who knew from day one that they wanted to do consulting or finance.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Eli W. Russell \u201920 is one of those students. He hopes to go into television writing, and before the pandemic, he had imagined moving out to Los Angeles and working as an assistant. Now he lives at home, working for the Michigan Democratic Caucus, because \u201cpolitics is one of the few industries that\u2019s actually hiring.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>While Russell did not pursue a job in one of the so-called \u201crecruiting sectors,\u201d he did embrace the liberal arts promise \u2014 and ultimately graduated jobless. For a few months following graduation, he was unemployed and lived at home, working on his writing portfolio. While he did not expect to return home after graduation, he says he \u201cfeels very lucky his parents will house [him] and feed [him].\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Jasper D. C. Johnston \u201920, however, knew from day one that he wanted to do consulting.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy father does negotiation consulting,\u201d he says. \u201cIn high school, I got interested and involved in his work \u2014 I helped advise a number of his clients, and having that opportunity, obviously, is very helpful,\u201d he adds. \u201cFrom a young age, [it] just started to appeal to me.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Johnston credits his involvement with Harvard Undergraduate Consulting on Business and the Environment, a pre-professional \u201cconsulting strategy group,\u201d with helping him secure a job at McKinsey &amp; Company. \u201cA really tough decision\u201d amid the pandemic, he says, was choosing between accepting his job offer or beginning a Master\u2019s program at Oxford. (He has also been accepted at Harvard Law School via the Junior Deferral Program.) Johnston recognizes that he \u201cwas in a very privileged position of actually having these options and having them not fall through.\u201d He sighs. \u201cBut it was still tough.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>That Johnston and Russell\u2019s experiences could so starkly diverge calls into question the validity of the University\u2019s oft-touted \u201cliberal arts education\u201d \u2014 at least in the realm of post-graduate employment. Though the pandemic may have widened the gap between the students who pursue pre-professional clubs and those who join a cappella groups or The Crimson, it didn\u2019t create it. But many students, Berry suggests, had assumed that Harvard\u2019s implicit \u201cpromise\u201d had insulated them from its vicissitudes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe majority of Americans, the majority of people in this world, go to college to get a degree [and then] to get a job,\u201d Berry suggests. Harvard, he says, offers something more: the opportunity to receive the fullness of a liberal arts education \u2014 one where you can study the humanities or join an a capella group \u2014 and still get a good job after graduation.</span></p> <p><span>Now, just like everyone else, Harvard students may have to choose.</span></p> <p><span><em>\u2014 Staff writer Kevin Lin can be reached at kevin.lin@thecrimson.com.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>What does it mean to be a Republican in 2020?</span></p> <p><span>According to many in the Harvard Republican Club, the answer is very different than it was four years ago.</span></p> <p><span>Those part of the group in 2016 remember it as a community open to <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/5/27/commencement-2020-republicans/\">\u201canyone right of Marx.\u201d</a> Older members describe an emphasis on friendly, intellectual discussion and a legacy of female presidents and gender parity.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI would say I never felt not included,\u201d said Sapna V. Rampersaud \u201919, who joined the club her freshman year. Moderate and left-leaning people were welcome at meetings and events, she remembers. She \u201cnever noticed that there was any sort of tension related to difference in opinion.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This was the same year HRC <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/5/republican-club-not-support-trump/\">chose not to endorse Donald Trump</a>, after a club-wide poll of members revealed 80 percent weren\u2019t planning on voting for him.</span></p> <p><span>Last month, that same club held another vote on the current president \u2014 but this time it looked very different. HRC hosted a Zoom forum open to first-years and those who had attended previous meetings, but only the executive board was allowed to vote. According to several participants who spoke to Fifteen Minutes, the meeting was sparsely attended, and the majority of those present were board members.</span></p> <p><span>In the final vote, the club split along gendered lines: Two women who has served on the board were also the only two people to vote against a Trump endorsement. <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/30/harvard-republicans-endorse-trump/\">Reversing their 2016 stance</a>, HRC chose to endorse Donald J. Trump.</span></p> <p><span>No one outside the group seems to know the full composition of the club\u2019s voting board members. HRC\u2019s list of officers on The Hub, the College\u2019s student organization registry, names only four people. Postings on The Hub are rarely accurate, however, and interviews with board members suggested that HRC\u2019s leadership was much larger than just four students. Those interviewed declined to reveal the total number, so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly how many voted in favor of Trump.</span></p> <p><span>Several days after their Zoom forum, the club announced its decision to endorse the President in a written statement posted on their Facebook page, earning backlash from many within and outside of the Harvard conservative community. The statement itself received 49 comments, and many students took to Instagram to condemn the club\u2019s decision.</span></p> <p><span>So how did HRC go from denouncing Trump\u2019s \u201cracial slander\u201d as a \u201cthreat to the survival of the Republic\u201d in 2016, to lauding the president in 2020 as creating \u201cthe most prosperous and safe lives for Black Americans\u201d and \u201cpeace worldwide\u201d?</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard Republican Club has historically been a close-knit group. Grace K. Bannister \u201921, a member since her freshman year, fondly recalled a \u201cbig tent\u201d community where it was \u201ceasy to make friends\u201d and club members often got together in the Quincy House dining hall to \u201cjust hang out and talk.\u201d Bannister previously served as the club\u2019s Vice President of Socials, hoping to provide community and foster a better relationship with the Harvard Democrats Club, even leading a joint fundraiser.</span></p> <p><span>After 2016, however, Bannister could feel that \u201cbig tent\u201d community <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/5/27/commencement-2020-republicans/\">beginning to change</a>. She and other older members of HRC discussed a range of factors in the rise of a \u201cpro-Trump faction.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The first indicator that this faction was gaining power was the outcome of the club\u2019s 2017 leadership elections, which Bannister described as marked by \u201cHarvard snakery, to like, the millionth degree.\u201d Members leveled allegations of voter suppression, and after allying themselves with the John Adams Society, those in favor of Trump\u2019s presidency purportedly registered many people outside the club to vote in HRC board elections.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was the first time the Trumpy members tried to do a power grab,\u201d Bannister said, adding that many HRC members left over the internal politics and infighting. \u201cAfter that, there were so few members in the club that the board basically elected themselves for the next two years.\" HRC\u2019s current president, Wesley L. Donhauser \u201921, confirmed that his election as President was uncontested.</span></p> <p><span>Another, more simple potential explanation for the shifting attitude toward Trump was suggested by a former HRC president. \u201cWe really thought he was going to lose.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But following larger trends in the club and party as a whole, nearly every person interviewed independently cited the shift to a virtual community in light of the pandemic \u2014 a community centered around a contentious GroupMe \u2014 as a final tipping point. As Bannister put it, pro-Trump members were \u201ccoming out of the woodwork.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, HRC\u2019s group chat wasn\u2019t particularly active; older interviewees said that some would occasionally share an article and facilitate discussion. But at the beginning of quarantine, they saw a shift almost immediately.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cRight off the bat,\u201d one HRC board member said, a couple of people started \u201cdominating the dynamic of the GroupMe.\u201d She\u2019d been involved for three years, and though she said that historically \u201c[HRC] members all knew each other,\u201d many of the most vocal participants in the chat were now people she had never met. One was someone she\u2019d never known was a fellow board member, though he quickly became a \u201cloud, outspoken voice\u201d that she speculated \u201cmade people scared to share their opinions.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bannister similarly described the club\u2019s central group chat as being \u201chijacked by a few voices\u201d \u2014 many of whom she\u2019d never known in her four years in HRC. \u201cI think that a lot of people felt a lot more comfortable behind a screen saying things in support of Trump than they would to somebody's face on campus.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In one group chat conversation, a recently-graduated senior expressed criticism of Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett. He shared that he was a former \u201csingle issue voter on the matter of abortion,\u201d but doubted Barrett would actually overturn Roe v. Wade. It was more important to him that she would \u201cdo a lot of things I don\u2019t like to healthcare, voting rights, environmental protections, etc.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBrave of you to post in the lion\u2019s den,\u201d one person responded to him.</span></p> <p><span>Most other comments, however, were negative. One person dismissed his concerns about the way Barrett would rule as \u201cstraw man arguments,\u201d calling them \u201cassuming\u201d and \u201cdull.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Another member responded by directly tagging the Barrett critic in messages like, \u201cHow are you so dense\u201d and \u201cContraception is wack but y\u2019all ain\u2019t ready for that conversation.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>With fewer women in the group chat at the time, the men led the conversation. \u201cYour access to contraceptives is unrestricted,\u201d one joked, seeming to reference the fact that the writer concerned about abortion rights was a man. (All of the named commenters were men, as were eight of the ten participants in the conversation.)</span></p> <p><span>As the group chat grew louder and more \u201ccombative,\u201d in Bannister\u2019s words, many veteran members chose to mute the chat or leave entirely.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to respond, and I\u2019ve just been told I\u2019m stupid,\u201d said an HRC board member who spoke to Fifteen Minutes on the condition of anonymity. She now hopes to completely disaffiliate from the club. The loud voices were taking over, she explained. \u201cThey were destroying us.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>When Grace Bannister opened the Zoom link for HRC\u2019s endorsement forum, she wasn\u2019t particularly optimistic. Looking at the call\u2019s participants, she \u201calready knew what was going to happen.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>By the time the forum was advertised \u2014 over email and in the club\u2019s acrimonious group chat \u2014 many of the members who identified as moderate conservatives, like Austin B. Barclay \u201922, had already grown \u201cdisillusioned.\u201d Oluwatobi I. Ariyo \u201922, another former member, believed \u201cit was very purposely done that [the forum] wasn\u2019t as well publicized.\u201d Bannister agreed: \u201cHad this thing been better publicized and had people not been so upset with what was happening in the group chat, there would have been more turnout,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview on the endorsement, club President Wesley L. Donhauser \u201921 disputed their criticisms. He said the club held the forum because \u201cwe wanted to give everyone a chance to have their voice heard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But for the two people on the call whose \u201cvoices\u201d weren\u2019t pro-Trump, it wasn\u2019t quite that easy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was nerve-wracking to be one of the only people saying \u2018I don't believe this,\u2019 when everybody was just like echo-chambering themselves,\u201d Bannister recounted. It was the tenor of the conversation, however, that surprised her the most.</span></p> <p><span>At one point she remembered being told she should be ready to debate any argument she made. The personalities, she felt, had grown very \u201cTrumplike.\u201d \u201cPeople were in a fighting mood that night,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the group that I had joined as a freshman.\u201d When Bannister would begin speaking, she\u2019d get a lot of comments in the chat: Many called her a \u201cRINO\u201d (Republican In Name Only) or encouraged her to join the Harvard Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>If Bannister \u2014 a four-year member of the club, who worked for two Republican lawmakers and the Republican Governors\u2019 Association \u2014 isn\u2019t Republican enough, who is?</span></p> <p><span>The only other person who voted against the endorsement similarly described the meeting\u2019s climate as \u201cvicious.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt definitely was a bunch of guys ganging up on us,\u201d she said of the forum. \u201cIt felt very targeted.\u201d Despite her position on the executive board, she too was called a \u201cfake Republican.\u201d Notably, she remembered the messages seeking to \u201cshut down her opinions\u201d came from the Zoom chat, rather than direct verbal confrontation.</span></p> <p><span>When asked if HRC still held a spectrum of opinions, Donhauser answered there were \u201cquite a few\u201d members left in the club who disagreed with the endorsement.</span></p> <p><span>But the former board member thought differently: \u201cI think it\u2019s sealed that that\u2019s not the case.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In 2016, HRC\u2019s public statement announced a \u201crefusal\u201d to endorse Trump, describing him as a \u201cdangerous man,\u201d who was \u201cpoisoning our country and our children,\u201d and \u201ceschewing basic human decency.\u201d The words of these undergraduates reached CNN, NBC and the Washington Post.</span></p> <p><span>The statement\u2019s writers claim to be \u201cashamed\u201d of Trump and his \u201cracist slander.\u201d After the club denounced Trump, it saw at least 130 potential new members attend an introductory meeting, compared to only 3o during the year prior.</span></p> <p><span>By contrast, HRC\u2019s 2020 endorsement points out Trump\u2019s campaign promises to \u201cWin the Race to 5G and Establish a National High-Speed Wireless Internet Network,\u201d \u201cTo Continue to Lead the World in Access to the Cleanest Drinking Water and Cleanest Air,\u201d and to \u201cHold China Fully Accountable for Allowing the Virus to Spread around the World\u201d as critical components of the rationale behind their support of him.</span></p> <p><span>The statement\u2019s formal list of Trump\u2019s accomplishments included three sections: foreign policy, his work on trade, and a final section on \u201cBlack Americans,\u201d which drew the most criticism. \u201cIt is our sincere belief that the policies of the Republican party and President Trump would lead to the most prosperous and safe lives for Black Americans,\u201d the third heading read.</span></p> <p><span>Below that heading, however, the bulleted points hardly mentioned \u201cBlack Americans.\u201d Instead, they highlighted policies that would generate \u201cprivate capital investment for disadvantaged communities\u201d without explaining whether there exists a distinction between the categories of \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cdisadvantaged.\u201d A later point on criminal justice reform couched Trump\u2019s policies in colorblind rhetoric, praising a push toward \u201cequity for all Americans\u201d without mentioning a disparate racial impact.</span></p> <p><span>Within Harvard\u2019s conservative community, the statement was met with backlash.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that people who ideologically or morally disagree with the president were not involved,\u201d Barclay said, highlighting their list of cons as \u201cpaltry\u201d and \u201cabsurd.\u201d The statement\u2019s section on \u201cThe President\u2019s shortcomings\u201d made up only 11 percent of the overall word count.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI fail to understand how that was their list, unless they completely removed ideological dissent,\u201d he continued, arguing that support of Trump is now the club\u2019s standard.</span></p> <p><span>Who then, was involved? \u201cI think Wes just wrote it all on a Google Doc and posted it in the smaller GroupMe and said people were welcome to make suggestions by DMing him or commenting on the doc over a period of 24 hrs,\u201d a former board member familiar with the process wrote in a texted statement.</span></p> <p><span>Donhauser corroborated that account when asked for comment, saying he attempted to \u201caggregate\u201d club members\u2019 general feelings in writing the statement. \u201cAs President it is my job (for better or worse sometimes!) to handle media engagements,\u201d he wrote.</span></p> <p><span>After the statement was released, multiple members disaffiliated, claiming that the group no longer represented their values.</span></p> <p><span>Following the Zoom forum, one former board member still hoped that the statement\u2019s critique section could be \u201cpretty decent.\u201d But \u201cseeing the \u2018we think Trump is the best option for Black people\u2019\u201d section was the final straw, she recalled. She wanted to remove her name from everything associated with HRC; the current group no longer represents her views at all.</span></p> <p><span>She and other HRC members had \u201cdonated to Black Lives Matter\u201d and expressed \u201csolidarity\u201d on social media, she said. To her, these actions signaled politically that they acknowledged the existence of racism. But for other people in the group, she continued, \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018racism is fake.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>When asked to comment on concerns about racism within HRC, Donhauser responded that \u201cRacism is something that we take very seriously. It\u2019s something that exists and should be condemned at every corner.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Fifteen Minutes reached out to numerous other members of the group, including all known board members and affiliates who support the current president. None agreed to provide comment on their role in the vote or statement.</span></p> <p><span>On Facebook, there\u2019s only one comment on the first screenshot of the statement.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cdid you ask any black people LMAO.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Oluwatobi I. Ariyo \u201921 came into Harvard a proud conservative. His freshman year, Ariyo penned a widely-read opinion piece for The Crimson titled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/1/29/oluwatobi-from-lone-conservative/\">Cry from A Lone Conservative</a>.\u201d In it, he criticized an \u201cecho chamber culture where expression of differing opinions is met by hostility.\u201d Harvard, as he saw it, was a school with an \u201coverwhelming liberal majority\u201d where he felt \u201csilenced\u201d and \u201cmarginalized\u201d for speaking his mind as a conservative student.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview recently, Ariyo thought back to that op-ed. His former thesis \u2014 that liberal colleges are characterized by intolerance for differing perspectives \u2014 is a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/5/campus-reform-scrutiny/\">mantra that conservatives on college campuses really speak to</a>,\u201d he said. But now, he\u2019d say HRC is guilty of that same intolerance.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was interesting to see the club that I was in turn into the echo chamber we often denigrate.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As one of the club\u2019s few Black members, Ariyo described feeling an acute \u201clack of empathy\u201d for his lived experience. When he spoke up in the club\u2019s chat after the killing of George Floyd, he said his ideas were always \u201cshut down.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019d just be like: The numbers say this; Trump\u2019s not racist. The numbers say Black people are killed as much as white people per capita, so there\u2019s no racial problem in the police system. Full stop,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Ariyo eventually left the chat. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel comfortable being used almost as a token.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen I published my op-ed, I was getting all these comments from people in the club being like \u2018Oh that\u2019s amazing,\u2019\u201d Ariyo remembered. The same was true this past year, as he tried to start a conservative newspaper on campus. \u201cAnd then when I bring up something that makes me feel uncomfortable, it\u2019s like my opinion no longer matters.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As he reflected on his experiences in HRC, Ariyo made his mind up that this wasn\u2019t just a problem with one college Republican club. Rather, he said the tokenization he experienced was \u201cmore endemic of the party as a whole.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of optics in my opinion,\u201d he continued. \u201cMinority lives matter only as long as they stay in line.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Republican Party loves to showcase their few minority conservatives,\u201d he went on. At times, people were eager to hear what I had to say.\u201d Things were different, though when he spoke up after the death of George Floyd.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAll of a sudden, it\u2019s silent.

{"title": "Young Americans Can Boot Climate Deniers Out of Congress this Year | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As the election draws closer, I\u2019ve got one number on my mind: 114 climate deniers <a href=\"https://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/green/news/2019/01/28/172944/climate-deniers-116th-congress/\">sitting</a> in the United States House of Representatives.</span></p> <p><span>Young people alone have the power to oust 96 of them.</span></p> <p><span>Young Americans <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xgqymn/exclusive-poll-80-of-young-voters-think-global-warming-is-a-major-threat-to-life-as-we-know-it\">overwhelmingly care</a> about the environment. We\u2019re going to pay the price if today\u2019s leaders refuse to act aggressively against catastrophic climate change. Flipping those seats should be a top priority for young organizers, because although the presidential race gets most of our collective attention, it\u2019s actually up to Congress to enact the policies on climate change adaptation and mitigation that could save our planet. Young voters can play a crucial role in voting climate deniers out of office \u2014 but only if we vote, and vote all the way down the ballot.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, voter turnout among younger Americans drags miserably behind every other age group. After five years of living in extreme drought conditions in California, it was clear to me and my friends that climate action was on the ballot in 2016. I was crushed to watch half of eligible 18-29-year-olds <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html\">stay home</a> that November, America\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/201611\">second warmest</a> November month on record.</span></p> <p><span>In the 2018 midterms, a follow-up climate referendum, young voter turnout <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/04/behind-2018-united-states-midterm-election-turnout.html\">surged</a> 16 percentage points from the previous midterm election, when it stood at an embarrassing 20 percent; that energy was rewarded by aggressive legislation in Congress, including the Green New Deal.</span></p> <p><span>Now, climate change is back on the ballot in 2020 \u2014 just ask anyone in the San Francisco Bay Area, where an epic rash of wildfires is taking its toll, triggering more loss of life and livelihood, and producing another respiratory epidemic as we struggle to contain COVID-19.</span></p> <p><span>At the presidential level, climate voters have a clear champion: Joe Biden has the most progressive climate agenda of any major party nominee in American history. But is that platform, buried under the pageantry of the Democratic National Committee, enough to get climate-conscious young people to the polls? For all but the most politically engaged, I\u2019m not so sure.</span></p> <p><span>If we want down-ballot turnout in support of Congressional candidates who accept climate science, we need to stop relying on Biden\u2019s coattails and start telling a better story of how your vote can make a difference. Here\u2019s the message that young people need to hear to know that their vote will move the needle on climate action: Come November, 18-29-year-olds will constitute a large enough voting bloc to kick these climate deniers out of office.</span></p> <p><span>In 96 of the Congressional districts represented by a climate denier, the incumbent\u2019s 2018 margin of victory falls short of the number of 18-29-year-olds in the district, according to combined statistics from the <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/house-charts/2018-house-popular-vote-tracker\">Cook Political Report</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs\">U.S. Census Bureau</a>. In these target districts, a wave of youth turnout could prove decisive and send a sitting climate denier packing.</span></p> <p><span>And we don\u2019t need 100 percent turnout before young voters start making a difference \u2014 each marginal vote counts. If an additional two percent of 18-29-year-olds get fired up in each district and march to the polls, three climate-denying incumbents could lose their seat. If an additional 20 percent cast ballots, up to 23 climate deniers are underwater.</span></p> <p><span>And that\u2019s an attainable goal: According to the Institute of Politics\u2019 <a href=\"https://iop.harvard.edu/about/newsletter-press-release/harvard-youth-poll-election-2020\">Harvard Youth poll</a> released last month, 63 percent of young people reported that they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d vote in November, up more than 20 points from <a href=\"https://iop.harvard.edu/fall-2018-national-youth-poll\">this time</a> in 2018.</span></p> <p><span>As young voter turnout goes up, so too will the number of seats in play. A 50 percentage-point increase in turnout in each district could jeopardize the seats of a whopping 57 climate deniers \u2014 and all of this even before the additional voting power of adults 30-and-up tip the scale.</span></p> <p><span>It may seem a fool\u2019s errand to bring climate messaging to the center of mainstream get-out-the-vote efforts in this strange, strange year (although organizations like <a href=\"https://www.environmentalvoter.org/\">Environmental Voter Project</a> and <a href=\"https://nextgenamerica.org/\">NextGen America</a> are doing tremendous work to activate single-issue climate voters). But nothing happens in a vacuum. Climate policy and COVID-19 policy are inextricably linked: The unwillingness to accept scientific consensus on climate change is akin to the rejection of public health guidance on containing the pandemic.</span></p> <p><span>Likewise, young voters are acutely aware that climate justice is racial justice: Those of our generation who turned out in droves, to the street or in spirit, to protest systemic racism know that the burdens of climate change are disproportionately borne by communities of color.</span></p> <p><span>The stakes are high, and not voting is a vote against climate justice. Unless we make a concerted effort to mobilize young climate voters around Congressional elections, Joe Biden won\u2019t have the support to enact the climate agenda we need.</span></p> <p><span><em>Oliver S.

{"title": "Harvard Professors Discuss Role of Religion in the 2020 Election at Divinity School Lecture | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Emmy M. Cho", "body": "<p><span>Harvard professors discussed the evolving role of religion in the 2020 presidential election in a lecture hosted by the Divinity School Thursday.</span></p> <p><span>Moderator Catherine A. Brekus \u201985, a Divinity School professor who studies the history of religion in America, situated the conversation in a status quo moving to accommodate new religious trends, particularly the emergence of religious \u201cnones,\u201d or non-believers.</span></p> <p><span>American History professor James T. Kloppenberg and Visiting Professor in Religion and Political Culture E. J. Dionne spoke about newly emerging trends of highly Christian populations expressing their disappointment with President Donald J. Trump, some even going as far as casting the ballot for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cJoe Biden might actually win not only the Latino Catholic vote by a large margin, but he may actually pull off a victory in the white Catholic vote,\u201d Dionne said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s partly because of the same disillusionment with Trump that other groups are feeling.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Dionne mentioned growing discontent among conservative Catholic and Christian voters with the president\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He cited John Carr, founder and director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life and Georgetown University when explaining this rationale.</span></p> <p><span>Carr \u201cmade the point that if you are pro-life, it is not just about what happens before birth, it\u2019s not just about what happens in the womb,\u201d Dionne said. \u201cI am hearing this language, which is traditionally liberal-Catholic, liberal-Christian language, now coming from an awful lot of more conservative, anti-Trump Christians.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Brekus wrote in a statement to The Crimson after the event that pollsters are \u201cinherently interested\u201d in how white Catholics vote.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTrump won their vote in 2016, but Biden himself is a white Catholic, and he is trying to win their vote (Hispanic and black Catholics support Biden by a large margin, so even if Biden doesn\u2019t win white Catholics, he might win the \u201cCatholic vote.\u201d),\u201d Brekus wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Kloppenberg highlighted the longstanding role of religious pluralism in U.S. history, referencing the formation of American democracy itself.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s important to acknowledge that the divisions that E.J. talked about have been present in America since before there was a United States,\u201d he said. \u201cAmericans had to learn to live with diversity, and that diversity carried over into the new nation. And so seeing the divisions that we see across liberal and conservative blocks is nothing new.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Both professors discussed how the Trump administration has evolved the role of religion in American politics, first referencing the legacy of former President Barack Obama and his efforts to embrace religious pluralism.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cObama both personally embodied that sense of being different from the presidents who had come before him and the welcoming sense that there was something precious about the American tradition of welcoming difference and embracing difference,\u201d Kloppenberg said. \u201cAnd so I think the signals he was sending out to the world are as antithetical to the signals that we\u2019ve gotten from the Trump White House as it's possible to imagine.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Dionne said that Trump uses religion in a more \u201caggressive\u201d manner than Obama.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNow, what you\u2019ve got with Trump,\u201d Dionne said afterward, \u201cis weaponizing religion in a very aggressive way.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Brekus wrote in a statement after the event that Trump\u2019s efforts to prioritize the voices of white evangelicals contrasts the religious pluralism that has defined American democracy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTrump\u2019s greatest effect on religion has been to privilege the voices of white evangelicals, who have supported him in huge numbers because of their hope that he will restore something that they feel has been lost\u2014namely, the white, Protestant identity of the United States,\u201d Brekus wrote. \u201cIn contrast, both Jim Kloppenberg and E.J. Dionne noted that religious pluralism has strengthened American democracy.\u201d</span></p>"}

Rage\u2019s distinctly powerful musicality \u2014 levied by Tom Morello\u2019s sludgy guitar riffs \u2014 only adds to the song\u2019s weight.</span></p> <p><span><strong>\u201cAmerican Idiot,\u201d Green Day</strong></span></p> <p><span>Somehow, the title feels apt for a president who chooses to go maskless and plan in-person events while knowingly harboring a deadly (and contagious) virus. The 2000s-era punk rockers originally wrote the song as a scathing critique of George W. Bush\u2019s America, but to say that the lyrics don\u2019t apply equally well to the current occupant of the White House? Well\u2026 let\u2019s just say that there\u2019s a reason that 14 years after its release, Green Day\u2019s anthem rose to number one on the U.K. charts ahead of President Trump\u2019s 2018 visit.</span></p> <p><span><strong>\u201cIt\u2019s The End Of World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine),\u201d R.E.M.</strong></span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, this song has never felt so accurate, so it would be wrong not to include the classic \u201ceverything is a disaster\u201d anthem at the close of this list. Even more unfortunately, the hodge podge of stream-of-consciousness lyrics about the world ending don\u2019t seem that catastrophic anymore. Still, as the Movement for Black Lives continues and more Americans start to grapple with the racial and economic inequalities that for too long have formed the basis of our society, maybe the end of the world as we know it isn\u2019t such a bad thing?</span></p> <p><span>Bonus:</span></p> <p><span><strong>\u201cI am the Fly,\u201d Wire</strong></span></p> <p><span>Wire\u2019s incredibly eloquent lyrics \u2014 \u201cI am the fly, I am the fly, I am the fly, I am the fly\u201d \u2014 give listeners the chance to live out their dreams as the true highlight of the vice presidential debate: the fly on Mike Pence\u2019s head.

Kerner.</span></p> <p><span>The <a href=\"https://today.law.harvard.edu/alumni-among-trumps-recent-appointees/\">list</a> of Harvard graduates who have gone on to lead, advise, and staff the Trump administration is extensive. For some, this may seem like business as usual. Harvard has been educating future presidents and Cabinet members from across the political spectrum since <a href=\"https://harvardmagazine.com/2016/11/john-adams-at-harvard\">before</a> the American Revolution. Those leaders have changed the world in remarkably positive ways, but have also made critical errors, led us into unjustifiable wars, and put forth policies that have destroyed communities.</span></p> <p><span>For better and worse, the impact of Harvard alumni reaches practically every geography and field of study. One <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/12/harvards-alumni-impact/\">University-wide survey</a> claims that, as of 2015, Harvard alumni had started 146,429 organizations, created 20.4 million jobs globally, and served on almost 300,000 boards.</span></p> <p><span>On its website, Harvard <a href=\"https://www.harvard.edu/media-relations/quick-facts\">boasts</a> over 371,000 living alumni across 202 countries. I\u2019ve spent nine of the past 10 years at Ivy League institutions and hold no illusions that these degree factories are beacons of righteousness. Surely, we cannot expect a university of Harvard\u2019s scale to track and answer for the actions of each of its graduates. I also understand that intellectually rigorous environments celebrate both experiential and ideological diversity. Inevitably, then, alumni will tread a range of paths.</span></p> <p><span>The Trump administration\u2019s critical mass of Harvard alumni, however, is distinct and the University should address it. Dozens of Harvard alumni seem more than eager to assist the Trump administration in its horrific actions, lending Harvard's institutional legitimacy to an administration that opposes the University's mission.</span></p> <p><span>Trump and his army of Harvard graduates hope to dismantle democracy, undermine the very concept of truth, and expunge the scientific community. Harvard owes its past, current, and future community members a statement of its position on the defective alumni it has produced \u2014 alumni who are destroying the fields and institutions students came here to study.</span></p> <p><span>The University\u2019s <a href=\"https://hr.harvard.edu/our-mission-and-culture\">mission</a> is \u201cto advance new ideas and promote enduring knowledge.\u201d Jared Kushner had the \u201cnew idea\u201d to sacrifice Americans to the market in the face of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/jared-kushner-let-the-markets-decide-covid-19-fate\">COVID-19</a>. Steve Bannon had the new idea to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/nyregion/steve-bannon-arrested-indicted.html\">defraud</a> taxpayers in a racist \u201cWe Build The Wall\u201d scheme. Kayleigh McEnany had the new idea to spread disinformation about vote-by-mail, despite <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2020/05/27/trump-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-has-voted-by-mail-11-times-in-10-years/\">voting by mail</a> 11 times in 10 years, including while at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>The \u201cenduring knowledge\u201d of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been poisoned by disinformation. The enduring knowledge of the Food and Drug Administration is under <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/27/trump-has-launched-an-all-out-attack-on-the-fda-will-its-scientific-integrity-survive/\">siege</a>. The enduring knowledge of our country\u2019s Department of Education is being <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-k-12/news/2017/11/20/442737/trump-administrations-slow-steady-undoing-department-education/\">unraveled</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard\u2019s silence on graduates as recent as 2016 using their Harvard degrees to wage a full-fledged assault on the truth is unworthy of the University\u2019s own \u201cVeritas\u201d motto. Failure to take a position or set the record straight on Harvard\u2019s expectations of its alumni is a tacit endorsement that power itself is the school\u2019s only true value. Discussions of ethical and moral leadership in my classes at Harvard Law School and the Kennedy School ring hollow against this reality. Harvard should publicly commit to higher expectations for its alumni than achieving the social cachet to dance with the stars (as former Harvard Institute of Politics fellow <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/19/20870373/sean-spicer-dancing-with-the-stars-controversy\">Sean Spicer</a> quite literally did last year).</span></p> <p><span>Some may argue alumni have engaged with the Trump Administration because they saw themselves as the lesser evil to fill an important position that would otherwise go to a crony. Evidence does not support this claim. Take, for example, Rachel Brand, who NBC reported <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/justice-department-official-brand-leaves-partly-over-fear-she-might-n847156\">resigned</a> from the Department of Justice just in time to dodge the responsibility of leading the consequential Russia investigation. Brand was in line to replace fellow Harvard Law School alumni Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should he be fired for standing up to Trump. But Rosenstein ended up <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/04/30/rod-rosenstein-leaves-diminished-man-shamed-laywer/\">abetting</a> Trump instead. We\u2019ll never know the truth, as fellow Harvard Law School alumna and then-DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Flores <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/justice-department-official-brand-leaves-partly-over-fear-she-might-n847156\">denied</a> the accusation against Brand.</span></p> <p><span>My call for Harvard to publicly commit to values consistent with its mission by denouncing its cartel of Trump administration alumni must not be conflated with efforts to have prominent universities rescind degrees. Society evolves, attitudes change, and to start revoking degrees based on post-graduation activities could set a dangerous precedent.</span></p> <p><span>But there is little downside to Harvard publicly assuring its community members that it is not proud to have produced a large part of this indefensible regime. Harvard is already under <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/us/trump-ivy-league-election.html\">attack</a> from the Trump administration in both courts of law and the court of public opinion. Publicly acknowledging its role in empowering this collective of bad actors could lead to much needed community reflection on ethical principles and standards across University curricula. Who is Harvard admitting and what are they not learning here? Harvard\u2019s students, faculty, and staff deserve to know if the University stands by these leaders whose minds it claims to have crafted \u2014 leaders who most likely would not have reached their perch without Harvard\u2019s stamp of approval.</span></p> <p><span><em>Kaivan K.

Cho", "body": "<p><span>National newsroom leaders discussed navigating 2020 election coverage in a lecture co-hosted by the Institute of Politics and Shorenstein Center Friday.</span></p> <p><span>Speakers at the event included Brian Carovillano, Vice President and Managing Editor of the Associated Press, David Chalian, Vice President and Political Director of CNN, and Chuck Todd, Host of NBC News\u2019s Meet the Press.</span></p> <p><span>Moderated by Nancy Gibbs, Director of the Shorenstein Center and former Editor-in-Chief of TIME Magazine, the event began with a discussion on how the 2020 election will differ from 2016's contest, particularly given increases in mail-in voting and possible delays in the release of statewide results.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe biggest thing is the disparity and when some votes get counted,\u201d Todd said. \u201cWe could have upwards of 75 percent of the vote not even tabulated in places like Michigan, or Pennsylvania, by midnight on election night.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The unprecedented nature of this year's election recurred throughout the lecture.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cStates and localities are dealing with the counting of those ballots in ways they never have before,\u201d Chalian said. \u201cWe're just dealing with such a massive influx of vote by mail absentee vote, and specifically the states Trump was talking about, that don't have a history of dealing with this.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn some places, it's just going to take a really long time for them to count,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd so also sort of being clear in these next 11 days, I think with, with our audiences, about, you know, the need for a little bit of patience here just because of what we're dealing with in the process of casting and counting ballots in a pandemic.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The speakers also pointed out the differing voting patterns for Democrats and Republicans. Since voting began, more Democrats have participated in the mail-in ballot system, whereas more Trump supporters are planning to vote in-person, Chalian noted.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cDemocrats are voting by mail and early and a lot of this is pandemic related, obviously, and the politicization of the pandemic that we've seen,\u201d Chalian said. \u201cDonald Trump supporters and Republicans are far more inclined to say that they are going to cast their ballots in person on election day. So when you have two totally different electorates, if you will, it's going to be this constant need on election night, to be transparent and explain to the audience at any given moment.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The panelists shared concerns about the danger of releasing inaccurate voting information in order to build a compelling news story early. Gibbs described that pull as the \u201ctemptation towards the premature narrative.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Carovillano argued that a strategy he calls \u201cradical transparency\u201d will be critical in maintaining truthful, real-time information dissemination about voting results.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe are always conservative \u2014 moving more conservative than ever on this election day \u2014 when it comes to...calls,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second part of that strategy is radical transparency, in terms of constantly explaining on the wire, in interviews live on election night, and to anyone who will listen to us, what we understand to be happening, why it's happening, and why it matters.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Carovillano urged individuals to maintain a skeptical attitude toward people delegitimizing election analytics because they are released later than in previous presidential election cycles.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI hope people are starting to understand that there will be people claiming that delays equal fraud, problems, and election malfeasance,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no equation between those two things.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Todd said social media often advances the idea that whichever news source calls the election first is at an advantage.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe fact that people have gotten drunk on social media has sobered up American journalists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have gotten to be a bit more careful in how we debunk misinformation so that it isn't accidentally spreading it.\u201d</span></p>"}

This year, 63 percent of surveyed young people said they will \u201cdefinitely be voting,\u201d which the poll said indicated a similar level of turnout to 2008. Forty-seven percent of respondents said the same in 2016.</span></p> <p><span>The IOP\u2019s Youth Poll conducts biannual surveys of political trends amongst young Americans between the ages of 18 and 29.</span></p> <p><span>Democratic presidential nominee Joseph R. Biden holds a 24 point lead in the youth vote over his opponent President Donald J. Trump, per the results. The poll found that Biden\u2019s favorability among young voters increased by 13 percentage points since <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/24/iop-youth-poll-spring-2020/\">the spring version of the poll. </a></span></p> <p><span>Despite the favorable polls, Biden supporters are less confident that their candidate will win the election compared to Trump supporters. While 63 percent of Biden supporters said they believe he will win the presidential election, 74 percent of Trump supporters expect the president to win.</span></p> <p><span>The poll also reflected the increased popularity of mail-in voting amid the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 50 percent of young Democrats are more likely to vote by mail this election, compared to just under 30 percent of young Republicans.</span></p> <p><span>Still, not all young voters are confident their ballots will be counted. Nearly half of all young Black voters surveyed report they will be voting in person on election day. Meanwhile, seventy percent of young white, non-Hispanic voters indicated they are very confident their ballots would be counted, a marked difference from the 50 percent of young Black voters who said the same.</span></p> <p><span>The poll found a general consensus among young Americans that the government should have an increased role in tackling issues of healthcare, particularly mental health accessibility. Young voters across racial demographics had \u201coverwhelming support\u201d for the government doing more to decrease systemic racism, according to the poll.</span></p> <p><span>The election also comes as young Americans report they are experiencing less joy and more anxiety this fall compared to the spring. The poll noted young Americans are concerned about housing costs and debt, with 57 percent of respondents between 18 and 29 years old carrying debt. Black Americans, college graduates, likely voters, and those who live in urban areas are more likely to hold debt, per the poll\u2019s results.</span></p> <p><span>Young Americans are also evenly split between whether their chances at success are better than their parents\u2019 generation, the same, or worse off.</span></p> <p><span>Kate Gunderson \u201923, a student leader of the IOP Youth Poll, spoke at a press call Monday about how young people \u201cdo not feel secure\u201d in America during the press conference.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe see that young people do not feel secure in America. They feel like they do not have opportunities \u2014 that this isn't a land of opportunities, but rather, it is a land of inadequacies,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are looking for better health care and looking for better mental health services, looking for a better response to the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Raquel Coronell Uribe can be reached at raquel.coronelluribe@thecrimson.com.

Stavins moderated a discussion after Aldy\u2019s presentation, entitled \u201cGreening Economic Stimulus: Lessons from the 2009 Recovery Act.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Aldy, who helped craft energy and economic policy during the Obama administration, emphasized the importance of drawing from past policies \u2014 such as the 2009 Recovery Act \u2014 given what he described as an ongoing deficit of new energy policy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe challenge we face today, though, is that we really haven\u2019t seen any major energy legislation pass Congress and signed into law since 2009,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Aldy argued that the strengths and shortcomings of the 2009 Recovery Act can help inform future legislation. He specifically pointed to how the law facilitated a drastic increase in clean energy expenditure across the nation.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe saw tremendous growth in renewable power. Wind power since 2008 has quadrupled. Solar power in the United States is 100 times the level of 2008,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Aldy also said certain flaws in the Recovery Act can serve as key lessons for the future. He identified non-essential subsidies, delayed implementation, and the withdrawal of non-federal partners as critical challenges.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s really valuable if you\u2019re able to crowd in additional resources from the private sector, or in some cases, crowd in cost-sharing from state and local governments,\u201d Aldy said. \u201cBut it may be that your partners decide not to go forward with the project and then you don\u2019t go forward with those investments.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In a question-and-answer session following his presentation, Aldy compared the energy proposals put forward by Donald Trump and Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaigns. He argued that Trump has not proposed significant energy legislation while in office and that Biden seems relatively interested in promoting sustainable energy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen we spent about $100 billion, that was the largest energy bill ever, and now we\u2019re talking about something that is an order of magnitude larger. So it\u2019s potentially a really big spend that the Biden team has in mind,\u201d Aldy said.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview following the event, Stavins described how holding remote discussions due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has forced those in the Belfer Center\u2019s Harvard Project on Climate Agreements \u2014 which coordinated the webinar series \u2014 to create novel ways of engaging with policy questions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe thought that the pandemic, requiring people in many cases to be remote and to be at home, actually provided an opportunity that we might not otherwise have to bring together a large number of people internationally who were interested in climate change and energy policy,\u201d Stavins said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Stavins also expressed his hope that audience members took away a more informed, nuanced understanding of American energy policy through the series.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI hope that people will leave this session recognizing that here are some real opportunities, but also that it\u2019s often more complex than it first appears,\u201d he said.</span></p>"}

Now, in its Season 46 premiere, the show feels so timid that it can barely provoke a reaction at all \u2014 much less laughter.</span></p> <p><span>In recent years, the show\u2019s development has stalled, flattening its riskier humor into sketches so obvious and surface-level they\u2019re almost condescending. Remote filming was an obvious struggle for the show, but it produced some genius surrealist sketches over these past few months in quarantine. (\u201cEleanor\u2019s House,\u201d Aidy Bryant\u2019s play on a children\u2019s animation show gone horribly wrong, was particularly memorable) One would think that a return to Studio 8H would restore its rhythm and catapult it back to its pre-COVID glory, but in its premiere, the show has again failed to hit its stride.</span></p> <p><span>The episode opens with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wsije1KetVw\">U.S. presidential debate</a> sketch starring Jim Carrey as Joe Biden and Alec Baldwin as President Trump. With source material that could likely function as satire all on its own, one would think that SNL couldn\u2019t possibly mess up the sketch. But they did.</span></p> <p><span>Satire of this increasingly intense election works best when it clutches onto the intricate ticks of the hyper-energetic race \u2014 the awkwardness of the new debate format or the frustratingly benign moderators \u2014 which this sketch doesn\u2019t even attempt to do. Wasting Maya Rudolph\u2019s appearance on a terribly contrived line (\u201cAmerica needs a WAP: Woman As President,\u201d) is one of the times it\u2019s too on-the-nose, leaving no possibility of subversion. Instead, empty crowd-pleasing is the name of the game, where people laugh just because there\u2019s a celebrity on the stage, not because the jokes carry any weight.</span></p> <p><span>This attitude continues across the later sketches: \u201cNBA Bubble\u201d showcases a slate of opportunistic women attempting to quarantine with professional basketball teams. In this and other sketches, the joke never advances beyond a repetitive, 8th-grade punchline.</span></p> <p><span>Chris Rock, an often-biting comedian, comes off as slightly less so in his host monologue about how COVID-19 has disrupted our daily routines. When Rock \u2014 a multimillionaire whose wealth will probably ensure he\u2019ll be just fine in the sea of oncoming global crises \u2014 bemoans the U.S. government\u2019s corruption and quotes James Baldwin, it comes off as entirely unconvincing.</span></p> <p><span>As usual, the real stars are the women. Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9wq14EnezU\">\u201cSavage\u201d performance</a> is an incredibly potent claim to her agency and life as an artist. A Malcolm X quote interrupts the song while the words \u201cProtect Black Women\u201d are displayed on the wall. She proclaims: \u201cWe need to protect our Black women, and love our Black women.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Chloe Fineman\u2019s spoof of \u201cThe Drew Barrymore Show\u201c is another standout: She is wry and perfectly exaggerated, hinting at how enthusiasm on talk shows can be deceptive in the wake of the Ellen DeGeneres <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/08/mystery-ellen-degeneres/615571/\">labor scandal</a>. Another sharp sketch is the song \u201cBottom Of Your Face,\u201d featuring the dynamic duo of Ego Nwodim and Megan Thee Stallion \u2014 a magnetic rap pairing. On \"Weekend Update, Colin Jost and Michael Che fall prey to the week\u2019s chaotic news cycle and end up laughing at themselves \u2014 a bit which used to be charming, but has gotten old very quickly. In that segment, Bowen Yang\u2019s Chinese trade secretary Chen Biao is a welcome reprieve (\u201cShe\u2019s doing the work on racism from her family\u2019s house in Nantucket\u201d is one of the best lines of the night), but also hackneyed: Yang seems to be trapped playing the same character, and doesn\u2019t get to show off his range.</span></p> <p><span>Comedy, at its best, can acknowledge that the world which audiences are living in is fundamentally strange, stressful, and confusing. It can provide a reprieve, and it can force us to reckon with the deeper, scarier truths of our existence while also having a laugh. Can audiences expect SNL to get to that deeper place anymore, or will it continue to fill its weekly slots with timid, celebrity-filled, flashy escapism?</span></p> <p><span>As most of the country\u2019s live entertainment is canceled for the foreseeable future amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, it\u2019s all the more sad that \u201cSNL\u201d \u2014 which has returned in semi-full capacity with a live audience of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/arts/television/snl-live-audience-paycheck.html\">paid first responders</a> \u2014 is so unwilling to take risks in its premiere.</span></p>"}

He said he kept two goals in mind while writing: to show the general public both sides of Supreme Court advocacy and to explain challenges that stand in the way of environmental litigation.</span></p> <p><span>He recounted the difficult road to victory in what he describes as the most consequential Supreme Court decision in environmental law: Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, a 2007 case which Lazarus called \u201cenvironmental law\u2019s Brown v.

{"title": "Biden Leads Trump by 33 Points Among Likely Young Voters, IOP Poll Finds | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Jasper G. Goodman", "body": "<p><span>Young people are far from enthusiastic about voting for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u2014 but they may just hold enough disdain for President Donald J. Trump to do so in big numbers anyway.</span></p> <p><span>A Harvard Institute of Politics Youth Poll released Monday shows Biden \u2014 the Democratic presidential nominee \u2014 with a 33-point lead over Trump among 18- to 29-year-olds who say they are likely to vote. Biden\u2019s advantage marks a 10-point jump from the lead he held over Trump among likely young voters in April, when the IOP released the<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/24/iop-youth-poll-spring-2020/\"> spring edition</a> of the poll.</span></p> <p><span>While less than a third of young Biden voters said they are very enthusiastic about casting a ballot for the 77-year-old former vice president, young people still responded as more likely to turn out to vote than at this time in 2016. Sixty-three percent of respondents said they will \u201cdefinitely be voting,\u201d compared to just 47 percent in the same poll four years ago.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA lot of people have been comparing 2020 to 2016, but what we\u2019re seeing is, it actually compares better to 2008,\u201d Justin Y. Tseng \u201922, president of the Harvard Public Opinion Project \u2014 the student-led IOP program that produces the poll \u2014 said of the potential turnout.</span></p> <p><span>The 2008 election, in which former President Barack Obama defeated the late United States Senator John McCain, marked the highest turnout among 18- to 29-year-olds since the census began tracking voter turnout in 1986. The demographic has consistently had the lowest voter turnout of any age group.</span></p> <p><span>Young Trump voters are more enthusiastic about voting for their candidate than young Biden supporters, according to the poll. But the 60 percent to 27 percent lead that Biden holds over Trump among likely young voters is larger than the one held by Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, at this point four years ago.</span></p> <p><span>Notably, 19 percent of likely young voters in 2016 responded that they would likely go for a third-party candidate; this year, that number is just 6 percent.</span></p> <p><span>The survey\u2019s questions and administration were overseen by longtime IOP pollster John Della Volpe, who is <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/15/iop-pollster-joins-biden/\">now working for the Biden campaign</a>. HPOP analyzed the poll\u2019s results after Della Volpe took leave from his main role at the IOP.</span></p> <p><span>Biden failed to win over young voters in the Democratic primaries, when the demographic largely backed United States Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) instead. But the poll indicates that, despite his lukewarm enthusiasm numbers among young people, they could nonetheless be an important demographic for him in November.</span></p> <p><span>A plurality of 23 percent of young people listed the economy as their top issue \u2014 a striking increase from the spring poll, when just 6 percent of respondents said it was the most important issue for them. However, in stark contrast to the strong marks that Trump receives from the electorate writ large on handling the economy, just 34 percent of young people responded that they trust the current president to manage the economy.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the ongoing pandemic, which has now killed more than 200,000 Americans, the poll also showed that only a quarter of 18- to 29-year-olds said they will \u201cdefinitely\u201d get a COVID-19 vaccine. Twenty-five percent of young Republicans say they will \u201cdefinitely not\u201d get a vaccine, while just 9 percent of young Democrats said they won\u2019t get a dose.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Jasper G.

{"title": "Wearing A Mask that Reveals Too Much | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I was raised not to wear words on clothing. I don\u2019t remember my parents specifically caring or my public school having a policy against them. Perhaps it was the result of modern fashion trends? I wasn\u2019t sure \u2014 but, for my entire adult life, I\u2019ve met this unspoken rule without questioning it.</span></p> <p><span>Lately, however, I\u2019ve found myself intentionally breaking this rule \u2014 and tangling with the ensuing cognitive dissonance.</span></p> <p><span>As I left the suburbs of Westchester for college and the working world, it quickly became obvious why \u201cpolite society\u201d has internalized the norm. Branding yourself can be alienating and limiting.</span></p> <p><span>Companies have long understood this. The president of the United States, for example, recently called for his followers to boycott Goodyear upon reading a tweet claiming it had a policy allowing its 60,000 employees to wear \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d apparel, but not \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d or MAGA gear. The information was false. Goodyear has a policy <a href=\"https://www.wibw.com/2020/08/18/goodyear-employees-say-new-no-tolerance-policy-is-discriminatory/\">against any campaign attire</a> in the workplace. Amid public pressure, though, other mega-corporations like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/business/starbucks-blm-ban-reversed.html\">Starbucks</a> that have previously demonstrated a desire to prohibit divisive labels at work are starting to relax their rules.</span></p> <p><span>Neither retailers nor ambitious people want to limit their customer base. Discussion of politics or religion is particularly frowned upon in white collar settings. Wearing the name of your alma mater across your chest pigeonholes you \u2014 elitist, fratty, poor, dumb, stoner. To some eyes, designer clothes with brand names on them read \u201cforeigner,\u201d \u201cnew money,\u201d or \u201cobnoxious,\u201d while plain, textless purchases from the same stores are considered the height of class.</span></p> <p><span>To wear a label has always felt gratuitously restricting, as if to shout to the whole world, \u201cI am one thing and not the other.\u201d Nevertheless, I have made a notable departure from this convention in past weeks.</span></p> <p><span>Every time I wear my Biden mask out, I am painfully aware of it. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, brands, including campaigns, have turned face masks into their latest billboards. I got the mask as a gift last month. It\u2019s not bright red, but still, people stare. Paying at the checkout counter, walking past others in the street \u2014 I feel physically uncomfortable. The mask is on my face, but I\u2019m shoving my perspective in your face. We\u2019re all trained not to \u201cjudge a book by its cover,\u201d yet in expressing my opinion so blatantly before we\u2019ve even interacted, if we ever do, I\u2019m forcing you to judge. Given the reports of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/aug/28/in-the-name-of-trump-supporters-attacks-database\">confrontations by Trump supporters</a> and the president\u2019s sharing of <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-trump-shares-video-of-supporter-saying-the-only-good-democrat-is-a-dead-democrat/\">a video that says</a> \u201cthe only good Democrat is a dead Democrat,\u201d I admit I\u2019m also nervous about where I wear my Biden mask.</span></p> <p><span>The Biden mask has become a counter-symbol to the MAGA hat. Its impact, however, is both similar and disparate. In his book on mass movements, \u201cTrue Believer,\u201d social philosopher Eric Hoffer explains that those vulnerable to populist fervor \u201ccrave to be rid of an unwanted self.\u201d Supporters discard their personal identity for that of the mass identity. This is a key function the MAGA hat has served since its adoption by Trump supporters, many of whom are rightwing populists. The primary function of my Biden mask, however, is to help me do my part to limit the spread of COVID-19, a deadly virus that has already killed nearly 200,000 Americans.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, in a pandemic of loneliness as the safeguards of our democracy fail, my Biden mask, like the MAGA hat, reveals that I too am in a cult.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI like your mask,\u201d one lady remarked in an otherwise pin-drop silent checkout line at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely letting you in with that mask,\u201d the manager of the local Cambridge spa I frequent told me. Later, the esthetician and receptionist each made a point of telling me they \u201clove the mask.\u201d I\u2019m a private person in my day-to-day interactions and it\u2019s initially jarring to have people react so directly and immediately upon a first interaction. Once I realize this reaction is enthusiastic and blind acceptance from my fellow cult members, however, I feel strangely safer than normal. In a gaslit nation, our cult of decency listens to scientists, supports democratic norms, and knows none of the past four years have been normal. Wearing labels may be limiting, but in this moment \u2014 I suddenly want to draw those boundaries.</span></p> <p><span><em>Kaivan K.

The family continued to build its brand over the years, but it wasn\u2019t until after socialite and stylist Kim\u2019s sex tape with singer Ray J. leaked in 2007 that the Kardashian name reappeared in the headlines. Since then, America hasn\u2019t been able to get enough of the famed family.</span></p> <p><span>In the fateful year of 2006, soon-to-be executive producers Ryan Seacrest and Kris Jenner partnered up with the dream of creating a reality television show about the Kardashian-Jenner family. The reality television market was ripe, with Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie\u2019s \u201cThe Simple Life\u201d dominating the airwaves. One week after Hilton and Richie announced their show was ending, \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d (\u201cKUWTK\u201d) was announced, positioning it as a natural successor to \u201cThe Simple Life\u201d on E!.</span></p> <p><span>The show, now approaching its 21st and final season, has become one of the longest-running reality television series in the country, despite its consistently atrocious ratings (IMDb gives the series a 2.8/10). It quickly flourished into an iconic program, changing the way celebrities are made and how they interact with audiences. The show single-handedly \u201cchanged the face of E!,\u201d according to network executive producer Lisa Berger <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-kardashians-made-65-million-100349\">in the Hollywood Reporter</a>. \u201cWe were a place to report on celebrity; we weren't a place to break and make celebrity, which is now the whole idea of the E! Brand.\"</span></p> <p><span>Most of the episodes of \u201cKUWTK\u201d revolve around the eldest Kardashian sisters, Kim, Khloe, and Kourtney. We, the viewers, are invited into their homes, their cars, their business meetings, and \u2014 more than once \u2014 their bathrooms. We hear about their wild sexcapades and the stress of having to walk two red carpets in one week. It\u2019s a show about the seemingly frivolous life of a (relatively) regular family with questionable eyeliner choices. But how did a show about a blended family in Calabasas endure for so long and give rise to such a sprawling empire?</span></p> <p><span>\u201cKUWTK\u201d represents a side of America that extends beyond our penchant for \u201ctrashy\u201d reality television; it\u2019s a glimpse into the life of the American dream at work. The Kardashians may not have had the humble beginnings often associated with this foundation of American mythology, but relative to where they are now, the Kardashians have grown materially, economically, and socially at an exponential rate.</span></p> <p><span>The Kardashian-Jenner family epitomizes the celebrated American melting pot, descending from Armenian immigrants on Robert\u2019s side and Dutch and British on Kris\u2019s. They came from a line of small business owners and soon established themselves as rich \u2014 but not too rich. Robert was a successful lawyer, positioning the family with a C-list celebrity status, but by no means were they a powerful, multi-billionaire dynasty like their Hilton predecessors. We don\u2019t need to see Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie, two rich girls pretending to be working class, or \u201cone of us\u201d \u2014 we see plenty of that in our daily lives. We met everyone: partners, dogs, spouses, half-siblings, ex-lovers, best friends, plastic surgeons, therapists, trainers. Even amid the turmoil of running billion-dollar empires, the family always stayed united, and more than that, they let us, the viewers, into their family too. We gained membership into the coveted K-family and got to witness their growth firsthand, all the while thinking that if their family could achieve the American dream, we could, too.</span></p> <p><span>In the first few seasons, the show portrays a wealthy family, but one that is still quite real. Kim, Kourtney, and Khloe run their boutique DASH , working and fighting with each other about how to improve their business. \u201cWhen the opportunity for our TV show came about, I wanted to do it to bring attention to our stores,\u201d Kim once said in <a href=\"https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/kim-kardashian-west-bruce-jenner-transgender-empire-brand-1201479125/\">an interview with Variety.</a> The show wasn\u2019t just meant to document the lives of the Kardashians \u2014 Kim had a plan to build her business, just like any other entrepreneur would.</span></p> <p><span>In the early days of the show, the content of the episodes is also somewhat more down-to-earth: footage of Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe manning the storefront of DASH, Caitlyn struggling to get pre-pubescent Kendall and Kylie in the car for school, Kris trying to book her daughters to appear on C-list red carpets. As the family\u2019s fame grew, however, the content of \u201cKUWTK\u201d evolved.</span></p> <p><span>DASH slowly acquired more employees, Kendall and Kylie began exploring the world of fashion and makeup, and Kris was able to book not just Kim \u2014 the \u201cmoneymaker\u201d and famous sister for much of the show\u2019s existence \u2014 but Khloe and Kourtney as well. Then the family\u2019s fame skyrocketed: They sold dash, and in its place emerged countless product lines and companies \u2014 KKW Beauty, SKIMS, Good American, and of course, Kylie Cosmetics. Kendall was the world\u2019s highest paid supermodel in 2018, and we got to see her prepare and bicker with her parents ahead of the Victoria\u2019s Secret fashion show. Kim also gained ground in the fashion world, especially after marrying Yeezy creator Kanye West, with her brand SKIMS and her walks down the red carpet. And who could forget riding along in the car with Kim in 2019 on her way to the Met Gala as she told us how hard it was to breathe while sitting in her rib-shrinking Thierry Mugler dress? Now, Kris regularly books her daughters to appear on \u201cEllen,\u201d \u201cPlayboy,\u201d \u201cVogue,\u201d and every other big name in television, fashion, architecture, and beauty.</span></p> <p><span>We saw every moment of the family\u2019s evolution, from their closets to their home renovations. Their concerns morphed from banalities such as dog-walking and the stress of buying a new car (read: Bentley) to being featured in \u201cArchitectural Digest\u201d and meeting with President Trump to discuss prison reform. The show allowed us to witness a California family transform into a formidable empire.</span></p> <p><span>The Kardashians family is a product of their viewership. They needed us to keep up with them to be who they are. Over the years, we participated in their development . Just as they remained loyal to their family on-screen, they remained loyal to us, seamlessly integrating themselves into our regularly scheduled lives. So we tuned in for nearly 20 years, and we kept an ill-rated, highly-scripted, 60-minute long show \u2014 one that eventually became little more than a commercial for Kardashian products \u2014 on the air from 2007 until 2021. The family exists through the television, and through that television, sitting right there on our couches, we were a part of that family. We were a part of that dream.</span></p>"}

Trump has \u201cset Palestinians and Israelis at least 50 years back.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Trump and his son-in-law and adviser Jared C. Kushner \u201903 facilitated the international agreement, also known as the Abraham Accords. According to Trump, the deal ensures that Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Israel will cooperate on issues like healthcare, education, trade, security and diplomacy, and exchanging embassies and ambassadors.</span></p> <p><span>The deal has landed Trump a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize.</span></p> <p><span>In a rare move during a polarizing election year, former vice president and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden released a statement praising the accords, writing that \u201cit is good to see others in the Middle East recognizing Israel and welcoming it as a partner.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Erekat, however, said he does not believe the accord will advance peace and criticized the negotations for occuring without Palestinian consultation. He added that the deal appears to renege on a previous Arab League-endorsed proposal that states League members would not normalize relations with Israel without a full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the establishment of Palestinian state.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe real problem here is between Palestinians and Israelis. It\u2019s not between Emiratis and Bahrainis, or Bahrainis and Israelis or Emiratis and Israelis,\u201d Erekat said.</span></p> <p><span>In criticizing Trump and Kushner, Erekat claimed the dealmaking used dirty tactics and went over the Palestinian leaders\u2019 heads.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen Kushner tries to tell Palestinians, \u2018Look, I\u2019m working over your head. I\u2019m bringing Arabs to make peace with Israel. You are left alone. You\u2019re abandoned,\u2019 what does this mean to my people? What does it mean to the Palestinians? Is he trying to export fear to them?\u201d Erekat asked.</span></p> <p><span>He also said Trump\u2019s policy toward Israel and Palestine is more harmful than that of previous administrations.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOther presidents \u2014 I\u2019m not saying they were not pro-Israel \u2014 but at least they were trying to achieve a two-state solution on 1967 lines for us to live and let live. That\u2019s what we were negotiating, and we came a long, long, long way,\u201d Erekat said. \u201cThis man and this administration, what they did so far have managed to set Palestinians and Israelis at least 50 years back.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The White House could not immediately be reached for comment on Erekat's criticisms.</span></p> <p><span>In the interview, Erekat said he felt honored to hold the fellowship at the Kennedy School and addressed some of the controversy surrounding his appointment.</span></p> <p><span>He said he appreciated Harvard\u2019s decision to provide a platform to both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, referring to former Israeli foreign minister Tzipi M. Livni, who held the same fellowship last year.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTzipi Livni was my counterpart for many years, and we dealt with each other,\u201d Erekat said. \u201cWe differed, yes. We had agreements, yes. And for Harvard to have her and then to have me, that shows what Harvard is. It\u2019s a great university.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Along with the rest of the Kennedy School, Erekat\u2019s fellowship will take place entirely online due the coronavirus. He said the transition to meeting online with students and diplomats has been difficult but believes it is necessary.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI need to get used to that,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in the human factor, in body language and eye contact.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Erekat\u2019s appointment has brought controversy, following allegations that his beliefs are anti-Semitic and reports \u2014 which Harvard spokesperson James F. Smith denied \u2014 that the Palestinian Authority paid the University nearly two million dollars for Erekat\u2019s fellowship.</span></p> <p><span>Critics, such as pro-Israel advocacy group StandWithUs, have criticized Erekat\u2019s appointment, calling him anti-Semitic and pointing to his words refusing to recognize Israel as a Jewish state.</span></p> <p><span>Erekat dismissed the criticisms and condemned anti-Semitism in the interview.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy conflict with Israel is not a religious one. It is a political one, territorial one, narrative one,\u201d Erekat said. \u201cAnti-Semitism is evil.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Raquel Coronell Uribe can be reached at raquel.coronelluribe@thecrimson.com.

Once you hear their stories, you may want to take the plunge this spring, too.</span></p> <p><span>Jacob R. Jimenez \u201923 logs onto our Zoom call a few minutes late. Just back from the Saturday market, his sole opportunity to leave the idyllic organic farm he\u2019s been working on in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, Jimenez described the strange paradox of his freedom. On the one hand, he has no car, shaky wifi, and is geographically restricted. On the other, he feels a newfound \u201cintellectual freedom and mental health freedom not to worry about the due dates of tomorrow and the assignments of tomorrow.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As Jimenez spends his days weeding, mulching, and seeding new plants; Michael Montella \u201921 is digging his hands into U.S. politics \u2014 fighting for democracy and the freedoms it entails. A virtual organizer for the Iowa democrats, Montella said, \u201cI just cannot imagine a 45-year-old self of my mind looking back and be like, I did not do everything that I possibly could to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and other Democrats in this consequential election.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>North of where Montella and friends are living in Nantucket, Nuri Bhuiyan \u201922, a Crimson Arts editor, is literally sketching blueprints for social justice in upstate New York. In addition to a film internship, she told me she is researching \u201chow a lot of spaces are default built for white people\u201d and \u201cexperimenting with medium to explore this concept of what it looks like for Black Americans to take up space.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A similar entrepreneurial fervor can be found in Mia C. Johansson \u201922, who is \u201ccoding all the time\u201d in her new off-campus apartment in Cambridge. In high school, Mia founded <a href=\"https://www.theteenmagazine.com/\">The Teen Magazine</a>, a site with almost 600 student writers who submit content and offer peer feedback. Having leaped from 20,000 to 70,000 monthly pageviews since the pandemic\u2019s onset, Mia is seizing this momentum. Free from schoolwork but not from responsibility, Johansson described her decision as \u201cscary.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFor the first time in my life, I'm deciding my own goals, I'm setting what success looks like,\u201d Johansson said. \u201cAnd I'm having to keep myself accountable for staying on track.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>These four students are not the only ones diving into new learning experiences: Yeokyeong \u201cYK\u201d Kim \u201923 has just moved from Pennsylvania to Korea for a digital marketing internship; Henry Kuo \u201923 has enrolled in not-for-credit hardware courses at National Taipei University; Guillermo S. Hava \u201923, a Crimson Editorial editor originally from Spain, is tackling Italian while working in Rome.</span></p> <p><span>One way or another though, \u201cfree-falling\u201d students remain connected to the Harvard community, through overactive email lists, professors, alumni, webinars, or \u2014 as has become pervasive \u2014 student organizations; involvement during these times seemingly overrides compliance with the College\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/7/23/leave-of-absence-policies-explainer/\">ban</a> on unenrolled students participating in campus clubs. Students on leave are often still vital to the institutional knowledge of our clubs, enriching the lives of those enrolled. Even if the policy had a coherent logic in past years, it would appear unnecessarily harsh and isolating during times that are harsh and isolating enough.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve loved the response from clubs and groups to be really supportive. Harvard people, like the rest of the world, have grown and become more human, and it feels good,\u201d Bhuiyan shared.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, this sample of students is just that: a sample. Some students taking time off may possess the privilege of having no concrete plans, others may be taking time to financially support their families. Conversely, the pandemic posed significant economic and relational challenges for my family, making Harvard a much-needed haven.</span></p> <p><span>Montella described his time working on the election as a welcome opportunity to \u201crecalibrate.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere were also just like a lot of things that I wanted to do before college ended, like certain travel and just kind of having the time to recalibrate and think about what I would like to get out of my life, rather than just sort of mindlessly going through the Harvard lazy river,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Similarly, Kim craves an opportunity to reflect on her first year at Harvard and take a break to \u201creassess\u201d and \u201cfully understand\u201d her own needs and wants before getting back on campus.</span></p> <p><span>She added, \u201cWith a lot of my friends that I've talked to, if we kind of reflect on first semester and second semester, we weren't doing as well as we tried to tell ourselves that we were doing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The thrill of being busy is an adrenaline rush for many of us, but when this is all we ever know, it can become a problem.</span></p> <p><span>My brother, Jasper Johnston \u201920, who graduated this past spring, once said, \u201cTime at Harvard flies like an ant walking down the aisle of a jumbo jet \u2014 each foot takes forever but suddenly it's a hundred miles from where it started.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Free-falling students remind us that to truly understand Harvard\u2019s unique laws of time, motion, and gravity, and how these forces influence each of us for better or for worse, sometimes we have to get off the aircraft completely. Students leaping into the unknown, falling away from academia, are grounding themselves, putting their Harvard experience, in all of its small, peculiar and arbitrary glory, into perspective, while relying on their vital sources of communal support as parachutes to soften their landings.</span></p> <p><span>I once jumped out of a plane, falling freely, briefly terrified, immersed in a cushion of air, an unparalleled view of the ground, my parachute firmly in place. I might just try it again this spring.</span></p> <p><span><em>Aysha L.J. Emmerson \u201922, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a special concentrator in Resilience Studies in Kirkland House.

Sanger \u201982, a former Crimson editor who co-teaches GOV 1796: \u201cCentral Challenges of American National Security, Strategy, and the Press,\u201d said he told students they should let teaching staff know about any security concerns with their participation in the class. No one has raised any concerns yet, he said.</span></p> <p><span>Sanger added, however, that he would never censor his class material due to political pressure \u2014 but he would look, instead, to improve the security of communications.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s no way we would change the content of our readings or our teaching in order to satisfy the mandates of a government,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a key issue of academic freedom.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Other countries identified by the HUIT web manual as having potential political concerns include Belarus, China, Iran, Iraq, Oman, Russia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and The United Arab Emirates.</span></p> <p><span>Economics lecturer Maxim Boycko wrote in an email that, being from Russia, he understands the potential concerns, but no students have indicated that they needed accommodations in his courses.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI might have been just lucky,\u201d he wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Russian Studies professor Terry D.

{"title": "What the Hell Happened: Kanye West Is Running For President | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Ellie M. Taylor", "body": "<p><span>The Fourth of July holiday in 2020 was a solemn day for a nation in turmoil. Among the countless distressing political events on the minds of many Americans, rapper, billionaire, and husband to Kim Kardashian Kanye West announced on Independence Day that he would throw his hat in the ring of the 2020 presidential race. West made the announcement via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1279575273365594112\">Twitter</a>, calling for the nation to \u201crealize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future.\u201d He received immediate support from his most loyal fans.</span></p> <p><span>It would be generous to say that West\u2019s chances of success are dubious. The <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/506228-fec-to-investigate-false-or-fictitious-filings-for-kanye-west\">Federal Election Commission</a> looked into his declaration, investigating whether West\u2019s filings constituted a \u201cfalse or fictitious claim\u201d without the necessary paperwork to make the run official. West\u2019s campaign also <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kanye-west-missed-deadlines-1048441/\">missed filing deadlines</a> to get on the ballot in many states.</span></p> <p><span>Many popular media outlets chose to largely ignore West in the first weeks of his run. The New York Times ran their first, heavily skeptical, coverage on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/us/politics/kanye-west-president-2020.html\">July 16</a>, and the Washington Post published a similarly incredulous<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/07/dont-take-kanye-west-seriously-or-literally-yet/\"> op-ed</a>. However, over the past few months, as the campaign sputters along, the run has mobilized investigative reporters to allay confusion and skepticism.</span></p> <p><span>Although it is possible to hyper-analyze how West\u2019s lyrics could have been reflected in a potential political platform \u2014 will West support subsidizing Chick-fil-A so they will not be \u201c<a href=\"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-closed-on-sunday-lyrics\">closed on Sunday?</a>\u201d Does he have thoughts about white feminism, specifically <a href=\"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-mercy-lyrics\">\u201cwhite girls,\u201d such as Sarah Palin, \u201cpolitickin\u2019</a>?\u201d How does West feel about the \u201c<a href=\"https://genius.com/Kanye-west-jesus-walks-lyrics\">war on terrorism</a>\u201d relative to other nation-wide struggles? \u2014 this is undoubtedly a waste of breath. West\u2019s platform is ambiguous and he has only had one public event.</span></p> <p><span>The impact of West\u2019s campaign is not in his policy proposals, one of the most articulate being the development of an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/us/politics/kanye-west-president-2020.html\">eco-village\u201d that he would call \u201cBirthday Lake</a>,\u201d or his tweets, including a recent one where it appears that he is urinating on a Grammy award. West\u2019s run poses a risk of delaying mail-in votes across the country due to lawsuits about whether he belongs on the ballot. In Wisconsin, one of the key states to watch this presidential cycle, West took the issue to the State Supreme Court<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kanye-west-suing-wisconsin-and-ohio-ballot-2020-8\"> after missing the deadline to be on the ballot by 14 seconds</a>. Other legal disputes about West\u2019s campaign have played out in Arizona and Virginia. While he has ultimately lost in court, West\u2019s lawsuits in similar states have the potential to delay when ballots are finalized and mailed to voters, costing valuable time in the final push for November. West\u2019s run may exacerbate weaknesses in mail-in voting infrastructure during an election year already fraught with concerns about higher numbers of absentee ballots and the functionality of the USPS.</span></p> <p><span>West\u2019s candidacy exemplifies the chaotic and frustratingly absurd attributes of current American politics, particularly distrust of the \u201cEstablishment\u201d and partisan divisions. In a nation sprinkled with yard signs reading \u201c<a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/833168278/any-functioning-adult-2020-funny-yard?ref=pla_similar_listings_top_ad-3&amp;plkey=d924d6e4004d492dbded1401d178be7eebdbf408%3A833168278&amp;pro=1&amp;frs=1\">Any Functioning Adult 2020</a>,\u201d it\u2019s hardly surprising that another egotistical billionaire is testing out their presidential prospects, this time running as a candidate for \u201cThe Birthday Party.\u201d Albeit bizarre, West\u2019s candidacy is yet another symptom of Americans\u2019 dissatisfaction and exhaustion with the candidates put forward by the two major political parties.</span></p> <p><span>Further, the immediate rush of both support and dismay after West\u2019s declaration reveals how the American political landscape continues to be inextricably linked to social media and celebrity. West declared his candidacy on Twitter; perhaps a rookie mistake, or perhaps part of a cunning strategy to make himself accessible and easily digestible for the masses. Despite recent efforts to distance himself from Donald Trump, West once visited the Oval Office of a man who managed to turn his wealth and fame into self-serving political power.</span></p> <p><span>The political debacle of Kanye West serves as a reminder that the presidency, while at the forefront of many Americans\u2019 minds, cannot be conceived as the sole mechanism for addressing societal problems or fostering social change. While this might be obvious to some, it is easy to lose sight of in an election cycle that has felt especially interminable. The most salient evidence of this problem is our tendency to blame the current president \u2014 not systemic racism, not economic inequality, not corruption and incompetence at any and all levels of government \u2014 for our nation\u2019s ills.</span></p> <p><span>While justified to a certain extent, the hysteria around West\u2019s election expounds on a misconception that electoral politics, and especially the presidential election, determine the fate of a nation far more than anything else. This disheartening conclusion erases the power of citizens and overlooks governmental failures on many other counts.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014 Staff writer Ellie Taylor can be reached at ellie.taylor@thecrimson.com.</span></p>"}

Trump\u2019s nomination of Judge Amy V. Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court Saturday may endanger Harvard\u2019s chances of victory in the lawsuit against it by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, should the case proceed to the highest court in the land, higher education law experts say.</span></p> <p><span>The future of race-based admissions practices nationwide may be at stake in the case, which is currently on appeal in the United States First Circuit Court after a District Court ruled <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/2/admissions-suit-decision/\">last fall</a> that Harvard College\u2019s admissions practices do not intentionally discriminate against Asian American applicants.</span></p> <p><span>The First Circuit heard <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/17/sffa-harvard-appeal-hearing-day-one/\">oral arguments</a> from Harvard and SFFA earlier this month; SFFA President Edward J. Blum said that no matter the outcome of the appeal, his organization was prepared to take the lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court.</span></p> <p><span>Stetson University law professor Peter F. Lake \u201981 said he believes that Barrett\u2019s judicial profile as an \u201coriginalist\u201d will naturally be at odds with established precedents in higher education law, including the validity of affirmative action.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf she's a true originalist, she's going to have to contend with the fact that the level of scrutiny that American higher education now experiences in the hands of the federal government is anything but original to the U.S. Constitution,\u201d Lake said. \u201cI think there's a tension there that could be really interesting to watch her play out.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>While some legal experts agree it is too early to determine what specific stance an appointed Justice Barrett might take on affirmative action, several affirmed that her vote on the court could have critical implications for civil rights.</span></p> <p><span>Indiana University law professor Kevin D. Brown said he believes that if Barrett becomes a decisive vote against affirmative action, the result will be a \u201ccritical loss\u201d for American society.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAffirmative action has really been the way that we've been able to desegregate the higher levels of our socio-economic system,\u201d Brown said.</span></p> <p><span>Jennifer A. Holmes, an assistant counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, also said she cannot predict which way Barrett might rule on specific issues. But despite that uncertainty, Holmes said the fact that Barrett has historically advocated for \u201cflexibility to the stare decisis doctrine\u201d \u2014 or deviation from established precedent \u2014 is enough to raise concerns over Harvard\u2019s chances alone.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHaving the perspective that stare decisis is flexible or is not a guiding legal tenet is just deeply concerning when the Supreme Court has enshrined so many rights for Black people, for marginalized groups, for all sorts of people in the U.S.,\u201d Holmes said.</span></p> <p><span>Brown said he believes that regardless of this year\u2019s election results, Barrett will ultimately be appointed to the Supreme Court.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cShe could very well be confirmed before the election, but even if she's not confirmed before the election, you still have that lame-duck period where there\u2019s time to confirm her,\u201d said Brown. \u201cSo, I would fully expect that she would be on the court certainly by the end of the year, but quite possibly as early as November 3.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><strong><em>Correction: September 29, 2020</em></strong></span></p> <p><span><em>A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Jennifer A.

{"title": "Scholars Trace Violent History of Immigration Policy at 'Border Inhumanities' Panel | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Tracy Jiang", "body": "<p><span>Scholars discussed the origins and evolution of migration and border politics at a panel discussion Monday evening, pointing out violence throughout the history of American immigration policy.</span></p> <p><span>Panelists at the event, which was hosted by the Mahindra Humanities Center, also highlighted how immigration intersects with issues of women\u2019s reproductive rights, racial prejudice, and criminal activity. The discussion followed recent reports of forced hysterectomies on migrants in a Georgia detention facility, as well as long-standing sanitation issues in detention centers.</span></p> <p><span>The event \u2014 the second in a three-part series entitled \u201cBorder Inhumanities\u201d \u2014 was moderated by History professor Kirsten Weld. Panelists included University of Massachusetts at Amherst Professor Laura J. Briggs, Emory University Acting Professor Nicole M. Guidotti-Hern\u00e1ndez, and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Associate Professor A. Naomi Paik.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the increased national attention toward immigration policy under the Trump administration, the panelists warned against what they called \u201cTrump exceptionalism\u201d: the idea that issues at the border are new or worse under the current leadership than they were previously. Several panelists alluded to policies enacted by the Clinton and Obama administrations that restricted and criminalized migrants.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe get the impression that the solution to this is going to be a new president,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cIn fact, what we see is Democrats, the Democratic Party, channeling opposition to the kinds of immigration policies that Trump has enacted. And yet, they are not that different from Democratic policies over a long period of time.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Paik argued that the history of anti-black racism is intertwined with the history of immigration, referencing the 1929 Undesirable Aliens Act that criminalized unauthorized border crossing in the U.S. South Carolina Senator Coleman L. Blease \u2014 who led the push for the law in Congress \u2014 was a devout segregationist.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think it\u2019s really important for us to think about how these kinds of tactics by the state to expel, exclude, and deport people are mobile,\u201d Paik said.</span></p> <p><span>The panelists also argued that those in power have continuously tried to portray and justify this history within a nationalistic narrative.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was a strong reminder that everything we're seeing with border inhumanities in our modern day is a repeat of history, and part of the reason we repeat history over and over again is because we never learn history accurately,\u201d said Josephine M. Kim, a Graduate School of Education lecturer who attended the event. \u201cIt's intentionally kept out of our history books, and narratives are told from a single perspective only.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Many migrants have already faced trauma in their home countries, Guidotti-Hernandez noted, such as domestic violence, genocide, and organized crime.</span></p> <p><span>Panelists also described a paradox between the economic necessity of immigrant labor and the criminalization of these marginalized communities.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHistorically, the United States has wanted people\u2019s bodies and labor, but not their reproduction, and not their citizenship,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cAnd so as long as Mexico and Central America and a host of other places can function \u2014 essentially bantustans \u2014 as reserves of labor that can be called up at certain moments and sent back at other times, people are welcome.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Despite a focus on disheartening facets of the country\u2019s immigration system, the panel ended on a note of hope.

{"title": "\"No, I Don\u2019t Want To Hear Why You Like Charles Murray\" | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For those who aren\u2019t familiar with Charles Murray, first off \u2014 congratulations. Secondly, you should know that his book \u201cThe Bell Curve\u201d claims that racial genetic differences cause lower IQ scores among Black individuals. And so you can imagine that just a week ago when I heard he was <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/24/charles-murray-gov-50/\">invited to campus</a>, the thought that crossed my mind was \u2014 \u201cWho in the world was giving Charles Murray a platform to spread his racism?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/26/david-kane-blog-allegations/\">Recent events</a> regarding Gov 50\u2019s David Kane, remind me and you that, unfortunately, supporters of Charles Murray\u2019s \u201cscience\u201d are not outside our circles.</span></p> <p><span>I still remember my first encounter with a Charles Murray-ist. It was 2017, a few months after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. I had heard that a quieter friend from my English class claimed that, due to evolution, white people were the superior race. The notion that a friend of mine thought that Black people were inherently inferior to white people felt like something out of the Old South.</span></p> <p><span>So, one day after class I asked this friend about Charles Murray, hoping that I could shed some light on the obvious wrongness of Charles Murray\u2019s \u201cscience\u201d and stamp out my friend\u2019s racist ideas. My effort was to no avail. Since then, I cannot tell you the number of conversations I\u2019ve had along a similar vein, where a friend or family member defended something as right or true that I believed to be universally accepted as wrong and undeniably false. The feeling of disgust, despair, and dissonance with all I know to be true is far from foreign now.</span></p> <p><span>In a discussion, whether it be about Charles Murray or Donald Trump or Milo Yiannopoulos, whether it be about police brutality, immigration, the #MeToo movement, or honestly any way Donald Trump handles anything (except for the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2014 I\u2019m still puzzling through his surprisingly appropriate and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1307146028555014145\">respectful comments</a> after her passing), any disagreement feels void of logic and compassion.</span></p> <p><span>The other side is unwilling to acknowledge injustice, history, or hypocrisy. They are unable to concede simple points like \u201call people are created equal\u201d or \u201cpolice officers shouldn\u2019t take innocent lives.\u201d Just look at how Donald Trump refused to denounce white supremacy.</span></p> <p><span>Having these kinds of conversations is exhausting. Having conversations where you discuss a political issue (that shouldn\u2019t be political) where all opinions must be respected (no matter how harmful) is painful, and frankly, feels wrong. Especially when people claim that white people are the superior race, or that immigrant children \u201caren\u2019t my problem,\u201d that \u201call Muslims are terrorists,\u201d or that sexual assault and rape aren\u2019t a big deal.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019ve heard all these statements with my own ears. It is particularly painful when I hear it from the mouths of those I love. These people, I see the goodness in them. I see them as loving and kind. They\u2019re my family, they\u2019re the people who sat across the aisle from me at church, they\u2019re my friends. I watch them care for others in their day to day; they would never bully, assault, shoot, or starve anyone. And yet when it\u2019s about the way their country is run, something shifts which I don\u2019t understand, and this dissonance hurts too. No wonder I\u2019m a bleeding-heart liberal. In every conversation I have with you, you stamp on my heart.</span></p> <p><span>It is exhausting and heartbreaking to have to explain to someone why they should care about the well-being of other people. It\u2019s exhausting to have to explain to someone why even my rights should be respected, and I am a cis-gender white female. Exhausting to explain why you should even care.</span></p> <p><span>It is exhausting, because, when I speak with those who, maybe unknowingly, subscribe to ideas of hate, harm, and lies, it feels as if respect for others, protection of all people, alleviation of suffering within our control, and compassion are all political statements. That these things are negotiable, that I must persuade you to care about basic human rights.</span></p> <p><span>Reading the news is also painful. Because what makes me lose all hope isn\u2019t only what is happening, but that there are millions of my fellow Americans who condone it.</span></p> <p><span>So, speaking to Charles Murray fans, no, I don\u2019t want to hear why you like Charles Murray. I really don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to listen to you justify injustice or dismiss destruction. I think I speak for a lot of people when I say we\u2019ve heard enough.</span></p> <p><span>But, I hate to say it, I think I have to listen. Because I am guessing you \u2014 the Charles Murray-ist \u2014 felt wildly misunderstood reading this article. And maybe, you think my assessment of your values and beliefs is unfair.</span></p> <p><span>Not communicating and not listening to each other isn\u2019t what\u2019s going to change your mind. My giving up on you isn\u2019t what is going to heal the ideologies of this country. No, I don\u2019t want to hear why you like Charles Murray, but I suppose I have to.</span></p> <p><span><em>Annabelle J.L.

Since his resignation, Mattis has criticized the president for ordering the U.S. military to quell protests in cities across the country after the police killing of George Floyd.</span></p> <p><span>Kayyem added that this is a unique time in US politics and predicted that we could be hearing more from Mattis in October, closer to the election.</span></p> <p><span>Heidi D. Jacobson \u201924, who attended the event, said she was inspired by the perspective Kayyem shared during the discussion.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI really liked the way that she seemed to go after her goals,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cI\u2019ve never really talked to someone who's in this field, or actually even gotten any sense of what it would be like and I think that just seeing her was kind of inspirational for me.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This event is the second in a speaker series hosted by HUFPI centered around discussing foreign policy and international events.</span></p>"}

Davis Center associate Rochelle G.

They also compared political masculinity in the United States to tactics Russian President Vladimir Putin has employed.</span></p> <p><span>Sperling and Boatright claimed that Trump\u2019s campaign seriously hindered the chances of Republican women winning congressional seats compared to men. Sperling pointed to the 2016 New Hampshire senatorial race, in which incumbent Senator Kelly A. Ayotte (R-N.H.) lost her seat to her opponent Maggie C. Hassan (D-N.H.).</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is as if, because she was a woman, she was expected to hold a standard higher than men,\u201d Sperling said of Ayotte.</span></p> <p><span>Sperling said in an interview after the event that she hoped audience members took away a broader understanding of how gender stereotypes affect political campaigns and elections.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI would like audience members to walk away with a gender lens that they will then apply to everything political that they see,\u201d Sperling said. \u201cIn other words, to be aware of when they\u2019re viewing a political candidate or a political contest through the lens of masculinity or through the lens of homophobia when ads and pronouncements are playing on gender norms and gender expectations.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In the interview, Sperling also said masculinity is a pervasive bipartisan political tool. She pointed to Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate and said she thought both Trump and Democratic nominee and former Vice President Joseph R.

Pence\u2019s consistent opposition to gay rights and the current administration\u2019s opposition to the Equality Act, which would guarantee anti-discrimination protections to the BGLTQ community. He also referenced the Trump administration\u2019s support for so-called religious freedom exemptions that would permit anti-gay discrimination on religious grounds.</span></p> <p><span>David said the Supreme Court has often lagged behind public opinion on controversial topics, including on the issue of marriage equality. He argued that because of this, he views federal legislative protection through the Equality Act as necessary to ensuring the rights and dignity of BGLTQ people.</span></p> <p><span>To advance those goals, David recommended listeners pursue three courses of action.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe first thing I would say is volunteer to call in, or text in, to those priority states,\u201d he said, urging listeners to participate in phone-banking events in swing states like Wisconsin and Arizona.</span></p> <p><span>He urged those watching to download the HRC\u2019s Team app, which allows users to see whether or not their contacts have voted, and stressed the necessity of increasing voter turnout among those who support BGLTQ rights.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to delving into current events, David also told personal stories during Thursday's event. In response to a student question about speaking with people less informed about BGLTQ issues, he explained that acceptance often requires slow and patient work, recounting the length and complexity of his own coming-out conversation with his parents.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was a conversation about philosophy, religion, fear of death, dignity, all of those things merged into one,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>David pointed listeners to the HRC website\u2019s resource bank, which contains information on topics ranging from the importance of using the appropriate pronouns to the specific states where discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation is prohibited by law.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is the beginning of LGBTQ history month,\u201d McCarthy said, adding that forum attendees should take this month \u201cto learn something about LGBTQ history.\u201d</span></p>"}

Griffin", "body": "<p><span>Following President Trump\u2019s nomination of Judge Amy V. Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, constitutional law professors at Harvard Law School are split between supporting Barrett and denouncing the nomination process.</span></p> <p><span>Trump formally announced his nomination of Barrett on Saturday \u2014 eight days after the death of <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/21/ruth-bader-ginsburg-obituary/\">Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>, who had filled the seat for more than 27 years. The Court vacancy only weeks before the Nov. election has invited questions about whether Trump should be able to nominate a new Justice.</span></p> <p><span>Professor Tomiko Brown-Nagin, dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, wrote in an email that Trump \u201cneedlessly breached decorum\u201d by nominating a Justice before Ginsburg had been buried. She also pointed out the nomination comes after the presidential election has already begun, since more than one million people have cast their ballots, according to data from the United States Elections Project.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe nomination process should await the outcome of the election; the person duly elected president, whether Biden or Trump, should nominate someone to fill the open seat,\u201d she wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Professor Richard J. Lazarus echoed concerns about the timing of the nomination. He wrote in an email Barrett\u2019s confirmation could create a conflict of interest if election disputes make their way to the Supreme Court.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYet, President Trump has made it clear that the prospect of such a case before the Court is precisely why he wants Barrett to be on the Court immediately, before the election, more quickly than any past nominee in memory,\u201d he wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Lazarus noted he wants the Senate to question Barrett on whether, if confirmed, she will recuse herself from an election dispute, as well as whether the White House asked about her \u201cloyalty\u201d to the president before her nomination.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe know that the President is very concerned about such loyalty, as evidenced by his asking just such questions of James Comey when he was serving as Director of the FBI,\u201d Lazarus wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Law School Professor Emeritus Laurence H. Tribe \u201962 also expressed suspicions about the Supreme Court\u2019s involvement in a potential election dispute.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere has never been a Supreme Court confirmation while a presidential election is underway,\u201d Tribe wrote in a Tweet. \u201cThe Constitution permits it, but it\u2019s an irresponsible abuse of power designed to kill the [Affordable Care Act] and pack the Court to back up Trump\u2019s plan to stop counting on Nov 3.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Despite criticism of the nomination process, Professor Noah R. Feldman \u201992 defended Barrett\u2019s qualifications in an article for Bloomberg News. Feldman clerked at the Supreme Court with Barrett in 1998 and described her as a brilliant lawyer with a \u201cjudicial temperament.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI disagree with much of her judicial philosophy and expect to disagree with many, maybe even most of her future votes and opinions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYet despite this disagreement, I know her to be a brilliant and conscientious lawyer who will analyze and decide cases in good faith, applying the jurisprudential principles to which she is committed.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He also argued that concerns surrounding Barrett\u2019s Catholic faith should not disqualify her from the position and claimed that regardless of the politics and circumstances of the nomination, Barrett exceeds the criteria for a good Supreme Court Justice.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen she is confirmed, I am going to accept it as the consequence of the constitutional rules we have and the choices we collectively and individually have made,\u201d Feldman wrote.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Kelsey J.

Su", "body": "<p><span>The Harvard Republican Club has endorsed incumbent United States President Donald J. Trump in his 2020 re-election race, according to a Tuesday evening press release.</span></p> <p><span>The club made national headlines in 2016 when it split from the Republican Party by <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/5/republican-club-not-support-trump/\">refusing to support</a> Trump\u2019s first bid for the presidency, the first time in the group's 128-year history that it declined to back the GOP nominee. Since then, <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/5/27/commencement-2020-republicans/\">a new faction of conservative undergraduates</a> have pushed for the club\u2019s leadership to throw their weight behind the Trump administration.</span></p> <p><span>Trump\u2019s supporters in the group finally got their wish Tuesday, after HRC president Wesley L. Donhauser \u201921 emailed members with the endorsement message from the club\u2019s executive board. The message came just hours after the first presidential debate between Trump and Democratic nominee former Vice President Joseph R. Biden. The federal election will take place on Nov. 3.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOur conservative and Republican convictions compel us to endorse candidates that will fight for an enduring moral order, protect Americans traditions, and prize careful prudence in all decisions for the betterment of Americans,\u201d the message reads. \u201cPresident Trump has demonstrated a commitment to these ideals that surpasses his challenger former Vice President Biden.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The group cited several of what they saw as Trump\u2019s \u201cmarquee accomplishments\u201d on issues including foreign policy and tax reform. Republican Club leadership wrote that they believe Trump has promoted global peace and American interests abroad by \u201cdecimat[ing]\u201d ISIS, moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, organizing two summits with North Korea, and meeting foreign interference in U.S. elections with sanctions.</span></p> <p><span>Club leadership also wrote that they believe Trump successfully corrected trade imbalances by withdrawing from NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership and brokering \u201cnew landmark trade deals\u201d such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.</span></p> <p><span>The message also pointed to what the group considers Trump\u2019s contributions to African Americans.</span></p> <p><span>They wrote that, under Trump\u2019s presidency, African Americans reached \u201chistoric levels of prosperity\u201d and record-low unemployment rates prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. They added that Trump has also committed \u201crecord levels\u201d of funding to historically Black colleges and universities.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is our sincere belief that the policies of the Republican party and President Trump would lead to the most prosperous and safe lives for Black Americans,\u201d they wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Trump has drawn sharp criticism for his record abroad and on issues of race. He has repeatedly declined to condemn white supremacists \u2014 including in Tuesday\u2019s debate, during which he told members of the white supremacist group the Proud Boys to \u201cstand back and stand by, but I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left.\u201d During the same debate, Biden criticized Trump for withdrawing from the Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation and failing to address reports that Russia offered Taliban-linked militants bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan.</span></p> <p><span>The HRC message noted that the club still intends to take advantage of the election to provide Trump and other elected officials with feedback.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe should not be afraid to criticize any elected official, even if they are of the same party,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe celebrate the debate and growth inherent in the election process and look forward to the ideas generated by the national discourse.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In their letter, the club recognized several of what they described as Trump\u2019s shortcomings. They wrote that these include not creating an \u201cacceptable\u201d and \u201cregulated market-based\u201d alternative to the Affordable Care Act, diminishing the \u201cbroad sense of dignity and distinction\u201d of the presidency, and failing to unify Americans across the political spectrum around a \u201cguiding set of principles.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Republicans constitute a minority on Harvard\u2019s largely liberal campus, and Trump supporters an even smaller pool.

{"title": "Harvard Republicans Hail to the Chief | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "The Crimson Editorial Board", "body": "<p><span>Last week, the <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/30/harvard-republicans-endorse-trump/\">Harvard Republican Club</a> chose to endorse President Donald J. Trump for President. This decision is a telling about face from the club\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/5/republican-club-not-support-trump/\">2016 stance</a>, when its members \u2014 dubbing Trump a \u201cthreat to the survival of the Republic\u201d \u2014 offered a scathing rebuke of Trump and declined to endorse the Republican nominee.</span></p> <p><span>The Republican Club has every right to endorse the candidate of their choosing; free country and all. But how they could possibly come to this conclusion \u2014 the day after Trump\u2019s shameful debate showing, when their predecessors left them a blueprint on how to denounce Trump last election cycle \u2014 evades us.</span></p> <p><span>The move strikes a nerve on campus. Hours before their announcement, when asked to denounce white supremacists, Trump told a violent white supremacist group to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/30/proudboys1001/\">\u201cstand back and stand by,\u201d</a> then mused that \u201csomebody\u2019s got to do something.\u201d Not only is it impossible to separate an endorsement of Trump from tacit approval of white supremacy, it\u2019s impossible not to see this endorsement as a provocation that willfully belittles other students\u2019 identity and disregards their safety. At a time when a Harvard instructor is being <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/9/30/gov-50-faculty-reactions/\">credibly accused</a> of defending neo-Nazi groups like Identity Evropa, the Republican Club\u2019s endorsement serves as a further reminder that our campus is not devoid of those who engage white supremacy.</span></p> <p><span>Their endorsement is telling of national attitudes towards Trump, particularly among educated young conservatives. In 2016, when declining to endorse a candidate, the Harvard Republican Club <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/5/republican-club-not-support-trump/\">wrote</a> that Trump\u2019s \u201cauthoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy.\u201d A poll of club members found that an overwhelming majority \u2014 80 percent \u2014 would not support Trump. It is on the back of stories like these that liberals have constructed a disturbingly stagnant narrative of Trump\u2019s base that excludes educated young people. The Harvard Republican Club\u2019s 2020 endorsement challenges the narrative of the \u201creasonable\u201d Republicans \u2014 perhaps most obviously young ones, who are educated at liberal institutions \u2014 are turning against the president in disdain.</span></p> <p><span>Polling evidence suggests that Trump is consolidating his support among young conservatives. 21 percent of 18-29 year olds <a href=\"https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/past/harvard-iop-fall-2016-poll\">backed</a> him against Hillary R. Clinton, while 27 percent have <a href=\"https://iop.harvard.edu/about/newsletter-press-release/harvard-youth-poll-election-2020\">backed</a> him this cycle. These trends suggest Trumpism may well persist in elite conservative circles for a good while.</span></p> <p><span>What made it into the Harvard Republican Club\u2019s endorsement is also telling. Strikingly, concerns about authoritarianism are completely missing from the club\u2019s statement this year \u2014 their paltry list of Trump\u2019s \u201cshortcomings\u201d references only his failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and bemoans the broad loss of \u201cdignity and distinction.\u201d Though the 2016 Harvard Republican Club found then-nominee Trump\u2019s \u201cflirtations with fascism\u201d disqualifying, concrete actions speaking to this concern \u2014 such as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/01/867532070/trumps-unannounced-church-visit-angers-church-officials\">gassing peaceful protesters to snap photos</a> this June and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/24/lawmakers-push-back-againsttrumps-refusal-to-commit-to-peaceful-transfer-of-power.html\">Trump\u2019s refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power</a> \u2014 apparently do not phase the club\u2019s 2020 incarnation. The absence of Trump\u2019s COVID response from their shortcomings list was also felt loudly.</span></p> <p><span>If the Harvard Republicans have learned to spout Trumpisms \u2014 the club\u2019s statement included, word-for-word, campaign promises made in a <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/media/trump-campaign-announces-president-trumps-2nd-term-agenda-fighting-for-you\">Trump memo</a>\u2014 that\u2019s an important data point on how Trump continues to speak to a broadening base of Republican support. As young elites make peace with and even come to embrace his style and politics, an important, scary truth emerges: the Republican Party\u2019s Trumpian elements will continue long after he does.</span></p> <p><span><em>This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board.

{"title": "Bittersweet Empathy: Immigrants, Progressives, and One Failed Conversation | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In late August I spoke with an old Russian woman. I had never met her, and I never will.</span></p> <p><span>I called her to see if she was voting in the Massachusetts Senate Democratic Primary. I spent much of my summer making those campaign cold calls, and I was usually cut off after that initial question.</span></p> <p><span>She and I spoke for over two hours.</span></p> <p><span>I learned that she lives alone, and does not have many people with whom she can discuss politics. She emigrated before the fall of the Soviet Union and still feels grateful for grocery stores.</span></p> <p><span>She told me that she had been a staunch Democrat since she stepped foot in the United States, but was now losing faith. For her, seeing Democratic leaders kneel and side with protesters amid mass looting and anarchy revealed a weakness and hatred for their country that she couldn\u2019t stomach.</span></p> <p><span>After a long pause, she said something I remember viscerally: \u201cWhere I come from, your leader kneels only when someone has a gun to his neck.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This stuck with me but I\u2019m still not sure what she meant. Perhaps she was recalling weak-willed local leaders who were mere puppets of a larger autocracy. Maybe it was a much broader claim, that strength and force \u2014 which she felt she could no longer find in the Democratic party \u2014 were, in her experience, the ultimate metrics of leadership.</span></p> <p><span>I disagree with her stance on the protests completely: To me, the demonstrations have been a long-fated reckoning, and the Democratic Party\u2019s choice to kneel was distasteful not because of the legitimacy it afforded protesters but because it reeked of performance and accomplished nothing.</span></p> <p><span>Intellectually I was frustrated, even repulsed by this woman, whose arguments sounded like Fox News headlines jammed in a washing machine. But I also felt an unexpectedly acute sympathy for her \u2014 she, who grew up without the freedoms offered (ostensibly) by democracy and capitalism, coming to this country and finding leaders ready to give it all away; she, who responded to my decision to skip lunch and continue our conversation with an affectionate disapproval I associate faintly with my grandmother, who always wanted me to eat more.</span></p> <p><span>That nascent but deeply affecting tie I felt to her did not affect my views on the protests. But our conversation unsettled me. I grew reticent and defensive with her. I eventually ended the conversation with a flimsy excuse and hollow guilt. Not only had I failed to convince her of anything \u2014 a heavy blow for a college debater \u2014 I had cut her off with the knowledge that our conversation might be her only one that day.</span></p> <p><span>In the days after our call I was able to be more reflective. I realized I had let my political ideology circumscribe my empathy. And while this habit is unfortunately common in an era of polarization, it seems particularly pernicious among progressives engaging with immigrants.</span></p> <p><span>We cannot value immigrants\u2019 lived experiences only when those experiences inform politics we like. My surprise at making a connection with the woman I spoke with is itself surprising and frankly disturbing \u2014 indicative of both my inability to come to terms with the emotional and embodied nature of political discourse, and the toxic standard of perfect liberalism to which we hold immigrants.</span></p> <p><span>With issues like criminal justice, reparations, and illegal immigration, progressives cannot project uniformly left-of-center ideas onto immigrants.</span></p> <p><span>In 2017, amid uncertainty about the future of DACA and asylum policy, Democratic lawmakers in Maryland tried to create a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/us/legal-immigrants-who-oppose-illegal-immigration.html\">sanctuary county</a> for undocumented immigrants. Despite the majority Democratic area, the bill failed: It was passionately opposed by legal immigrants, a turn of events that shocked and antagonized progressives. The tacit assumption that immigrants would support liberal immigration reform was homogenizing, erroneous, and fatal.</span></p> <p><span>But Maryland Democrats statewide did not take enough notice. Months later, a similar sanctuary city proposal was made in the state legislature. It also failed despite a two to one Democratic majority, in part because of objections made by some of the same legal immigrants.</span></p> <p><span>I did not hear much about illegal immigration while I phone banked. But people I called frequently brought up reparations, often framing it as a yes-no debate demarcated by a party line. Those who most fervently opposed reparations echoed a sentiment I have heard from friends, parents of friends, and other strangers: They did not feel that they should bear the same guilt for America\u2019s sins as people with centuries of ancestors here.</span></p> <p><span>With race-related issues, immigration necessitates more nuanced analysis than it has tended to receive. Immigrants are subject to the precarity of racial capitalism, with visas determined by market whims and ethnic origin. But they are also settlers on stolen land, who often reap benefits from the vestiges of slavery. And immigrants from \u201cnon-shithole countries,\u201d as President Trump would put it, are weaponized as successful American dream stories to mask structural discrimination in education, hiring, wealth, and more.</span></p> <p><span>I don\u2019t know where that leads us, and I had trouble articulating any of it to the woman on the phone. Her decades of life (understandably) mattered more to her than the vaguely Marxist ramblings of a teenager.</span></p> <p><span>But our conversation was meaningful. It reminded me that empathy can coexist with unflinching political demands, and that disagreement should fuel reflection rather than dogma. And I hope that she is a little bit more open to civil disobedience, the way I am now a little bit more grateful for my local supermarket.</span></p> <p><span><em>Talia M.

According to numerous publications and witnesses, thousands of protesters have faced <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53776461\">arbitrary detainment</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53773534\">torture</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/world/europe/beatings-detentions-belarus-lukashenko.html\">many still missing or facing imprisonment</a>. Konstantin Shishmakov, a museum director who had refused to sign a falsified electoral protocol claiming that Lukashenko had won the election, <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/activists-in-belarus-say-dozens-unaccounted-for-amid-political-crisis/30794079.html\">disappeared</a> only days after taking his stand. He was found a few weeks ago, hanged in a nearby forest; investigators claimed there was no evidence of a crime. Video footage published by the Associated Press similarly suggest that Alexander Taraikovsky, a protester whose death had been reported an accidental suicide by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, was actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/16/shot-right-in-the-chest-partner-denies-belarus-protester-was-killed-by-own-bomb\">shot by policemen, empty-handed</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, described as \u201cthe man Vladimir Putin fears most,\u201d has been in a coma after his doctors admitted that he had likely been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/20/a-cup-of-tea-then-screams-of-agony-how-alexei-navalny-was-left-fighting-for-his-life\">poisoned through his tea at an airport</a> on August 20.

Meanwhile, conflicts from Libya to Syria to Sudan continue to rage, their stories passed over as old news.

Protesters in Hong Kong, fighting for freedom from their oppressors in a way strikingly similar to that of our American forefathers, faced silence from the country whose empathy should have been strongest.</span></p> <p><span>The lack of any significant involvement with contemporary foreign affairs by the American public is disappointing. For a people who believe themselves morally superior to the rest of the world, our willful ignorance and active disinterest in matters concerning human rights exudes selfishness and lack of basic human compassion. The prior summarization of ongoing events does not even begin to scratch the surface of the atrocities taking place every day across the world. However difficult, we must try to think not just of ourselves, but of the many whose stories are in danger of passing by unnoticed.</span></p> <p><span>Are you watching?</span></p> <p><span><em>Noah D.

Brezine, <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/6/5/urton-more-allegations-anthropology-faculty-demand-resignation/\">accused Urton of sexual harassment</a> in June after <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/5/29/harvard-anthropology-gender-issues/\">an investigation by The Crimson</a> found that a different former student had accused Urton of pressuring her into \u201cunwelcome sex\u201d before writing her a recommendation letter in 2011.</span></p> <p><span>In June, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/6/3/urton-admin-leave/\">placed Urton on paid administrative leave</a> following The Crimson\u2019s investigation. Urton announced plans last month to <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/7/15/urton-retires-harvard-anthro/\">retire at the end of August</a>, though it remains unclear whether he has followed through with those plans.</span></p> <p><span>He did not respond to a request for comment on the ODR findings Wednesday.</span></p> <p><span>Gay or a designee will ultimately review ODR\u2019s findings and determine sanctions. If Urton retires, Gay retains the ability to strip him of his emeritus distinction, as step she took after former Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/3/6/dominguez-to-retire/\">retired while facing multiple allegations</a> of sexual harassment.</span></p> <p><span>FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment.</span></p> <p><span>In her Title IX complaint against Urton, Guedes wrote that she had agreed to go to lunch with Urton in July 2012, believing that he wanted to discuss her research.</span></p> <p><span>The following morning, Urton emailed her from his FAS account asking if she wanted to \u201cplan a time to have a tete-a-tete, daytime or nighttime, rather than leaving it to chance?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Later that day, she received an email from Urton\u2019s personal email account asking if she \u201cwould be interested in something more intimate.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI mean, lunch is still on offer, and would be quite pleasant, but, well, what if I got a hotel room and then we got a bottle of wine and spent an afternoon in conversation and exploration?\u201d Urton wrote in the email.</span></p> <p><span>Urton quickly followed up with an email asking Guedes to disregard his second message, calling the offer a \u201cbad and inappropriate idea.\u201d Guedes wrote in the complaint she was upset and shocked by Urton\u2019s solicitation, but decided not to report it because she feared professional retaliation from Urton, who chaired the Anthropology department at the time.</span></p> <p><span>Guedes said Wednesday that she was heartened that ODR had substantiated her allegations against Urton, but she felt the investigation revealed pitfalls of Harvard\u2019s Title IX policies and procedures, particularly those that were in place prior to 2016.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEven an egregious example like this of what is clear sexual harassment, they wouldn\u2019t call it sexual harassment,\u201d she said of the former policies. \u201cThey\u2019ll say it was a violation of professional conduct, so I would wonder where they would draw the line \u2014 is rape not sexual harassment?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe way that they defined this in their policy really makes it extremely hard for any victim to seek justice,\u201d she added.</span></p> <p><span>Guedes said she hopes Harvard will consider taking action to retroactively change the policy, which it still uses to investigate allegations of conduct that occurred before 2016.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was really backwards of Harvard to define the sexual harassment in the way it did up such a late date,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is something they should be ashamed and embarrassed of, and that they should actively be thinking about how to retroactively rectify that.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is why institutions shouldn\u2019t be allowed to determine what constitutes sexual harassment and what doesn\u2019t,\u201d she added.</span></p> <p><span>Guedes said ODR asked her to participate in an interview during the investigation, but she said she refused because other women told her it was a \u201chuge trauma\u201d for them.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThroughout these interviews, [the investigators] are questioning everything that they said \u2014 there was no way I could handle sitting through those interviews,\u201d she said. \u201cI consider them an intimidation tactic from ODR to try to get people to drop their claims.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Guedes also said investigations into Title IX complaints should be handled by third party investigators not affiliated with the University, a step Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers has pushed <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/4/25/union-non-discrimination-proposal/\">for several years</a> in negotiations with the University.</span></p> <p><span>University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment.</span></p> <p><span>Reva Dhingra, a grievance officer with HGSU-UAW, wrote in an emailed statement that Guedes\u2019 case reflects \u201cjust how inadequate Harvard policies were in protecting student workers from harassment and the threat of retaliation.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWith the Trump administration actively undermining Title IX, it is extremely important for student workers facing harassment to be able to obtain recourse through a neutral third party grievance procedure codified in the next union contract,\u201d Dhingra wrote.</span></p> <p><span>She added that it took years of activism to force the University to prohibit faculty sexual relations with students, and the union would continue to work to \u201cfight for better definitions such as affirmative consent provisions instead of the \u2018unwanted\u2019 conduct standard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSadly, this case is by no means unique at Harvard,\u201d Dhingra wrote.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer James S.

Abdelhamid \u201922 decided not to enroll this semester so he could preserve a year of eligibility to compete for Harvard Athletics. His teammate, Maddie P. Chai \u201921, on the other hand, is taking online classes.</span></p> <p><span>Faced with similar decisions after the Ivy League cancelled fall sports in July, Chai and Abdelhamid chose different paths. They are two of the hundreds of Harvard student-athletes who had to decide whether they would take time off, hoping to preserve an extra season of eligibility to play their sport, or enroll in classes and potentially forgo a year of college sports.</span></p> <p><span>Abdelhamid, who is from Cairo, Egypt, said that, as an international student, he hopes to spend as much of his college career as possible in the United States and alongside his teammates.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPlaying squash in itself wasn\u2019t one of the big driving forces that drove me to make this decision. It was the team spirit, the team workouts together, the team training,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn't want to miss out on this feeling \u2014 this camaraderie \u2014 between my teammates and the good memories we\u2019ll remember from the college days together.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Chai said she has already enjoyed three memorable years on the squash team \u2014 during which the team accrued three national championship titles \u2014 and has a job offer awaiting her after graduation that she cannot defer.</span></p> <p><span>Though her job offer prompted her decision, Chai said there are also benefits to enrolling online, including using her time off from squash to focus on other interests. She is volunteering for Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, organizing the Harvard Votes Challenge \u2014 a group promoting voter turnout among Harvard students \u2014 and working at a restaurant.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAll of those things I could have never done during the school year, just because I am so busy with squash,\u201d she said. \u201cI looked at this year as an opportunity to use all this free time I have now that I don\u2019t do squash and do things that I am really passionate about as well.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>For Abdelhamid, delaying graduation was less of a concern.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhy the rush? Why the hurry?\u201d he said. \u201cI should just wait a year, try to be as productive as possible, and make the most out of this year and go on, hopefully once school is back next year, [to] enroll again.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>By \u201cproductive,\u201d Abdelhamid is referring to playing professional squash in addition to seeking internships. He is currently ranked 182nd in the world for squash.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI want this year to be a big jump for me squash-wise,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Fencing captain Cindy Gao \u201921 also said her relationship with her teammates motivated her to take a gap year.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSome of my closest relationships were formed throughout my time on the team with my teammates, and having a schedule and practice for like 20-plus hours a week is, at times, very difficult, but also very grounding,\u201d Gao said.</span></p> <p><span>She said she is training at her fencing club at home in Toronto, Canada and hopes to pursue teaching opportunities.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen I think about Harvard, fencing is definitely a huge part of it for me. And I can imagine Harvard without fencing, but when I imagine it, it sucks,\u201d Gao said.</span></p> <p><span>The Ivy League has only officially canceled fall sports due to the coronavirus pandemic, but Gao said she is not hopeful that there will be a fencing season this winter, citing the University's decision to only bring a limited number of students to campus.</span></p> <p><span>Though Gao is taking a gap year because she does not want to miss out on another season, football captain Jordan G. Hill \u201921 said he believes he can enroll this fall \u2014 when the football season usually takes place \u2014 while still maintaining his eligibility. He said he is hopeful he and his teammates can play their season during the spring, given that several other college conferences are already playing football this fall and those that are not are considering playing their seasons in the spring.</span></p> <p><span>If Harvard football does not resume this spring, however, Hill said he will consider taking the spring semester off so that he can return to Harvard next fall to finish out his collegiate football career.</span></p> <p><span>In the meantime, Hill said he and his teammates are continuing to train on their own so they are ready to compete whenever they are allowed back on the gridiron.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have confidence in the guys on the team that they\u2019re doing what they need to be doing, and at the end of the day we're still a very talented team,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Ema R.

Della Volpe, <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/20/volpe-polling-the-pollster/\">whose research has focused on youth political engagement</a>, comes as Biden is working to make inroads with younger voters \u2014 a demographic he failed to woo during the Democratic primaries.</span></p> <p><span>Della Volpe wrote in a statement to The Crimson that he will continue to work on strategic planning for the IOP\u2019s Youth Poll, but will step back from the project\u2019s day-to-day operations.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhile I have remained fiercely non-partisan over my years at the IOP, the critical role Gen Z and Millennials can play in the election, and knowing how important a priority the youth vote is to this election has prompted my decision to re-engage in politics and do my part,\u201d Della Volpe wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Biden struggled to win over young voters by large margins, even as he consolidated broad support among other demographic groups in the final spate of primaries, during which he faced off against United States Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sanders has been lobbying Biden to conduct more outreach to young people and Latinx voters \u2014 two groups Sanders won by a landslide in the primaries.</span></p> <p><span>The <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/24/iop-youth-poll-spring-2020/\">spring 2020 iteration of the IOP\u2019s Youth Poll</a>, which Della Volpe oversaw, showed Biden with a 23-point lead over Trump among 18- to 29-year-olds. But Biden\u2019s low favorability among young adult voters, shown in other recent surveys, have made focusing on bolstering youth turnout crucial for the campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Chase H.

To this end, <a href=\"https://news.wbfo.org/post/your-story-textbooks-ours-isn-t-buffalo-schools-adopt-1619-project\">many public school districts</a> are incorporating the New York Times\u2019 \u201cThe 1619 Project\u201d into their curriculum. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html\">The 1619 Project</a> is an interactive project (originally consisting of essays, poems, fiction, and photos, now adapted into a<a href=\"https://pulitzercenter.org/lesson-plan-grouping/1619-project-curriculum\"> podcast</a> and <a href=\"https://pulitzercenter.org/lesson-plan-grouping/1619-project-curriculum\">free online curriculum</a>) that reexamines U.S history by centering African slavery in our understanding of America\u2019s past and present, beginning in 1619 \u2014 the year the first slave ship arrived on America's shores. The effort positions slavery \u2014 often woefully <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2018/02/07/how-is-slavery-taught-in-us-schools.html\">mistaught</a> in U.S schools \u2014 and its legacy as critical to understanding wide-ranging aspects of American society and history.</span></p> <p><span>The 1619 Project being incorporated into schools has drawn outrage and criticism from Republican lawmakers. In July, Senator Tom Cotton \u201998 (R-Ark.), a former Crimson Editorial editor, <a href=\"https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=1400\">introduced</a> a bill that would prohibit distributing federal funding to K-12 schools and school districts that teach The 1619 Project. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich have argued that The 1619 Project is un-American propaganda, and that its incorporation in educational curriculum encourages the revision and politicization of American history.</span></p> <p><span>Ever upping the ante, President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1302586046551597061?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwgr%5E393535353b636f6e74726f6c&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-warns-schools-teaching-1\">tweeted</a> on Sept. 6 that the Department of Justice will investigate whether California public school districts are using the project in their curriculum. He warns such schools will be <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/06/politics/trump-education-department-1619-project/index.html\">defunded</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Public school curriculum generally does not adequately cover racial history. As a result, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/08/28/teaching-slavery-schools/?arc404=true\">horror stories</a> of teachers instructing students to list the pros of slavery and orchestrating mock slave auctions abound. We oppose any attempts to hinder improving slavery\u2019s teaching in the U.S, recognizing the damage an inadequate racial education can cause. When American history is taught without the nuance racial history provides, educators risk cultivating students with damaged perceptions of the world.</span></p> <p><span>The stakes of understating the impacts of American slavery are high. Educators must intentionally teach students about the formation and development of oppressive institutions and systems in the U.S, because, without understanding their legacies, dismaying statistics and blight in Black communities in the U.S can appear to be matters of personal responsibility, not facets of the long shadow of slavery. The absence of Black history in curriculums hinders the cultivation of empathy and denies students critical context needed to engage with racial issues and racial identity.</span></p> <p><span>To deem centering this history as un-American suggests a dangerous idea of what it means to be American.</span></p> <p><span>Labeling The 1619 Project as such suggests that Black history in the U.S. is not American history. It implies that it is un-American to recognize violence and discrimination against Black people. Ultimately, it suggests that validating the experiences of Black Americans is inherently un-American \u2014 a nasty undercurrent likely underpinning the largely white history we are taught in schools.</span></p> <p><span>Examples set by other countries that rigorously teach their ugly racial pasts should dispel fears that projects like The 1619 Project will inspire a decline in patriotism. See <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/loss-liberation-germanys-evolving-postwar-attitude-63534065\">Germany</a>, where concentration camps are used as teaching sites to impress upon students the horrors of anti-Semitism, or<a href=\"https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/south-africa-fast-facts/news-facts/study-finds-south-africans-are-proud-and-patriotic-ahead-of-freedom-month?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0M-07bri6wIVDfDACh311QJlEAAYASAAEgIpf_D_BwE\"> South Africa</a>, where national pride soars even after the country undertook a national truth-telling initiative to address its long history of institutionalized racism under apartheid. Despite these countries\u2019 pasts and their acknowledgements of horrifying wrongdoing, patriotism lives on. Germany and South Africa signal that America\u2019s students need not be exposed to a solely positive (and consequently, incomplete) version of history to be patriotic.</span></p> <p><span>Trump's reaction to The 1619 Project strikes us as a barefaced attempt to score political points and pander to growing conservative opposition to cultural sensitivity efforts, rather than legitimate historical criticism. His threat to defund California schools who teach The 1619 Project is authoritarian and undemocratic \u2014 an attempt to outlaw readings of history that displease him.</span></p> <p><span>This attempt to censor our collective memory is an encroachment upon American freedom: textbook dictator-style. This is not how any normal democratic government would operate, but it has become a trademark of this president: threatening to withhold federal fundings as a political gimmick, as he did earlier this year to pressure K-12 to reopen in person despite the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p> <p><span>Without rich primary source materials to expose children to the hard truths of slavery in America, indifference to generations of routinized, legally sanctioned murder, sexual violence, and forced labor can run rampant. Politics that denounce the legitimacy of the needs of Black and other marginalized communities, that diminish and seek to control their histories, and that perpetuate their oppression do so on the back of that indifference. Education is the best hope against that indifference, and the cruel policies it sustains.</span></p> <p><span><em>This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board.

Simauchi", "body": "<p><span>Roughly 75 people, including multiple Harvard affiliates, gathered in front of Government Center in Boston Tuesday to protest a court ruling that allowed the Trump administration to end protections for approximately 300,000 immigrants shielded from deportation under the Temporary Protected Status program.</span></p> <p><span>On Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, based in California, ruled in a 2-1 decision that the Trump administration could legally terminate the program, known as TPS, for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan.</span></p> <p><span>The ruling reverses a preliminary injunction issued by Judge Edward M. Chen of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California in October 2018 preventing the Trump administration from ending the protections.</span></p> <p><span>Judge Consuelo M. Callahan, who wrote the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion, based the court\u2019s decision on the plaintiffs\u2019 inability to demonstrate \u201cracial animus\u201d as a motivating factor in the decision to end TPS protections.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe district court cited no evidence linking the President\u2019s [racial] animus to the TPS terminations\u2014such as evidence that the President personally sought to influence the TPS terminations, or that any administration officials involved in the TPS decision-making process were themselves motivated by animus,\u201d Callahan wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Congress created TPS in 1990 to provide a temporary reprieve from deportation to certain immigrants whose countries of origin were deemed unsafe. Currently, individuals from nearly a dozen countries are protected through the program, although U.S. President Donald Trump has sought to strip TPS status since nearly the beginning of his term in office.</span></p> <p><span>Monday\u2019s decision, though, will likely not be the last word on the subject. In light of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision, the plaintiffs in the case plan to file an appeal. A potential Biden administration could reinstate TPS protections.</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, news of the decision left some of Harvard\u2019s TPS recipients in tears.</span></p> <p><span>Doris Reina-Landaverde, a custodial worker from El Salvador who rallied the crowd at Tuesday\u2019s protest, said the news was heartbreaking, as she recognized that the court\u2019s decision was a major setback for her and her family.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen I received the news yesterday, it was devastating because I had hope that the outcome would be positive,\u201d said Reina-Landaverde, an organizer with the Massachusetts TPS alliance. \u201cWhen I saw the message, it was hard, I\u2019m not going to lie and tell you that I didn\u2019t cry.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI crossed the border and survived, why should I be scared of fighting for my family, my TPS family,\u201d she added.</span></p> <p><span>Reina-Landaverde, who has been living in the United States for 20 years, also said the potential phase-out of TPS disproportionately affects essential workers.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe majority of us are essential workers risking our lives to do this work for the community,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we are already risking our lives, exposing ourselves to the virus to keep the community safe, why can\u2019t we do the same to protect ourselves?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Monday\u2019s ruling could leave hundreds of Harvard affiliates with uncertain futures, as the decision could allow for removal procedures to start as early as January 5, 2021.</span></p> <p><span>Close to 200 Harvard affiliates are TPS recipients, according to Reina-Landaverde; there may be more, she said, but many\u2014out of fear of jeopardizing their legal status\u2014choose not to speak out.</span></p> <p><span>In early 2017, the University <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/2/2/immigration-order-town-hall/\">hired</a> immigration attorney Jason M. Corral to <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/2/2/immigration-order-town-hall/\">provide legal counsel</a> to undocumented students. Corral is the only full-time attorney on campus charged with addressing immigration-related issues.</span></p> <p><span>University President Lawrence S. Bacow has also <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/3/16/bacow-letter-daca-tps/\">lobbied</a> congressional leaders on immigration, calling for \u201ca pathway to citizenship\u201d for TPS and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients.</span></p> <p><span>But the administration\u2019s efforts have been underwhelming, according to some Harvard TPS recipients.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cRegarding TPS, Mr. Bacow the only thing he\u2019s done is go to Congress and talk about DACA and TPS and then did nothing else,\u201d said Julio A. Perez, another custodial worker and TPS holder. \u201cFrom him, I don\u2019t expect anything, I expect more from the community.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bacow, in a written response to the Supreme Court\u2019s June ruling on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, called on the United States Congress to act on immigration reform.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cCongress should now turn its attention to immigration reform and provide a pathway to citizenship for these young people and others, including individuals with temporary protected status,\u201d Bacow wrote in a June email to Harvard affiliates.</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, Perez mentioned that he was more optimistic about receiving support from Harvard students and those in the greater Cambridge area.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth, the support we receive from Harvard is from the community,\u201d Perez said. \u201cIt\u2019s from the workers, our bosses, our colleagues, the students, it\u2019s that support that we count on.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Kevin A.

He was head of the Palestinian delegation at the Madrid Conference of 1991, and has served as Chief Negotiator during the Oslo Accords in 1993 and 1995, the Camp David Summit of 2000, and the negotiations at Taba in 2001.</span></p> <p><span>His objective is to solve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict with a two-state solution based on borders negotiated in 1967, according to a Kennedy School biography posted on the school\u2019s website.</span></p> <p><span>In a Tuesday statement to The Crimson, Shlomo Ben-Ami, former Israeli Foreign Minister and Minister of Security, wrote that Erekat \u201cis a good man and an eloquent champion of the Palestinian cause.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Ben-Ami served as the chief Israeli negotiator during the Camp David Summit and the negotiations in Taba, working opposite Erekat.</span></p> <p><span>After recognizing his counterpart in a failed peace process, Ben-Ami said he believes Erekat \u201ccan offer students and faculty interesting insights on why Palestinian diplomacy failed in its central objective, reaching statehood and preventing the demotion of the Palestinian cause from being the epicenter of the region\u2019s worries into its current status as a disposable item in the Arab regime\u2019s priorities.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Erekat has previously said that the peace deal among the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and Bahrain, signed Tuesday at the White House, was \u201can Arab dagger in [his] back.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The agreement, the so-called Abraham Accords, entails new diplomatic and economic ties among the three countries.</span></p> <p><span>The Abraham Accords, pushed by U.S. President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared C. Kushner \u201903, fractured a long doctrine set by the Arab League that for years barred negotiations between the Arab states and Israel until Israel recognized the existence of a Palestinian state.</span></p> <p><span>Erekat has said Trump is sending a political message with the deal and that the formation of an alliance is for Israel\u2019s protection rather than for peace.</span></p> <p><span>In his statement to The Crimson, Ben-Ami echoed Erekat\u2019s past statements about the new agreement.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSaeb is absolutely right to define Israel\u2019s peace with the UAE and Bahrain as \u2018peace for protection,\u2019\u201d Ben-Ami wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Ben-Ami, however, maintained that the new peace deal, which he called a \u201csham state,\u201d comes after the Palestinians rejected several peace offers.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is the serial Palestinian rejection of substantial peace offers that should explain why the Arab states today refuse to continue mortgaging their national interest to the Palestinian cause,\u201d Ben-Ami wrote. \u201cAnd today, the only peace deal that is on the table is the sham state offered by Trump\u2019s peace plan.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Erekat did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p> <p><span>Erekat\u2019s arrival to Harvard has not come without controversy. A Monday editorial from the New York Post claims that Harvard received a $2 million donation from the Palestinian Authority, which indirectly comes from American tax dollars through foreign aid.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy School spokesperson James F. Smith wrote in an emailed statement that the claims made by the New York Post were false.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard did not receive $2 million in donations from the Palestinian Authority,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe Kennedy School received a $150 000.00 gift from the Palestinian Monetary Authority in 2011 to establish an annual Graduate Public Service Fellowship to support a student from the occupied Palestinian territories for three years, through 2013.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Kennedy School has received individual donations from Bashar Masri, a Palestinian businessman best known for building a major planned city in the West Bank,\u201d he added. \u201cThese donations also fund fellowships for Palestinian students attending the School.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>StandWithUs, a nonpartisan Israeli education organization, also condemned Harvard\u2019s decision to extend the fellowship to Erekat, citing his past statements as a Palestinian official against Israel. He once said he would \u201cnever recognize Israel as a Jewish state.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Smith wrote the Kennedy School seeks to bring \u201cdiverse perspectives\u201d to its campus. He noted that last year\u2019s Fisher Family Fellow was Tzipi Livni, a former Israeli foreign minister.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Kennedy School is committed to bringing diverse perspectives to our community as part of our academic mission,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis fellowship appointment is consistent with that goal.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Raquel Coronell Uribe can be reached at raquel.coronelluribe@thecrimson.com.

{"title": "DOJ Issues Discrimination Findings Against Yale Amid Harvard Admissions Investigation, Lawsuit | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Benjamin L. Fu", "body": "<p><span>The United States Department of Justice alleged Yale University discriminates against Asian American and white applicants, a finding experts say goes hand in hand with simultaneous challenges to Harvard\u2019s race-conscious admissions process.</span></p> <p><span>The Justice Department\u2019s Thursday <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-finds-yale-illegally-discriminates-against-asians-and-whites-undergraduate\">press release</a> alleged that Yale weights race unfairly in its admissions process and has actively used race in a way that has disadvantaged Asian American and white applicants from 2000 to 2017.</span></p> <p><span>The Justice Department has also been conducting parallel investigations into race-conscious admissions at several universities. An investigation into Harvard admissions was <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/18/foia-doj-continues-investigation/\">ongoing</a> as of December 2019, according to a Freedom of Information Act Request filed by The Crimson. Separately, the Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/8/30/doj-harvard-unlawful/\">has backed</a> anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions in its lawsuit against Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>University of New Mexico law professor Vinay Harpalani said he believed Yale administrators would look to the example of Harvard\u2019s trial lawyer as they prepare to defend their own admissions process.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI see the defenses as kind of synergistic,\u201d Harpalani said. \u201cI do see Yale looking to Harvard, in terms of the model for how to defend this, just looking at everything Harvard did with <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/11/2/faust-testifies-in-admissions-trial/\">the expert witnesses</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/11/13/admissions-data/\">the data</a> that they used and the arguments they presented.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Yale quickly defended its admissions process in its own statement Thursday, calling the Justice Department\u2019s allegations \u201cbaseless.\u201d Yale President Peter Salovey additionally stated that the University would continue to consider race in its admissions process and reiterated Yale\u2019s commitment to diversity in its student body. The Justice Department sent a letter to Yale threatening a lawsuit if the University does not suspend the consideration of race in admissions.</span></p> <p><span>A political nonprofit, the Asian American Coalition for Education, joined dozens of other advocacy groups to file civil rights complaints against Harvard in 2015 and Yale, Dartmouth, and Brown in 2016. Swan Lee, a co-founder of AACE, said she believes a Justice Department lawsuit is necessary to hold Yale and other universities accountable.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf it really goes to that step, I think it will be good for the transparency of the quality of admissions,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIn a lawsuit, Yale probably has to provide its internal admission data so that the scholars can analyze it and examine it. So having this data will be very valuable for Americans to know what is going on in admissions.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Justice Department\u2019s findings against Yale come shortly before the First Circuit Court of Appeals is set to reconsider an October 2019 <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/3/admissions-decision-explained/\">district court decision</a> which upheld Harvard\u2019s admissions process. The Justice Department was among the organizations to submit amicus briefs calling for the appeals court to overturn <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/27/doj-amicus-brief-admissions/\">Harvard\u2019s system</a> and government attorneys will present an oral argument opposing the University\u2019s practices</span></p> <p><span>Samuel R. Bagenstos, a law professor at the University of Michigan who formerly worked in the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, said that, though Harvard and Yale are facing separate legal challenges, the two cases represent broader opposition to affirmative action at universities nationwide.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Harvard case is in front of the First Circuit Court of Appeals right now and they're going to make a decision about that case. The Yale case is a separate case; it's even in a different circuit,\u201d Bagenstos said. \u201cSo they'll proceed separately. But I think the way to think about them is they're part of the same agenda challenging affirmative action in elite education.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bagenstos also said he believes that the Justice Department\u2019s decision is an especially strategic move in light of the upcoming 2020 presidential election.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat you're likely to see over the next several months \u2014 and even after November, if Trump loses \u2014 is a real acceleration of issuing findings, letters, filing lawsuits, and taking other actions that are designed to force a Biden administration to live with the priorities of the Trump administration,\u201d Bagenstos said.</span></p> <p><span>Harpalani also said the Justice Department\u2019s timing seemed strategic and added that he believes the Justice Department would have a significantly different approach under presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden\u2019s leadership.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t know if the Yale lawsuit is going to go very far if Trump loses the election,\u201d Harpalani said. \u201cI think it would be a complete reversal. I think the DOJ would actually defend race-conscious policies.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Benjamin L. Fu can be reached at benjamin.fu@thecrimson.com.

As of Wednesday, the Boston Restaurant Group listed the restaurant for sale for $475,000.</span></p> <p><span>Bartley started working at his family\u2019s restaurant when he was 13. During his tenure, the restaurant has been featured on TV shows like the \u201cRachael Ray Show\u201d and \u201cDiners, Drive-Ins and Dives,\u201d and has accrued high-profile customers like actress Mindy Kaling. Now, Bartley said, it is time for him to retire.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m 60 years old; the restaurant is 60 years old; we\u2019re the same age,\u201d he said in a Monday interview. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed through the years [restaurateurs] all stay too long...We should have sold it years ago.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bartley added that his retirement is unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Bartley\u2019s Burger Cottage remains temporarily closed due to pandemic concerns, though Bartley plans to reopen the restaurant the second week of September.</span></p> <p><span>Bartley said he\u2019s had some potential buyers surface since putting it up for sale. One \u201creally good customer,\u201d B. J. Novak \u201901, the former executive producer of \u201cThe Office,\u201d called him to express interest in the restaurant, according to Bartley.</span></p> <p><span>For nearly 50 years, Harvard has owned Bartley\u2019s and the adjacent Harvard Book Store. In 2019, rising rents triggered a tense negotiation over a new lease between Bartley\u2019s and Harvard which <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/14/rent-too-damn-high/\">nearly forced</a> the burger shop to move from its iconic location.</span></p> <p><span>Famous for its cheekily named menu items, Mr. Bartley\u2019s recently served a \u201cGreedy Landlords\u201d burger amid a wave of Harvard Square closings. Still, Bartley said Monday that he wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep his location open without his \u201cgreat\u201d landlords.</span></p> <p><span>Bartley\u2019s is not the first Harvard Square landmark set to change hands this year. It comes on the heels of a string of Harvard Square business <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/6/26/pandemic-forces-harvard-square-businesses-to-close/\">closures</a> due to the ensuing economic downturn as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.</span></p> <p><span>Ned Ver Planck, owner of Dickson Bros. \u2014 a Harvard Square hardware store established in 1943 \u2014 has plans to retire. Caf\u00e9 Pamplona, which opened in 1958, will also close, according to owner Nina S. Hovagimian \u2014 though she said in late June that she hopes someone else will take over the cafe.</span></p> <p><span>Bartley said he hopes that a new owner can make improvements to the burger cottage, while keeping the brand and name intact.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt's not rocket science.

{"title": "The Language of \u201cMerit\u201d Divides Immigrants When We Most Need Solidarity | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>On April 20, President Donald J. Trump<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1252418369170501639\"> tweeted</a> that in light of the growing COVID-19 pandemic, he would \u201ctemporarily suspend immigration into the United States.\u201d As a recently graduated international student, I asked myself whether I should worry more about my health or my visa status.</span></p> <p><span>On June 22, the President<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspending-entry-aliens-present-risk-u-s-labor-market-following-coronavirus-outbreak/\"> suspended</a> H-1B work visas for overseas applicants. My international friends and I anxiously texted each other with a shared sense that we had just dodged a bullet because we were not overseas, but we braced for what more might come. Then, on July 6, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement<a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/sevp-modifies-temporary-exemptions-nonimmigrant-students-taking-online-courses-during\"> released</a> new guidelines requiring international students to leave the country if their universities planned to hold classes online. Dozens of my foreign friends and family panicked, fearful of having to leave school indefinitely in the middle of a global pandemic.</span></p> <p><span>Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/7/8/harvard-mit-sue-immigration-authorities/\">lawsuits</a> from Harvard and MIT as well as several states, ICE <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/7/15/ice-lawsuit-policy-rescinded/\">reversed</a> its exclusionary policies on July 14. International students are safe for now. But we still fear that assaults on our visa status will come in waves, much like the pandemic itself.</span></p> <p><span>Precarity is nothing new to many immigrant groups in the United States. But for many under the F-1 student visa and H-1B worker visa, the assault on our status came as a shock. After all, international students<a href=\"https://educationdata.org/international-student-enrollment-statistics/\"> added</a> $40 billion to the U.S. economy in 2019 and created or supported nearly 460,000 jobs in the 2018-2019 school year. There was little economic and policy rationale to target us.</span></p> <p><span>Many of us may have felt we were secure because the Trump administration<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/president-trumps-bold-immigration-plan-21st-century/\"> unveiled</a> a plan last year to prioritize \u201cmerit-based\u201d immigration over family-based \u201cchain migration.\u201d This kind of system would give preference to highly-educated, younger, English-speaking immigrants. Unsurprisingly, the immigrants that would get preference may support these merit-based policies more.</span></p> <p><span>But as more recent policies have made clear, it is a false assumption among many international students at elite universities and high-income immigrants that our visa status is meaningfully \u201cdifferent\u201d from those under Temporary Protected Status, asylum, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival, or those who are undocumented. The word \u201cdifferent\u201d betrays an assumption that our education and professions make us uniquely meritorious and deserving. \u201cDifferent\u201d may also veil racism and xenophobia toward immigrants from certain countries. For example, many of us may not have acted at the outset of the \u201cMuslim ban\u201d in 2017, when President Trump signed an executive order barring entry of people from seven Muslim-majority countries.</span></p> <p><span>The language of \u201cdifference\u201d in immigration is costly. It has allowed many to remain silent even in the face of inhumane and predatory immigration enforcement against certain racial and working-class groups.</span></p> <p><span>It is time to reframe our immigration narrative. All of us face the threat of xenophobia. All of us feel like pawns in political games. Therefore, all of us need to fight for each other.</span></p> <p><span>As a Nepali, I can see that true immigration justice requires solidarities across different immigration categories. Nepal is a small South Asian country of just 28 million people, but the Nepali community has traveled all immigration pathways. Nepal has <a href=\"https://www.nepalitimes.com/latest/us-visa-rule-leaves-nepali-students-in-lurch/\">more than 13,000</a> college students in the United States,<a href=\"https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-temporary-protected-status/\"> nearly 9,000</a> workers under TPS and, since 2008,<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2017AnnualReport/FY17AnnualReport-TableVII.pdf\"> more than 26,500</a> permanent residents with Diversity Immigrant Visas, a category that grants residency to people from underrepresented countries. I know Nepalis who have degrees from the country\u2019s top universities; those who are doctors at the frontlines of COVID-19; others who got a Diversity Visa and reunited with loved ones after years of living apart; and students who have worked multiple jobs to afford out-of-state tuition that ultimately subsidize costs for their American peers. No matter what our pathway to this country, all of us have relied on the promise of America.</span></p> <p><span>Students are privileged that states and universities mobilized on their behalf. But more is at stake. The U.S. government has<a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/15/2020-12575/procedures-for-asylum-and-withholding-of-removal-credible-fear-and-reasonable-fear-review\"> proposed</a> new definitions and procedures for asylum-seekers that would effectively end the status for all but very few. Only one day after the Supreme Court protected DACA under narrow grounds, President Trump<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1273967323901317120?s=20\"> signaled</a> that he might attempt to terminate it again. The future of TPS is also uncertain, with an<a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/update-ramos-v-nielsen\"> appeal</a> pending in the Ninth Circuit and a<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6)\"> stagnant bill</a> that could provide TPS holders with an opportunity for permanent residency. We must mobilize in support of those who don\u2019t have universities and employers behind them.</span></p> <p><span>Let us not use our privileges as international students or high-skilled workers to further entrench the immigration hierarchy. Let us rethink our toleration of a punitive immigration system. This administration is dividing us. It is time we build solidarities instead \u2014 across class and borders.</span></p> <p><span><em>Sabrina Singh is a graduate of Harvard Law School.</em></span></p>"}

After ICE Victory, More Battles Await | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "The Crimson Editorial Board", "body": "<p><span>For all the tragic political farce of the last three years, the Trump Administration\u2019s creeping descent into authoritarianism \u2014 a thinly-veiled <a href=\"https://www.aclu-wa.org/pages/timeline-muslim-ban\">Muslim ban</a>, literally <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/news/2020/06/17/family-separation-under-trump-administration-timeline\">caging children</a>, and militarized federal agents <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/news/article/federal-law-enforcement-unmarked-vehicles-portland-protesters/\">dispersing protests</a> in violation of a state\u2019s express wishes, to name a few \u2014 is perhaps best understood through its gradual efforts to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/us/salvadorans-tps-end.html\">dislodge</a> more and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/506018-trump-expected-to-refile-paperwork-to-end-daca-this-week\">more</a> immigrants, including those arriving <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/trump-immigration-plan-lopsided-proposal\">legally</a>, and to maximize the political payout of their <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/24/world/americas/migrant-caravan-trump.html\">mistreatment</a>.</span></p> <p><span>For students, these efforts hit close to home when the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/sevp-modifies-temporary-exemptions-nonimmigrant-students-taking-online-courses-during\">guidance</a> barring international students from enrolling in universities offering only courses online.</span></p> <p><span>To be clear: By designing an immigration order to punish both international students and educational institutions that have acted in accordance with the demands of public health, the Trump Administration has done nothing more than cudgel three of its favorite targets: immigrants, those who take seriously the threat of COVID-19, and institutions of higher learning. As University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in an email about ICE\u2019s new policy: \u201cThe order came down without notice\u2014its cruelty surpassed only by its recklessness.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And, thankfully, he responded in kind. Two weeks ago, Harvard and MIT filed a<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/7/8/harvard-mit-sue-immigration-authorities/\"> lawsuit</a> in the District Court in Boston against DHS and ICE arguing that ICE\u2019s rule was in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act because the agency had failed to take into account \u201cimportant aspects of the problem.\u201d The very fact that Harvard and the federal government find themselves in a serious war of words that escalated to a legal battle is a little surreal \u2014 a mark, perhaps, of strange and twisted times.</span></p> <p><span>But that makes it all the more significant. Evidently, the universities were speaking to a strong need within their communities and beyond to fight back against the Trump administration \u2014 drawing support from dozens of peer institutions, cities, states, and student organizations, including through<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/7/13/harvard-mit-ice-lawsuit-amici/\"> amicus briefs</a>.</span></p> <p><span>As Harvard students, it is deeply empowering and gratifying to see our institution stand up for our international peers and, in a broader sense, for democracy and civil society. Democracy requires public dissent when authoritarianism threatens. Protest, journalistic truth-seeking, and legal action are among the key safeguards of our democracy.</span></p> <p><span>On Tuesday, just eight days after the initial announcement and before U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs could herself issue an injunction, those buttresses proved themselves strong. Minutes into a hearing, DHS and ICE<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/7/15/ice-lawsuit-policy-rescinded/\"> withdrew</a> their proposed guidelines. The government\u2019s retreat shows the vital role academic institutions can play in marshalling those forces of democratic resistance.</span></p> <p><span>But Harvard doesn\u2019t always come to bat when students and society need it to. A quick look at recent emails from Bacow makes that all too clear. Whereas the wording of his email denouncing the Trump administration\u2019s attack on international students was direct, unequivocal, and action-oriented, <a href=\"http://links.repoint.harvard.edu/servlet/MailView?ms=MzIyMzU0NTYS1&amp;r=MjA4NDQyNjEzMTM3S0&amp;j=MTcwNDI4OTA3NAS2&amp;mt=1&amp;rt=0\">his response</a> to the Black Lives Matter protests last month was the opposite. We called it \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/6/5/editorial-how-harvard-must-combat-systemic-racism/\">self-indulgent musing</a>.\u201d An op-ed contributor raised the stakes further. To Bacow, she <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/6/5/donella-what-bacow-should-have-written/\">charged</a>, \u201cAdmit candidly the ways Harvard has failed during its long history to promote for everyone the American dream you believe in, and the ways you intend to use your position to fix that right now.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Over the last two weeks, on behalf of international students, Bacow has done exactly that. But in some sense he has set himself up. The world knows now that Harvard, under Bacow\u2019s leadership, is capable of genuine and decisive moral leadership. And as a result we will come to demand more of it and him \u2014 on behalf of immigrants and dreamers, Black and Indigenous students, victims of sexual violence, and the many others who will continue to face the malice of a corrupt administration.</span></p> <p><span><em>This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board.

Isselbacher", "body": "<p><span><strong>UPDATED: July 10, 2020, 5:39 p.m.</strong></span></p> <p><span>Abdullah M. Bannan \u201923, a Syrian Harvard student, took a circuitous route to campus his freshman year. He drove from Syria to Lebanon, then flew to Italy, and finally transferred to the U.S. \u2014 a 30-hour trip in total.</span></p> <p><span>He has not returned home to Syria since, and an obstacle course of <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/6/16/international-student-survey/\">closed borders and travel restrictions</a> will prevent him from doing so anytime soon.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cGoing to Europe is virtually impossible for me now due to travel restrictions, and definitely not to Lebanon because Lebanon is not letting anyone into their country, except for Lebanese people,\u201d Bannan said. \u201cThen the problem that comes after that is going from Lebanon to Syria, because Syria\u2019s borders are also closed.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Harvard\u2019s all-remote fall plan and new government rules may also make it equally challenging for him to remain in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>Hours after Harvard announced Monday morning that <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/7/6/harvard-college-coronavirus-fall-plans/\">all its courses will be virtual</a>, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released an order barring international students enrolled in <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/7/7/harvard-reax-ice-international-student-guidelines/\">universities offering only online courses</a> from staying in the United States.</span></p> <p><span>Many international undergraduates said they met the news with fear, anxiety, and grief over a profound loss of stability. Harvard and MIT have since challenged the rule in <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/7/8/harvard-mit-sue-immigration-authorities/\">a lawsuit</a> filed in District Court in Boston Wednesday morning.</span></p> <p><span>During the town hall for international students, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said the guidelines have put universities in a bind, one where they must decide between prioritizing the health and safety of its affiliates and supporting their international students. He called the dilemma a \u201cSophie\u2019s Choice\u201d situation, referencing a 1982 film in which a woman must choose which of her children to send to gas chambers in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span>Khurana promised town hall attendees, however, that Harvard\u2019s senior administrators have dedicated their attention to the success of Harvard\u2019s lawsuit against DHS and ICE.</span></p> <p><span>Maureen Martin, who directs Immigration Services at the Harvard International Office, said at the town hall that while Harvard must await the results of the lawsuit before giving further guidance, the guidelines permit students currently in the U.S. to remain stateside through the summer.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAt the moment, you don't need to start packing and get a flight out this week,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is such a rapidly evolving situation at the moment that we can't really give you a date by which you'd have to leave the U.S. and hopefully, we are going to prevail in court and it won\u2019t come to you leaving the U.S.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Since Monday, many international students said the federal rule and Harvard\u2019s fall plan have upended their plans for the near future.</span></p> <p><span>Estela L. Franca \u201923, who hails from Brazil, was staying a few minutes from campus in Brookline, Mass. when she received news of the federal order via text.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was a very dramatic day,\u201d Franca said, describing how her morning began with Bacow\u2019s 11 a.m. missive and the realization she and her fellow sophomores would not return to campus in the fall.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI tried to start figuring out what I was going to do, whether I wanted to go to Brazil, whether I wanted to stay and live with friends somewhere \u2014 that had been the plan all along. And then three hours later, I received a text with the new ICE guidelines, and that kind of shifted everything,\u201d she added.</span></p> <p><span>The federal decision in particular has affected Franca, she said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEvery hour of my life since then has revolved around the situation with the new ICE ruling,\u201d she continued. \u201cOn Monday, I cried for hours, just because it didn't seem like there was going to be any way around it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>If Harvard\u2019s lawsuit fails in court, Franca said she would return to Brazil and take her courses from afar. She said she is not considering taking a leave of absence because she does not want to deactivate her visa status by declining to take classes for more than five months.</span></p> <p><span>During Wednesday\u2019s town hall, Martin said students who take a leave of absence would have to forego their F1 visa status and complete another I-20 form upon their return. She said, however, that students would not need an F1 to complete their studies remotely since the visa is only required to enter the country, not to enroll in classes.</span></p> <p><span>For some international students still living in the U.S., however, both staying in the U.S. and returning home appear untenable.</span></p> <p><span>Tuzo Mulunda \u201923, an international student from Kenya who has been living on campus since March, said she is unable to return home because Kenya\u2019s borders remain closed.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI would have to leave the U.S. but the thing is, I literally cannot get a flight to my country because it's still on lockdown,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I'm stuck in this place where we have to leave. But even if I wanted to, I literally cannot.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bannan, subject to deportation from the U.S. and simultaneously unable to return to Syria, is in the same predicament. Even if he were able to go home, his departure from the U.S. would jeopardize his eventual return to campus due to the Trump administration\u2019s executive order in 2017 banning travel from several mostly Muslim countries, including Syria.</span></p> <p><span>He added that completing his studies in Syria would be impossible because the country has banned Zoom. Because current U.S. sanctions on Syria prohibit economic transactions and services, which may include educational services, he fears he may have to withdraw as a Harvard student lest the University face prosecution.</span></p> <p><span>Mulunda and Bannan both said they intended to petition to remain on campus in the fall semester to take their online classes in Cambridge. The current guidelines, however, have dashed those expectations.</span></p> <p><span>Justas Jasevicius \u201921, who is currently at home in Lithuania, also said he hoped to stay with his blockmates in a Boston apartment for the semester. The federal order complicated his plan, which was already temporarily thwarted by the Trump administration\u2019s ban on travel from nearly all European countries.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m happy that Harvard is doing something. I just really hope they're prepared for a negative answer from the courts,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Several universities, including Columbia University, have decided to circumvent the federal order by committing to create a hybrid program with in-person and remote learning opportunities through which international students could attend occasional in-person class meetings to avoid deportation.</span></p> <p><span>In response to student questions about the possibility of a hybrid model in the fall, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh said during the town hall that Harvard is still \u201ccommitted\u201d to its decision to conduct all classes remotely next semester.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe thought very hard about this for a very long time, and this is what we think is the best, so we are confident or hopeful at least that we will get relief in court,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>Jasevicius said he was happy to hear many deans and professors offering to teach in-person classes for international students should Harvard resort to a hybrid model like other schools. Still, he said, such a model may not offer students recourse because of travel restrictions.</span></p> <p><span>Barbara A. Oedayrajsingh Varma \u201921, who is from the Netherlands, also said she worried a hybrid model would force international students unable to leave their country due to travel restrictions or health concerns to unenroll.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA hybrid model might mean that students outside the U.S. will be forced to unenroll. But if there\u2019s no hybrid model, students inside the U.S. will be forced to leave, which may not be possible,\u201d Oedayrajsingh Varma said.</span></p> <p><span>Fabrizio Serafini \u201923 said the federal order is forcing him to take his classes at home in Italy, where he and other international students have discussed plans to forge a makeshift Harvard microcosm far away from campus. But the disruption still worries him, he added.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt's this feeling that you don't know what's gonna happen the next year, and you cannot be happy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot be sure of how your future is gonna look because you don\u2019t know where you're going to be. You don't know whether you will have the chance to finish your education in the United States.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Like Serafini, Franca described the uncertainty as overwhelming.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI've been in the country for five years, always on an F1. And it's always been a looming threat that if something happens, they could take it away,\u201d Franca said.  \u201cThis has always been a threat in the back of our minds because what guarantees us staying in the country is the stamp on our passport and the I-20 papers.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is almost like a nightmare situation,\u201d she added. \u201cIt's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen and then it happens.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Juliet E. Isselbacher can be reached at juliet.isselbacher@thecrimson.com.

{"title": "Experts Link Harvard ICE Lawsuit to Recent SCOTUS Precedents on Procedural Issues | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Camille G. Caldera", "body": "<p><span>A lawsuit Harvard and MIT filed against the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Wednesday is a major step into existing legal battles over immigration and executive action, experts say.</span></p> <p><span>The suit is centered on the Administrative Procedure Act, a law specifying the process federal agencies must follow when they create and issue regulations that has been at the heart of two recent Supreme Court cases.</span></p> <p><span>Its first and second counts allege that the new rules \u2014 which bar international students attending colleges and universities offering online-only courses from residing in the United States were \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d because they failed to \u201cconsider important aspects of the problem\u201d and failed to \u201coffer any reasoned basis that could justify the policy.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>City University of New York Law School Professor Natalie M. Gomez-Velez said legal precedent requires an agency to \u201cexamine relevant data\u201d and \u201carticulate a satisfactory explanation for its action, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made\u201d in order to prove it acted within reason.</span></p> <p><span>Gomez-Velez said she believes that DHS and ICE failed to do so when it announced the policy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe pandemic is still going on, and we're actually at a really critical point. There doesn't seem to be any rationale for changing direction with respect to those temporary exemptions,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat's a reasonable explanation for doing this? I haven't heard one.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The universities\u2019 third count asserts that the directive violates the requirement to provide a notice and comment period prior to rulemaking.</span></p> <p><span>Gomez-Velez said she agrees that the guidance also \u201cdirectly violates\u201d the APA\u2019s notice and comment requirement \u2014 and though there are exceptions, such as emergencies or \u201cgood cause,\u201d she said she thinks they do not apply.</span></p> <p><span>University of Chicago Law School Professor Jennifer Nou wrote in an email that the lawsuit\u2019s claims are the \u201cbread-and-butter of APA-based lawsuits.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>However, Nou noted that a potential argument against the suit is that it was filed \u201ctoo early,\u201d since the guidelines issued on Monday were a \u201cbroadcast message\u201d rather than a \u201cfinal\u201d agency action. The APA only applies to final actions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cICE will later publish a temporary final rule in the Federal Register, which will likely lay out the same policy,\u201d Nou wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the temporary final rule will contain more justification for the change than the broadcast message did; in that case, many of the current lawsuit\u2019s arguments may have to be revised.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Gomez-Velez agreed that DHS and ICE may question the validity of the suit based on the unofficial status of the guidelines, though she believes they should be subject to review.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt looks like a final rule and it looks like the kind of rule that would be subject to judicial review,\u201d she said, citing that it included \u201cvery specific dates and requirements for universities\u201d and threatened students with removal from the country.</span></p> <p><span>The case has been assigned to federal judge Allison D. Burroughs, who previously ruled on cases pertaining both to Harvard and to the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies.</span></p> <p><span>In October 2019, Burroughs <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/2/admissions-suit-decision/\">ruled in favor of Harvard</a> in its ongoing affirmative action lawsuit against Students for Fair Admissions. Two years earlier, she ruled against President Donald Trump\u2019s initial travel ban that barred citizens of predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.</span></p> <p><span>The lawsuit \u2014 which has since expanded to include Northeastern University and attracted attention from universities across the nation \u2014 seeks a temporary restraining order and both a preliminary and permanent halt to the new policy.</span></p> <p><span>According to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a temporary restraining order may be issued without notice to ICE and is capped at 10 days, while a preliminary injunction requires notice and could last until the trial on the merits occurs.</span></p> <p><span>The scope of the injunction, though, could also be in contention, creating an \u201cuncertain situation\u201d for the thousands of international students impacted.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf they succeed in court in getting the preliminary injunction to stop the agency from doing this, a couple of other questions are around whether or not that injunction can be applied nationwide,\u201d Gomez-Velez said. \u201cIf an injunction is issued by this court, whether there will be appeals, whether it goes all the way to the Supreme Court \u2014 what's the timeframe?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In a 5-4 ruling last month, the Supreme Court blocked an attempt to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals on the grounds that the Trump administration failed to provide adequate reason to end the program. And in a 5-4 ruling in June 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that the Department of Commerce could not add a question about citizenship to the 2020 Census, again because it failed to meet criteria for reasoned decision-making.</span></p> <p><span>Challenges to agency actions alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act have become increasingly common in the Trump era, in part because of the administration\u2019s penchant for rapid and drastic action.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is one of many Administrative Procedure Act cases precisely because this administration has been engaging in the agency actions that are that are an about-face, or that introduce policies without real explanation, that really have an impact on people in ways that they really have failed to explain, or aren't supported by the facts,\u201d Gomez-Velez said.</span></p> <p><span>One downside to cases based on violations of the APA, though, is that even if the court rules against an agency, it can alter its procedures and take the action again, Gomez-Velez said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe downside of it is, if there is a determination that is arbitrary and capricious for failure to explain, the agency always could go back and explain,\u201d she said. \u201cOr for failure to go through and comment rulemaking, the agency can go back and go through notice and comment, and then move forward with the policy anyway.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In fact, Trump is expected to employ that strategy later this week with a second attempt to end DACA.</span></p> <p><span>Even without immediate or satisfactory legal resolution, though, Nou wrote that there may be other reasons Harvard and MIT filed the suit.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFor starters, the lawsuit has a lot of expressive value and raises many points that the public may not have otherwise known; for example, the magnitude of the burdens placed on international students, the value that international students have in the academic community and at large,\u201d Nou wrote. \u201cAll of these points may help sway the court of popular opinion, which could result in political blowback for the White House.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Camille G.

{"title": "Fall 2020: 100 Percent Online, 40 Percent Residential, 0 Percent Certain | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "The Crimson Editorial Board", "body": "<p><span>This week \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/11/editorial-harvard-stops-world-cannot/\">118 anxious days</a> after Harvard ordered its students leave campus mid-semester \u2014 the College made its long-awaited announcement <a href=\"https://www.fas.harvard.edu/fas-decision-2020-2021-academic-year\">detailing</a> how the 2020-2021 academic year will unfold.</span></p> <p><span>One hundred percent online classes. Zero percent tuition reduction. Forty percent density in residence, with housing only guaranteed for freshmen. For them, plus the upperclassmen who manage to successfully petition for on-campus housing, alien and isolated living conditions await, marked by the prospect of three solitary bagged meals per day and two mandatory COVID tests per week. The only social spaces left open on campus? Laundry rooms.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard\u2019s cautious roadmap for reopening amid America\u2019s surging coronavirus outbreak \u2014 guided by an evidence-based and expert-led risk management approach \u2014 stands in stark contrast to the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/politics/donald-trump-coronavirus-indifference/index.html\">denialist</a> narrative coming from the executive branch of the federal government. Its playbook has been to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/world/coronavirus-updates.html#link-7e915376\">downplay</a> the pandemic\u2019s spread, despite Friday <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/10/coronavirus-live-updates-us/\">marking</a> a record high of new daily coronavirus cases and eight states setting records for daily coronavirus deaths this week, and to bully schools into reopening with international students as the bargaining chip.</span></p> <p><span>President Donald Trump himself <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/7/8/trump-harvard-coronavirus-fall-criticism/\">called</a> Harvard\u2019s plan \u201cridiculous.\u201d We disagree.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard\u2019s decision to limit the number of undergraduate students on campus and to instigate strict social distancing and public health precautions for the 40 percent who do return is a responsible one. These high-level choices reflect a broader belief in the value of public health and safety \u2014 and more fundamentally, of human life  \u2014 that we share. They also reflect a belief in making decisions that are grounded in evidence, even when the evidence doesn\u2019t make us feel great.</span></p> <p><span>Our trust that Harvard\u2019s decision will protect our community\u2019s health and safety doesn\u2019t make its impact any less heartbreaking. Something serious is being lost here: The college experience we imagined pre-pandemic is gone. This journey we set out on together no longer feels shared, as class-years become splintered by geography, time zones, and an anticipated avalanche of leaves of absence.</span></p> <p><span>To our classmates: This sucks so much. We miss you. But the situation we find ourselves in isn\u2019t Harvard\u2019s doing. Reprehensible federal governance is entirely to blame.</span></p> <p><span>Still, doing better than the Trump administration definitely doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing great. Despite its <a href=\"https://www.fas.harvard.edu/fas-decision-2020-2021-academic-year\">stated</a> commitment to transparent communication, the College\u2019s initial rollout of its reopening plan has been confusing and left many questions unanswered.</span></p> <p><span>What will life on campus look like for the 40 percent of undergraduates on campus? Will they be able to interact with \u2026 anyone? Administrators floated limited social <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/6/27/fall-focus-groups-feedback/\">\u201cpods\u201d</a> of 10 to 15 students, but in the College\u2019s bare bones and dystopian <a href=\"https://dso.college.harvard.edu/files/dso/files/community_compact-6_5_20.pdf\">Residential Community Compact</a>, they are nowhere to be found. With the deadline to petition for on-campus housing Monday, we\u2019re still left wondering what campus life will look like \u2014 what traditions, joys, and degree of social interaction will remain.</span></p> <p><span>And of perhaps equal significance, Harvard needs to ensure that students taking time off \u2014 especially low-income and international students \u2014 have a place on campus to return to. Despite the logistical difficulties, Harvard needs to make good on its four-year residential promise.</span></p> <p><span>How will academics work? The College recently <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/7/10/harvard-fall-academics-reactions/\">mandated</a> two to four hours of live interaction per week, per course regardless of the timezone \u2014 how this will play out around the world is anyone\u2019s guess. Classes requiring hands-on learning will have to be transfigured, if possible, to an online setting. Pre-registration, the norm for most other schools, is now required for the first time at Harvard. How will these new changes affect course offerings and experience?</span></p> <p><span>Why charge full tuition? This decision implies that the entire Harvard experience \u2014 or at least the parts worth paying for \u2014 can be replicated in full on a laptop, sending a striking message about what Harvard believes to be the value of the education it provides. What are we paying for: the experience or the brand?</span></p> <p><span>And what of the cost of living? \u201cObviously,\u201d as Harvard\u2019s top administrators put it, no one living off-campus will be paying for room and board. But the $5,000 the College will award students receiving financial aid \u2014 full or partial \u2014 seems deeply insufficient.  It\u2019s better this allowance exists than not, but it will significantly disincentivize both moving on-campus and taking time off for students who, amid mass unemployment and a recession, need the cash but might benefit from either of those options. Moreover, why isn\u2019t this allowance distributed according to the degree of student\u2019s financial aid?</span></p> <p><span>Likewise, the emergency satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system has been abandoned \u2014 but have the concerns that brought this grading system about gone away? Not really. How can students \u2014 or even faculty for that matter \u2014 be sure that the fall\u2019s Zoom classes will really be all that much smoother than the spring\u2019s? And why does the University presume the personal and socioeconomic issues that troubled many students in the spring have suddenly disappeared?</span></p> <p><span>How will campus mental health services adapt to provide online services, with demand likely to increase as the stress and disorder of pandemic life carries on without pause? That can\u2019t be an afterthought. Every passing day of this global crisis makes it an ever more pressing concern.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard shared its plans with only a month to go until shopping week. Presumably, the College needed time to iron out a comprehensive reopening plan and make a decision up-to-date with public health realities. Why, then, after so many weeks of waiting, are students still having to track down answers to obvious questions?</span></p> <p><span>We\u2019re grateful for Harvard\u2019s caution when it comes to public health, but student life concerns \u2014 now spread across the globe \u2014 require the same rigorous consideration.</span></p> <p><span><em>This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board.

After decades of going relatively unnoticed, the argument went, his polarizing election would push sidelined protest art into the mainstream. The months and years that followed helped validate that argument in multiple ways: late-night comedians found new audiences through <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/11/08/when-americans-watch-late-night-comedy-the-jokes-on-donald-trump/\">more political humor</a>, stories of government oppression like \u201c1984\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/books/1984-george-orwell-donald-trump.html\">came back in vogue</a>, and shocking pieces of art denouncing Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/14/entertainment/snoop-dogg-donald-trump-video/index.html\">made headlines</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/arts/trump-kathy-griffin.html\">stirred controversy</a>. To some, it seemed like Trump redefined the zeitgeist overnight.</span></p> <p><span>But the story is more complicated than just one election. Art in reaction to Trump is certainly everywhere; still, sometimes it takes flashpoint cultural moments to bring that existing work to the forefront of our minds.</span></p> <p><span>Enter Algiers. The Atlanta band fronted by Franklin James Fisher released its third studio album, \u201cThere Is No Year,\u201d on Jan. 17, but the album failed to chart in every country but Germany. While the band had by then eclipsed one million plays on Spotify with some cuts from their self-titled debut and 2017\u2019s \u201cThe Underside of Power,\u201d none of this album\u2019s tracks have received the same attention. Mixed reviews from <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/algiers-there-is-no-year/\">Pitchfork</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwmawu1TD9M\">The Needle Drop</a> suggested the album failed to leave a lasting impression on listeners. This critique seemed accurate before the events following the horrific murder of George Floyd at the hand of Minneapolis police officers.</span></p> <p><span>Algiers bring a sound to \u201cThere Is No Year\u201d that is less consistently hard but more varied than \u201cThe Underside of Power.\u201d \u201cWait For The Sound\u201d illustrates this dichotomy well. Similar to their debut's remarkable \u201cBlood,\u201d the track's beat consistently builds throughout the run time, refusing to relent. \"Blood\" focuses on the constricting, generational impact of slavery and oppression. As such, the song never lets Fisher escape its beat. His emotional final verse still falls in line with the backing track, which then continues for a full minute after that last verse has stopped. But where \"Blood\" never fully boils over, \"Wait For The Sound\" eventually repositions itself behind Fisher's cathartic vocals, creating an emotional outro that ends as soon as Fisher's cries stop. Other songs \u2014 such as \"Hour of the Furnaces\" \u2014 take inspiration from \"The Underside of Power\" closer \"The Cycle / The Spiral: Time to Go Down Slowly\" by experimenting with layered vocals and larger soundscapes. As a whole, the album feels much funkier than their past efforts, and songs like \"Chaka\" display a band that's both confident and introspective.</span></p> <p><span>As indicated by the album art \u2014 which depicts the letters of Algiers tumbling over a picture of a falling man \u2014 \u201cThere Is No Year\u201d deals with a world in freefall. Fisher\u2019s lyricism shines here, by bringing an unparalleled sense of urgency to his message. Indeed, Fisher's lyrics seem downright prophetic when listened to now, especially for listeners whose concern for racial injustice has arisen only recently. The very first words of the album \u2014 \u201cNow it\u2019s two minutes to midnight,\" off the titular track \u2014 warn of an imminent revolution. Fisher writes of a salient contrast between demonstrators and bystanders. The \u201cStreets are raining fire\u201d in \u201cWait For The Sound,\u201d but on the other side, \u201cHour Of The Furnaces\u201d depicts \u201cOutright denial / Of the dying and the sane.\u201d Fisher further explores this opposition to the movement in songs like \u201cLosing Is Ours,\u201d with lines like \u201cLet the sirens sing out their nightmare\u201d because \u201cThey\u2019ll be too in denial to know.\" The ultimate dagger to the resistance is indifference. The final words of the album, from \u201cNothing Bloomed,\u201d detail how \u201cEverything starts to fade under the weight of silence.\u201d It is hard to listen to these words and not be reminded of today's activists, whose main enemy is arguably the silence surrounding them.</span></p> <p><span>It is too simplistic to say \u201cThere Is No Year\u201d has a singular thesis \u2014 and it shouldn\u2019t have to \u2014 but the standout track \u201cDispossession\u201d is the album\u2019s closest thing to a mission statement. Sonically, the song\u2019s production is refined but invigorating, and the chorus\u2019s backing vocals make the tune undeniably catchy. The track\u2019s brilliance, though, lies in its message. Fisher acts as a harbinger of the coming revolution, telling the listener to \u201cRun around, run away from your America / While it burns in the streets / I been here standing on top of the mountain / Shouting down what I see.\u201d The larger message is not one of hope but rather the necessity of fighting back: \u201cEverybody wants to break down,\u201d he sings, but \u201cYou can\u2019t run away\u201d from the struggle. While the band explored similar themes over the course of \"The Underside of Power,\" \u201cDispossession\u201d hits on all of these themes at once. The song blends elements of unity: \u201cWe are the blade and the groove that come together\u201d; and force: \u201cWe are the rain of fire that\u2019s coming down.\u201d \u201cDispossession\u201d coalesces into a cohesive narrative of resistance, one that is so accurate that it has been used to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaldomejia/status/1267654078735298562\">caption photos of protestors</a>.</span></p> <p><span>Overall, \u201cThere Is No Year\u201d could not sound more relevant at this point in time. Critics myopically dismissed the album as <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/algiers-there-is-no-year/\">\u201cfrustratingly opaque,\u201d</a> as if they would have preferred a narrower, easier-to-digest rebuke of the Trump administration. Algiers leaves those rebukes for other artists for an important reason: The last few weeks have made disturbingly clear that societal problems, while greatly exacerbated by Trump, extend far beyond his reach. Fisher\u2019s cries for action can only be read within a broader history of Black activism and suffering. Protest art reflects both new problems and old, particularly now, as tentacles of hate that reach back into this country\u2019s roots threaten to suffocate it.</span></p> <p><span>While \u201cThere Is No Year\u201d is not an album for optimists, Fisher hopes out loud in \u201cDispossession\u201d that \u201cFreedom is coming soon.\u201d When is soon? Nobody knows. Until then, however, \u201cThere Is No Year\u201d deserves to be recognized as one of the most important albums of recent memory, the protest art the country needs to hear \u2014 not just in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death, but throughout the ongoing struggle for racial justice.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Jack M.

{"title": "Grad Union Reaches Contract With Harvard | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Davit Antonyan", "body": "<p><span>Bargaining teams for the University and its graduate student union reached a tentative one-year contract Monday, which they will now unanimously recommend to union members for ratification.</span></p> <p><span>The contract \u2014 the union\u2019s first \u2014 represents the outgrowth of a 19-month series of bargaining sessions between the two parties, punctuated by a <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/4/what-happened-strike-today/\">strike</a> in December.</span></p> <p><span>Graduate student workers at the University <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/4/21/union-vote-results/\">first voted to unionize</a> as Harvard Graduate Student Workers-United Automobile Workers in April 2018. The two sides began bargaining later that year in October.</span></p> <p><span>Since then, the union and the University remained at odds over three key areas: compensation, healthcare, and \u2014 most prominently \u2014 grievance procedures for discrimination and sexual harassment complaints.</span></p> <p><span>Though the tentative agreement does not fully meet each of the union\u2019s key asks, it does present a suitable fixture for the upcoming year as both sides endure the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, according to a summary of the contract posted to HGSU-UAW\u2019s website. The initial contract negotiations called for a three-year contract; however, given the financial strains of the pandemic, Harvard proposed shortening the agreement to a <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/5/6/hgsu-harvard-one-year-contract/\">one-year contract</a>, to take effect before the upcoming year.</span></p> <p><span>HGSU-UAW members now have the chance to ratify the contract, which would take effect on July 1, and last through June 30, 2021.  If ratified, the contract would be the first in University history to provide more than 4,000 student workers at Harvard with workplace protections.</span></p> <p><span>University Provost Alan M. Garber \u201976 announced the tentative agreement in an email to faculty members Monday evening. Garber wrote that the contract reflects the University\u2019s commitment to providing support for its graduate student workers.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOur students are the heart of our institution, and we have approached these negotiations with their best interests in mind,\u201d Garber wrote.</span></p> <p><span>According to the union\u2019s summary, the University agreed to grant student workers a 2.8 percent pay raise. Though HGSU-UAW representatives had initially hoped for a larger raise, the two parties had tentatively settled on the raise <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/5/28/hgsu-comprehensive-compromise/\">by the end of May</a>, shortly after Harvard modified the time span of the contract.</span></p> <p><span>Union members also secured a minimum wage of $16 per hour for non-salaried student workers and $17 per hour for students with hourly instructional roles. Salaried teaching assistants in professional schools will receive a pay raise up to $5,520 per section per semester, according to the union\u2019s website.</span></p> <p><span>Regarding health care, the University guaranteed union members up to $575,000 in funds to cover dental costs, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket expenses. The union also secured childcare subsidies via a new $350,000 fund.</span></p> <p><span>Previously, union members expressed concern with ensuring their safety amid the <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/5/27/commencement-2020-contracts/\">coronavirus pandemic</a>, given that many student employees will be returning to work as Harvard begins the <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/5/5/harvard-lab-reopening/\">phased reopening</a> of its labs. As such, the contract contains provisions that guarantee student workers personal protective equipment and protect employees from retaliation for reporting unsafe working conditions.</span></p> <p><span>Those provisions were the latest in a long list of provisions the two sides had accepted over the course of bargaining, including agreements over <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/10/HGSU-tentative-workload-coronavirus-bridge-year-letter/\">workload</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/11/HGSU-new-bargaining-agreements/\">holidays and vacation time, and parking and transportation</a>.</span></p> <p><span>The <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/4/25/union-non-discrimination-proposal/\">handling of non-discrimination and harassment procedures</a> formed a longstanding point of contention between HGSU-UAW and the University throughout negotiations: While the union argued that a third-party arbitrator should handle discrimination or harassment complaints, Harvard maintained that members could process these requests through internal University procedures.</span></p> <p><span>Despite other agreements in this area, the tentative contract does not include a third-party grievance procedure for discrimination and sexual harassment complaints. Under the agreement, students can elect to have a union representative present in \u201cany and all stages of discrimination or harassment complaints, regardless of the method of reporting.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The two sides agreed to guaranteed interim measures for all forms of harassment and discrimination complaints, and \u201cprotections against retaliation,\u201d per the summary. The University also \u201ccommitted to establishing new procedures and offices to address race-based discrimination and power-based harassment with the input of students and union representatives.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA working group will be assembled to accomplish this if the contract is ratified within 3 months of ratification,\u201d the summary on HGSU-UAW\u2019s website reads.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cComplaints of identity-based discrimination may not be arbitrated under the contract grievance article, but may be submitted to an internal appeals panel. While this is a start, it is insufficient beyond this one-year settlement in the context of the pandemic,\u201d it also states.</span></p> <p><span>According to Garber\u2019s email, union representatives will have seats on the University\u2019s existing Title IX Policy Review Committee \u2014 a body made up of faculty, students, and staff \u2014 and on two new committees to make recommendations on University policies for \u201caddressing other forms of discrimination and misconduct that do not fall under the federal Title IX regulations.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>HGSU-UAW representatives Lacey Rosey and Jeff Hall wrote in a press release that graduate students \u201cmade history\u201d by reaching the agreement.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cUnder the current circumstances, the tentative contract is being hailed by student workers as a major achievement,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt provides important protections and guarantees, and lays the groundwork to achieve even greater workplace rights and protections in future contracts.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The contract between HGSU-UAW and Harvard marks the latest development in unionization and bargaining efforts at private colleges across the nation, including Brown, Cornell, and Columbia. Members of Brown\u2019s Stand Up for Graduate Student Employees reached their first contract with administrators just two weeks prior, a first for the Ivy League.</span></p> <p><span>In a Monday press release, HGSU-UAW expressed support for other graduate workers across the country, writing that student workers\u2019 collective bargaining rights have been placed in jeopardy by President Donald Trump\u2019s conservative appointments to the National Labor Relations Board. The NLRB is responsible for enforcing and carrying out the National Labor Relations Act, which provides labor protections for workers.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis tentative contract agreement is a major victory not only for the Harvard Graduate Students Union (HGSU-UAW), but also for the graduate student worker movement across the country, especially in light of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to end the right of student workers\u2019 to bargain under federal law,\u201d the release reads.</span></p> <p><span>In February, HGSU-UAW previously alleged the University <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/25/hgsu-alleges-regressive-bargaining/\">engaged in \u201cregressive bargaining\u201d</a> and hid behind the Trump-appointed NLRB.</span></p> <p><span>Former NLRB Chairman William B. Gould IV wrote in an email that he believes HGSU-UAW\u2019s tentative contract could provide other universities the \u201ccourage to move ahead\u201d with bargaining despite \u201cTrump NLRB hostility.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Gould commended the University and the graduate union for coming to an agreement.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis important step forward is what collective bargaining is about and both sides are to be commended for it,\u201d Gould wrote. \u201cThe union has made a good start on both compensation and dispute resolution. The parties have been able to get beyond the embryonic stage in the process.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Though the contract would provide essential protections to last through the pandemic, the provisions are only temporary securements as the union looks to \u201cgearing up for a fight next year to win on our remaining outstanding issues,\u201d according to the contract summary. Third-party arbitration in discrimination and harassment proceedings and further compensation guarantees remain among the key bargaining issues for next year.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Davit Antonyan can be reached at <a href=\"mailto:davit.antonyan@thecrimson.com\">davit.antonyan@thecrimson.com</a>.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Callia A.

Isselbacher", "body": "<p><span>As Harvard undergraduates anticipate the format of the fall semester, international students say they will likely have to navigate shifting border restrictions and visa delays.</span></p> <p><span>Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sent a survey to international students Friday to gauge the challenges they expect to face in the fall.</span></p> <p><span>The short survey first asks students to mark both their current place of residence and the country or jurisdiction where they expect to live should they be unable to return to campus.</span></p> <p><span>The survey also asks whether students would wish to return to campus if Harvard continues online learning in the fall but allows a small number of individual students to return. Students could cite personal reasons, such as their living situation making it difficult to study, and academic reasons, such as their research requiring on-campus resources.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, the survey asks if there are factors \u201coutside of Harvard\u2019s control\u201d that students anticipate will prevent them from returning to campus this fall. The options include travel restrictions, visa issues, health issues, and other challenges.</span></p> <p><span>David A. Paffenholz \u201922, an international student from Germany, said he worries that if the United States maintains its ban on travel from nearly all European countries next semester, he would be unable to return to campus in the fall.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere's a lot of students in this situation, a lot of F1 visa holders. I expect the government to hopefully realize that it\u2019s a common problem and allow students to come in,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Germany, if you have a student visa, you are allowed to enter the country right now. Something similar for the U.S. would be nice.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Barbara A. Oedayrajsingh Varma \u201921, a student from the Netherlands, and Justas Jasevicius \u201921, a student from Lithuania, said they have similar concerns about the European travel ban.</span></p> <p><span>Other students face the opposite problem: their home country has restricted travel to and from the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>Noah N. Furlonge-Walker \u201923, who hails from Trinidad and Tobago, said the country\u2019s borders are currently closed to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere are no commercial flights running. So even if I wanted to leave now, I don't think I could,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Furlonge-Walker added he is hopeful flights will start in time for the fall semester, should undergraduates be invited to return to campus.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey've made it very clear that if you would like to leave the country in the next couple of months, they won\u2019t stop you from leaving,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's just people coming in that they have more of a problem with.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Aside from fluctuating border restrictions and flight schedules, international students said they also have to contend with visa issues. Even under normal circumstances, students have to navigate <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/9/25/visa-issues-trump-administration/\">long bureaucratic processes</a> in order to come to Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span>Ran Bi \u201922, who is currently living at home in China, said his F1 student visa will expire if he lives outside the U.S. for more than five months. Though he would technically exceed this 5-month period by the start of the fall semester, he said he feels confident the University will work with the federal government to be flexible about this technicality if undergraduates return to campus.</span></p> <p><span>However, if the fall classes resume online, Bi said international students may be forced to exceed the five-month period out of the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf the classes were to be online the entire year, next year, I think probably us international students would be running into some visa issues,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Fabrizio Serafini \u201923, who currently lives at home in Italy, said it was imperative for international students to be back on campus in the fall, not just logistically but also emotionally.</span></p> <p><span>International students can feel especially \u201clonely\u201d and alienated off-campus, he explained.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you're American, maybe university life is different from your life at home, but it's not that different,\u201d he said. \u201cI live in Italy, where it\u2019s an entirely different universe.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Serafini said that though he believes the University is working hard on behalf of international students, some governmental policies are beyond its reach.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere are certain things such as immigration which are totally out of their control,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Oedayrajsingh Varma, who is co-president of the Woodbridge International Society, said the organization is working on communicating international students\u2019 concerns about the fall term to administrators.</span></p> <p><span>Tuzo Mulunda \u201923, an international student from Kenya, said she hopes Harvard will lobby the State Department to facilitate students\u2019 visa renewals and loosen travel restrictions.</span></p> <p><span>Earlier this month, University President Lawrence S.

But much like in <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/19/Markey-Kennedy-first-debate/\">their first debate</a>, which took place before <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/2/massachusetts-political-campaigns-coronavirus/\">the coronavirus upended traditional campaigning</a>, policy differences were few and far between Monday night.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy made the case that Massachusetts \u201ccan get an awful lot more\u201d out of its representation in the Senate than Markey has delivered, though he declined to take the gloves off fully in the debate, which was hosted at Western Mass News\u2019 studios in Springfield, Mass.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis moment requires stronger presence, better judgement, and clearer vision than Senator Markey has delivered,\u201d Kennedy said.</span></p> <p><span>Markey, who has served in Washington since 1976, pointed to accomplishments on issues such as climate change, Alzheimer\u2019s disease research, and net neutrality. Markey has served in the Senate since 2013.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have led and delivered for the people of Massachusetts since the beginning of my career and throughout this coronavirus pandemic,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>A question from debate moderator Janet Wu put Markey on defense over his commitment to Western Massachusetts residents. Wu, a WCVB-TV political reporter, asked him to explain why \u201cwe don\u2019t see you around Springfield that often.\u201d Markey responded by pointing to a slate of endorsements he picked up from Western Massachusetts officials just prior to the debate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe reason they have endorsed me is that I come to Western Massachusetts,\u201d he said. \u201cI take care of the problems of the people of Massachusetts. I stand up and deliver for them.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy pounced, saying that elected officials in the area told him they had rarely seen Markey in their part of the state. Markey \u2014 who owns a house in Chevy Chase, Md., in addition to his childhood home in Malden, Mass. \u2014 has long been dogged by criticisms that he spends too much of his time inside the Beltway.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t think this state can afford absent leadership in the moment that we are in,\u201d Kennedy said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat is absolutely untrue,\u201d Markey retorted, in the debate\u2019s most heated exchange. \u201cAnd if it was true, then all these mayors would not have endorsed me.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Both candidates expressed solidarity for protestors in Boston and elsewhere following instances of anti-black police brutality that included the killing of George Floyd. Markey lambasted President Donald Trump, who, mere minutes before the debate began, called for increased law enforcement presence across the country and said he may deploy the U.S. military to city streets.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPeople are furious, and they have every right to be,\u201d Kennedy said in his opening remarks. \u201cWe want peace. But there will be no peace without justice. And the fact is that for, far too long, communities of color have been asked to share a burden of structures that they did not write.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Markey said Trump \u201cwants to make America hate again.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s not just our buildings that are on fire, it is the very soul of our country which is on fire right now,\u201d Markey said. \u201cAnd that fire will not go out until we confront the systemic racism that is built into our society.\"</span></p> <p><span>The two candidates differed on their evaluations of how Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker \u201979 has responded to the coronavirus crisis. Asked to give Baker\u2019s response a letter grade, Markey punted, blaming Trump and saying only, \u201cCharlie Baker is working very hard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy was more critical.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAt this point, incomplete. But when it comes to an issue like the Soldiers\u2019 Home, an F,\u201d he said. At the Soldiers\u2019 Home in Holyoke, Mass., at least 76 veterans have died due to COVID-19.</span></p> <p><span>Recent polling suggests the race is tightening after Kennedy initially held a large lead.</span></p> <p><span>Michael Goldman \u2014 a longtime Democratic political consultant \u2014 said the debate didn\u2019t expose any major flaws, but that the candidates \u201cboth appeared to be a little bit rusty\u201d due to their limited experience on the same debate stage. Goldman previously advised Kennedy\u2019s father, former U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-Mass.), and his late great-uncle, longtime U.S. Senator Edward M. \u201cTed\u201d Kennedy \u201954-\u201956 (D-Mass.).</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhile they both have been campaigning, they\u2019ve been campaigning independent of each other,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cI think there was a little bit of rust that could be seen.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy and Markey will square off again Monday in a televised debate hosted by WPRI-TV and Gannett.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Jasper G.

{"title": "Discord in the Big Tent | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For years, the Harvard Republican Club has sought to welcome \u201ceveryone to the right of Marx,\u201d according to former member M. Tyler Jenkins \u201919.</span></p> <p><span>In a sense, the club can\u2019t afford to be too picky. At a university that President Richard M. Nixon once called the \u201cKremlin on the Charles,\u201d politically conservative students have long been a small minority, and their beliefs have ranged widely across the right half of the political spectrum.</span></p> <p><span>But Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has thrown a new wrench into the club\u2019s commitment to \u201cbig-tent\u201d conservatism and has divided college-aged Republicans between those who support the president and those who do not.</span></p> <p><span>In August 2016, the Harvard Republican Club made waves on national media when it <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/5/republican-club-not-support-trump/\">split from its party</a> for the first time in its 128-year history, refusing to support Trump\u2019s bid for president.</span></p> <p><span>In the aftermath of Trump\u2019s election, however, a new faction of conservative undergraduates emerged on campus. These students were dissatisfied with the club\u2019s stated opposition to the Trump administration and attempted to stage a takeover of the club\u2019s leadership.</span></p> <p><span>This year, the Harvard Republicans are gearing up for a critical choice: whether or not to support the president who has won broad support from Republicans nationwide, yet has continued to employ the type of divisive rhetoric that worried club leadership so deeply four years ago.</span></p> <p><span>Few students on Harvard\u2019s campus initially took Trump\u2019s campaign in the 2016 Republican primary very seriously: Students who gathered at debate watch parties were often <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/9/17/trump-republican-debate-watch/\">entertained</a> by Trump\u2019s unapologetic demeanor, but hardly any saw him as a viable candidate, even in conservative circles.</span></p> <p><span>A straw poll conducted at the beginning of the 2016 primaries found that Harvard Republican Club members were almost equally divided between Senator Marco A. Rubio (R-Fla.) and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, with no support at all for Trump. Official club campaign activities focused on those two candidates, and club members took several trips up to New Hampshire to knock doors.</span></p> <p><span>In February 2016, both Aaron I. Henricks \u201916, former club president, and Cameron K. Khansarinia \u201918, a former vice president, <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/1/college-republicans-uneasy-trump/\">said</a> they knew most self-professed conservatives on campus, but did not know of any Harvard students who supported Trump.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think I\u2019ve heard rumors of one existing, maybe in the far reaches of the Quad, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re serious,\u201d Henricks joked at the time.</span></p> <p><span>But as the primaries progressed and Trump\u2019s candidacy became more serious, the club\u2019s leadership became increasingly concerned with his potential nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Many conservatives already felt it was <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/10/1/conservatives-scrutiny-oct-2015/\">difficult enough</a> to speak their views on Harvard\u2019s overwhelmingly liberal campus. But now their party was moving toward nominating a candidate that drew virulent opposition from their classmates.</span></p> <p><span>After Bush and Rubio dropped out of the race, the Harvard Republicans\u2019 campaigning efforts <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/3/24/college-republicans-consider-options/\">slowed</a> to a standstill. The club\u2019s president at the time, Gwen R. Thomas \u201917, said the group would not endorse a Trump nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Later that spring, Thomas decided to take the fall semester off and passed on leadership of the club to Declan P. Garvey \u201917. The club headed into the summer planning to focus its fall activities on down-ballot races.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhile I\u2019m sure some of you, myself included, are not incredibly thrilled with the top of our ticket, there will be plenty of opportunities to get involved in the campaign: helping Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, state-level races here in Massachusetts, and general conservative activism,\u201d Garvey wrote in a club-wide email.</span></p> <p><span>That same summer, however, some club members began to float the idea of putting out a statement more forceful than Thomas\u2019s non-endorsement. A board member sent a message to the board\u2019s group chat proposing the idea of a \u201ccomplete rejection of Trump\u201d written by the executive board.</span></p> <p><span>This statement, the board member argued, could help position the club as the \u201cvanguard\u201d of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement for college Republicans across the country.</span></p> <p><span>Shortly after, Garvey sent club members a poll to gauge whether or not they believed the club should take a stronger stance opposing Trump. After a few days, Garvey shared the results: 80 percent of respondents indicated they were not planning to support Trump in November, while 10 percent would support him and 10 percent remained undecided.</span></p> <p><span>That night, the club put out its official statement, refusing to support the Republican nominee for the first time in its history.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cDonald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic,\u201d the statement read. \u201cHe is looking to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The statement went viral and attracted attention from national news media. Club members went on CNN and MSNBC to explain the decision and field questions from political commentators.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEspecially in the mainstream press, there was an appetite for highlighting conservative voices criticizing the president,\u201d Garvey said in an May 21 interview with The Crimson.</span></p> <p><span>Not everyone approved of the board\u2019s statement. Alex J. Cullen \u201918, a board member who supported Trump, said he wished he had pushed back on the decision.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI wish that I would have been the voice \u2014 even if nobody else was on my side \u2014 to question and to prod and say, \u2018why are we making this decision?\u2019\u201d Cullen said in an interview. \u201cThere was never dialogue about it. It was sort of an understood thing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The club\u2019s statement also placed a heavy strain on its relationship with the Republican National Committee. W. Kent Haeffner \u201918, a board member who co-authored the statement, said that he had been interning at the RNC that summer and got an angry call from Sean M. Spicer, then the RNC\u2019s communications director, after Haeffner appeared on CNN discussing the club\u2019s decision.</span></p> <p><span>Later that year, the RNC barred the Harvard Republicans from using the party\u2019s official elephant logo on club t-shirts due to the club\u2019s \u201cfailure to support the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>An RNC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, Garvey said years later that he never had any regrets about publishing the statement.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt became a lot easier to be a vocal member and a proud member of the club after the disavowal of Trump,\u201d Garvey said. \u201cPeople could make that distinction between being a conservative and being a Trump conservative.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>With the media furor around the club, interest in joining the Harvard Republicans <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/9/14/republican-club-draws-crowd/\">spiked</a> at the beginning of the following school year. Incoming freshmen reached out to the club to get involved before the year even began, and more than 130 people attended the club\u2019s introductory meeting in 2016, compared to about 30 students at a similar meeting the previous year.</span></p> <p><span>While the club\u2019s stance on Trump remained the same, opinions varied as to which presidential candidate the club should throw its support behind instead. Based on the poll Garvey had sent out earlier that summer, almost half of the respondents who disavowed Trump planned to support Libertarian Party nominee Gary E. Johnson, while a quarter planned to back Democratic nominee Hillary R. Clinton.</span></p> <p><span>Other members of the club felt that none of the candidates were good options. A poster advertising the club\u2019s first meeting prominently stated, \u201cCrooked Hillary? Demagogue Donald? How About Neither?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Instead of campaigning for Trump, the club <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/11/7/republicans-canvass-for-ayotte/\">focused its canvassing efforts</a> on then-Senator Kelly A. Ayotte\u2019s (R-N.H.) re-election.</span></p> <p><span>But Trump\u2019s election in November 2016 was a shock to the club\u2019s internal politics. All of a sudden, the club was forced to reckon with its position under the administration of a president it had denounced just months prior.</span></p> <p><span>Trump supporters became more visible following the election, both in the club and on campus at large, according to Jenkins, who was elected to the board as secretary that fall.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere was a Trump contingency on campus, and a lot of people didn\u2019t know that they were Trump supporters,\u201d Jenkins said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThose people really came out of the woodwork,\u201d he added. \u201cThat came out much more when Trump was entering office.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Over the months after Trump\u2019s inauguration, a couple of small but growing factions within the club began to grow displeased with the group\u2019s continued distancing from its own party\u2019s president.</span></p> <p><span>Jacob N. Russell \u201919, a self-described member of one of those factions who said he previously worked on the Trump campaign and transition team, wrote to The Crimson that he thought the club needed to live up to its moniker as an organization for Republicans, not just conservatives.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBy bearing that name we represent the Republican Party on campus,\u201d he wrote in a text message. \u201cIt isn\u2019t good when a club bearing the name of a party doesn\u2019t endorse and publicly criticizes the head of that party.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Tensions came to a head in November 2017, when the Harvard Republican Club held its annual board elections. Believing the club\u2019s leadership needed an overhaul, a new group of disillusioned members organized opposition to the slate of \u201cestablishment\u201d candidates for board positions.</span></p> <p><span>That group was led by Russell and Reed R. McMurchy \u201919, who had previously served as vice president of social events but had since resigned. McMurchy ran for club president, and Russell ran for vice president of campaigns and activism.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe had planned this for a while because we weren\u2019t too happy with the club or its direction,\u201d Russell said of the decision to run.</span></p> <p><span>McMurchy did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</span></p> <p><span>According to the club constitution, members gain voting rights if they pay dues and attend at least two meetings per semester. But the club\u2019s secretary had not kept attendance records to verify who had attended meetings.</span></p> <p><span>The \u201canti-establishment\u201d group was able to capitalize on the oversight by recruiting conservatives who were disillusioned with the club to pay dues and show up to vote on election night, even if some may have not attended the requisite number of meetings. When initial voting concluded, the new group of candidates had won every single board position.</span></p> <p><span>The attendance issue generated controversy, and the group\u2019s election commission \u2014 made up of members of the outgoing board \u2014 called for a new round of elections. Meanwhile, Russell sent an email announcement to the club declaring his slate of candidates the victors and laying out the constitutional backing behind the validity of the election.</span></p> <p><span>The election commission eventually selected a new list of \u201celigible voters\u201d for a second election, using indicators such as the club\u2019s email list and GroupMe to evaluate whether or not voters had plausibly attended meetings.</span></p> <p><span>Those who had won the election the first time around felt like they were being robbed, while members currently on the board believed the anti-establishment had unfairly rigged the election.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn terms of the people I recruited, it was individuals who had conservative dispositions and were fed up with the club itself and definitely would have been more active if the club was under new leadership,\u201d Russell said. \u201cMost of those people weren\u2019t allowed to vote the second time.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>By the second election, McMurchy had dropped out of the running for president, leaving Kiera E. O\u2019Brien \u201920 in an uncontested race. The board that was ultimately elected the second time around comprised a mix of factions \u2014 making for some uncomfortable tension, according to several members.</span></p> <p><span>Some members who were directly involved traded personal insults over the club\u2019s email list, while other club members sent long messages questioning potential constitutional issues with the election commission\u2019s handling of the situation.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe past few years exposed tensions within the party and the club, and these tensions have continued to damage the unity of the club, as demonstrated by the lack of transparency of the electoral process and the insults hurled at members,\u201d one email read.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI too would like my $5 back,\u201d another email read, requesting refunded club dues. \u201cIt has become clear to me that membership in this club is not worth the price of [a] six pack of beer.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Attendance dropped dramatically in the months following the election.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMany of the people who had put energy into going to the meetings, showing up, voting \u2014 people who left that night thinking that they had successfully turned a zombie club into a real club \u2014 had to come back a second time half thinking they wouldn\u2019t be let in the door,\u201d Finn C. Brown \u201919, who served as board treasurer at the time, said.</span></p> <p><span>In the aftermath of the election, O\u2019Brien sent out an announcement calling for club unity, along with a detailed survey to gauge the beliefs of club members.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI thought that was important to be a guiding principle of my leadership,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>A \u201clarge majority\u201d of active club membership filled out the survey, and a majority of respondents still \u201cfelt good\u201d about the Trump non-endorsement decision in 2016, according to O\u2019Brien.</span></p> <p><span>O\u2019Brien said she focused the club\u2019s efforts that year on repairing the relationship with the RNC, promoting transparency, and campaigning for other elections, such as Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker \u201979\u2019s gubernatorial campaign.</span></p> <p><span>When the 2018 club elections rolled around, they proceeded without controversy. Victoria M. Marquez \u201920, who was elected president, ran on a platform of improving the club\u2019s reputation.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019ve been down but we\u2019re not out,\u201d Marquez wrote in her candidate statement. \u201cLackluster member turnout, low campaign participation, and insufficient initiative may have shrunken our ranks to a fraction their former glory, but all is not yet lost.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHere comes the comeback. Let\u2019s get to work,\u201d she added.</span></p> <p><span>Wesley L. Donhauser \u201921, who was elected a vice president of the club, concluded his candidate statement by writing, \u201cLet\u2019s Make HRC Great Again.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In addition to increasing engagement and repairing relationships within the organization, this year\u2019s club leadership must again decide whether or not it will support Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Donhauser, now serving as the club\u2019s president, said the club will not make a decision on its 2020 stance on Trump until they can have an \u201copen mic discussion\u201d within club membership, hopefully <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/5/24/harvard-coronavirus-bacow-fall-planning/\">on campus</a>.</span></p> <p><span>While the final endorsement decision lies with the club\u2019s executive board, Donhauser said he hoped the club\u2019s membership could come to a consensus through \u201copen and honest discussion.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI do think the 2016 decision to not endorse Trump was part of the fact that he had never held political office before,\u201d Donhauser said. \u201cNow, after three or four years of his presidency, we have a lot more meat to go off of.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Donhauser declined to comment further on the club\u2019s stance on Trump for 2020, but said that the club\u2019s decision in 2016 would not \u201cmatter too much\u201d in its decision making process going forward.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think Donald Trump has done some good things for the United States. I think he\u2019s also made some mistakes. All I can say for certain is that we have more to go off of now than in 2016,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Though Donhauser declined to speculate on the upcoming endorsement, board members from years past offered mixed predictions of what this year\u2019s board will decide.</span></p> <p><span>Marquez, the club\u2019s previous president, noted that many new members join the Harvard Republicans each fall, making it difficult to anticipate their political leanings. But Brown, a former treasurer on the board, said he thought the club was more likely to endorse Trump this year.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019d say there\u2019s better odds than not that they do,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Joshua C.

{"title": "The Arrest of a Harvard Professor | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Until the beginning of this year, Chemistry Department Chair Charles M. Lieber \u2014 who had been appointed a University Professor, Harvard\u2019s highest faculty honor, in 2017 \u2014 was primarily known as a celebrated chemist and renowned nanoscientist.</span></p> <p><span>Since late January, however, he has been thrust into a larger spotlight, awaiting trial after being federally charged with providing fraudulent statements to U.S. government officials in relation to undisclosed work with the Chinese government.</span></p> <p><span>On January 28, Lieber was arrested on one count of lying to the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health about his involvement with the Wuhan University of Technology and the Thousand Talents Plan, a research recruitment program funded by the Chinese government.</span></p> <p><span>In a press release, the U.S. Department of Justice described the TTP as a Chinese initiative that aims to \u201clure Chinese overseas talent and foreign experts to bring their knowledge and experience to China and reward individuals for stealing proprietary information.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Charging documents accused Lieber of signing a five-year contract with WUT as a \u201cstrategic scientist\u201d in November 2011 and a three-year contract with the TTP in June 2012. His responsibilities included publishing papers and organizing conferences in the name of WUT, accepting several WUT students as visiting scholars, and organizing a Harvard-WUT joint research laboratory in Wuhan. Lieber was offered up to $50,000 per month contingent on his work time in China, living expenses of around $158,000 over three years, and approximately $1.74 million in research funds for the joint laboratory.</span></p> <p><span>The affidavit described Lieber\u2019s primary charges as his false claim to the Department of Defense that he had never been recruited by the TTP, and a fraudulent interview with Harvard authorities, which led the University to misinform the NIH that Lieber had not been associated with WUT since 2012 and was never a member of the TTP.</span></p> <p><span>U.S. Attorney Andrew E. Lelling said in an interview with Science magazine that his primary concern with Lieber\u2019s case was the large payments involved in the contracts.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was the amount of money involved that drew our attention,\u201d Lelling said. \u201cThat is a corrupting level of money.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Marc L. Mukasey, Lieber\u2019s trial counsel, refuted any claims of dishonesty against Lieber in an emailed statement to The Crimson.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere is nothing corrupt about Charlie Lieber,\u201d he wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Lieber was released after accepting a <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/1/31/lieber-million-bail/\">$1 million bail</a> agreement and surrendering his and his wife\u2019s U.S. passports. Harvard <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/1/29/lieber-federal-charges/\">placed him on paid administrative leave</a>, and he has since been <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/6/new-chem-chairs-post-lieber/\">replaced</a> as Chemistry department chair by interim co-chairs Theodore A. Betley and Daniel Kahne.</span></p> <p><span>Lieber\u2019s reputation has since become closely linked to his interactions with China, at times even leading to <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/15/harvard-coronavirus-lieber-conspiracy-theories/\">false conspiracy theories</a> online suggesting that Lieber created and sold the novel coronavirus.</span></p> <p><span>Mukasey wrote that such claims are baseless and \u201cbrainless.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cTheories linking him to the coronavirus are 1,000% false,\u201d Mukasey wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s the brainless musing of morons on social media.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Lieber, meanwhile, has maintained his innocence as he awaits trial. Mukasey wrote that he plans to prove Lieber is the victim in this case and not the perpetrator.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cProfessor Lieber has dedicated his life to science and to his students. Not money, not fame, just his science and his students,\u201d Mukasey wrote. \u201cBut he\u2019s also a fighter \u2014 he always has been \u2014 so we\u2019re not taking this lying down. We\u2019re fighting back.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAnd when justice is done, Charlie\u2019s good name will be restored and the scientific community again will be able to benefit from his intellect and passion,\u201d he added.</span></p> <p><span>At the heart of Lieber\u2019s case is his involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan \u2014 and his subsequent failure to disclose TTP funding to Harvard and U.S. government officials.</span></p> <p><span>Founded in 2008, the TTP offers funding to attract skilled academics and researchers to Chinese institutions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Thousand Talent Program that was mentioned as part of the case at Harvard has been quite fabulous and popular,\u201d said Maria Repnikova, the director of the Center for Global Information Studies at Georgia State University. \u201cThey are attracting these individuals with resources and creating an environment for them that might not be feasible to create in some of the Western universities.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In the charging documents against Lieber, FBI agent Robert Plumb described the TTP as a program that \u201cincentivizes\u201d U.S. researchers to transmit knowledge gained in the U.S. to China.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Chinese Talent programs have rewarded individuals for stealing proprietary information and violating export controls,\u201d Plumb wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Several academics said such academic recruitment is typical within the field of higher education.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard is home to many of the leading scholars in the world,\u201d said Michael A. Szonyi, the director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard. \u201cAnd so if you were trying to build a world-class department or world-class laboratory, it only makes sense that you would try to recruit the skills and talents of people from Harvard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>China studies professor William C. Kirby, who also chairs the Harvard China Fund, said attracting distinguished talent is a fundamental characteristic of higher education institutions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cRecruitment and retention is what universities do. You do not want a faculty that nobody else wants. Otherwise you\u2019ve got the wrong faculty,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cSo if somebody is not trying to steal your faculty, you have the wrong faculty.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Ross McKinney Jr., the Chief Scientific Officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges, wrote that Chinese-based faculty recruitment works similarly to U.S.-based faculty recruitment.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cChina is trying to acquire talent, which is no different than Harvard trying to recruit from Yale,\u201d McKinney wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s not my impression their search is limited to U.S. universities. They\u2019re happy to recruit talent from wherever good science is happening.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The U.S. government, however, has accused the TTP of stealing proprietary information and knowledge from U.S. institutions. In July 2019, the U.S. Department of Energy barred all researchers from participating in the TTP. Subsequently, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security declared the program a threat to American interests.</span></p> <p><span>Some familiar with the TTP were reluctant to label its practices as academic espionage.</span></p> <p><span>Tim Byrnes, a physics professor at New York University Shanghai and a member of the TTP, said the program\u2019s system of offering increased funding to top researchers is not dissimilar from other international grant programs.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis type of system where adding top-ups and adding extra amounts of money, I would say, is not unheard of,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a completely China-only type of phenomenon.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Szonyi, however, noted that disclosure is essential to academic collaboration. Typically, university personnel must report all funding sources for academic ventures outside of their home university; Harvard, for instance, requires faculty to disclose outside funding to the Office of the Vice Provost for Research.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that it\u2019s not right to call [the TTP] espionage. That is simply Chinese universities trying to engage with the leading scholars in the world,\u201d Szonyi said. \u201cTo the extent that I\u2019ve worried that that is a gray area, there are actually people at Harvard whose full time job is to receive and evaluate my disclosures.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Kirby added that there is no coercive element to participation in the TTP.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFirst of all, the last that I understood, there actually is freedom of movement in this country and people are free to choose where they would work,\u201d he said. \u201cSo no one is being kidnapped, no one is being stolen. It\u2019s the job of universities to find talent and then to try to bring the best of it to their own university.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In light of international criticism of the TTP, the Chinese government stopped promoting the program in national media in September 2018.</span></p> <p><span>Byrnes said Lieber\u2019s nondisclosure of his interactions with the TTP may have been due to the increasing stigma against the program.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn the case of Professor Lieber, probably what happened is that he received this thing before it had this kind of negative spin on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt became inconvenient at some point to have this connection, so he tried to cover it up so that he wouldn\u2019t be penalized for other opportunities, like within the U.S., for example. And then that obviously backfired terribly for him.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Byrnes added that he believes academia and international conflicts should become more separated in the future, so that researchers can focus on intellectual pursuits instead of politics.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cResearchers are not interested in politics or this kind of power struggle between countries \u2013 researchers just really want to do top level research and that\u2019s true in the U.S. and China,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it is a difficult time because, as I said, China\u2019s just really emerged and how to deal with this is kind of a concern of many countries.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Lieber\u2019s arrest marks merely the latest incident in <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/23/harvard-china-scrutiny/\">the long and complicated history of Harvard\u2019s role in U.S.-China relations</a>. Formal relationships between Harvard and China have existed since 1879, when the University hired its first Chinese language instructor.</span></p> <p><span>Szonyi said the U.S.-China academic relationship has been characterized by two key aspects: deeper academic collaboration in the last few decades and an overall deterioration in the two countries\u2019 relations in the last couple of years.</span></p> <p><span>According to the Harvard International Office, Chinese nationals represented 22 percent of the international student population at Harvard in the 2019-2020 academic year. Nationwide, Chinese nationals comprise a third of the international student population, with over 360,000 students enrolled in U.S. universities.</span></p> <p><span>Claude Barfield, a former consultant to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, said uneasy relationships with China reflect a larger trend beyond the politics of a given presidential administration.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe U.S. and China were moving toward some type of contentious relationship, even before the Trump presidency,\u201d Barfield said. \u201cThe Chinese had refused to change their market protectionism, huge subsidies given to the companies. They were causing problems all over the South China Sea, threatening the U.S. alliance.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Others pointed to additional factors that have soured the U.S.-China relationship.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou also have an American administration that appears to have the need for an adversary, even if some of them are our allies, in order to bolster itself domestically,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the Trump administration, but there\u2019s a greater consensus in the political establishment \u2014 a fear of where China may be going.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere are also increasing concerns about sharing data, as well as collaborating in the area of science and technology, which relates to the case of the arrest at Harvard,\u201d Repnikova added.</span></p> <p><span>Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs said in an April interview that China\u2019s growing economy and technological advancements may have also contributed to U.S. efforts to \u201coutcompete\u201d China.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy personal view is if you look at the geostrategic balance, this country sees China as challenging its world supremacy, and China is investing more in science and technology than the U.S. is by some normalization metric,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Due to these concerns, the U.S. federal government has increasingly cracked down on cases deemed as \u201cacademic espionage.\u201d The FBI has examined more than 1,000 cases of Chinese theft of U.S. technology, many of which have been connected with research on university campuses.</span></p> <p><span>In a March seminar on academic security, FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said the threat of Chinese academic espionage is one of the nation\u2019s largest security challenges.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn my 25 years with the FBI, we have faced a lot of challenging threats,\u201d he said. \u201cOne that stands out right now as the greatest long-term threat to our nation\u2019s information and ideas and to our economic vitality and leadership is the threat from the Chinese government.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Lieber\u2019s arrest was just one of many the FBI made in the first half of 2020. On the day of his arraignment, the FBI also announced investigations into <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/1/2/zheng-hms-research-smuggling/\">two other cases</a> in the Boston area.</span></p> <p><span>Barfield characterized Lieber\u2019s arrest as propagated by the larger context of FBI investigations into U.S.-China relations.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think Lieber just got caught in the larger decision that the United States would try to reduce universities\u2019 Chinese relationship here in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worry was that \u2014 and is that \u2014 you\u2019ve got Chinese researchers who are not really independent.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Szonyi cautioned that current allegations of widespread academic espionage may be overstated.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI am absolutely confident that the vast majority of collaborations are academic in nature and should not be characterized as espionage, but rather as knowledge sharing and actually doing what it is that academics do,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>However, Szonyi said there are many gray areas that could constitute espionage. The predominant belief is that scholars should benefit financially when a technology or idea they developed has \u201cpractical business implications.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s relatively straightforward if the idea or the application or the technology is monetized in the United States, but what if it\u2019s monetized in China?\u201d Szonyi said. \u201cFrom that scholar\u2019s perspective, what the scholar is doing is exactly the same.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Since Lieber\u2019s arrest, several Harvard administrators have said they support the University\u2019s policies for funding and research disclosure, despite the procedures\u2019 limitations.</span></p> <p><span>Stubbs said in April that the charges against Lieber did not trigger any changes in the current internal review processes. Harvard <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/11/6/nih-research-faculty-meeting/\">announced</a> two new research oversight committees last November: one to review sensitive research projects and the other to examine whether Faculty of Arts and Sciences policies comply with federal funding agency guidelines.</span></p> <p><span>University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in a March interview with The Crimson that Harvard is <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/3/bacow-lieber-funding-policies/\">unable to</a> investigate faculty members\u2019 \u201coutside engagements\u201d and instead relies on their \u201chonesty and good faith\u201d to follow appropriate University procedures.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think one of the things that we\u2019re struggling with is instances of non-disclosure and how do we take steps to try to identify those instances, given that we\u2019re not a law enforcement agency and we\u2019re not an intelligence agency,\u201d Stubbs said. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to step up and play our role in this evolving landscape of vigilance.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Lynn Pasquerella \u2014 the president of the Association of American Colleges and Universities, which represents nearly 1,400 U.S. institutions of higher education \u2014 said any oversight must take into account systemic issues of race.</span></p> <p><span>In August 2019, the AAC&amp;U signed onto a statement urging the federal government to protect the due process and privacy of Chinese students in the face of increased efforts to combat academic espionage.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase in anti-Asian hate crimes and bias incidents, and so this provides a backdrop for looking at policies \u2014 that even if they are not intended to target or discriminate against individuals from China \u2014 have that impact as a fact,\u201d Pasquerella said.</span></p> <p><span>The impact of increased scrutiny into Chinese ties could serve as a deterrent for academic exchange, according to Repnikova.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAt the very least, this creates a lot of anxiety amongst individuals from China \u2014 scholars or scientists who are working at American universities \u2014 about the extent of the stability of their position, but also the extent of their freedom,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>Kirby said international collaboration is crucial to advancing the \u201cnext generations of research.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf there are artificial limits on the kind of individuals who can come here, this sets us back, particularly in science and technology. How that is to American advantage is, for me, impossible to imagine,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard administrators have also emphasized the importance of ongoing collaborations with Chinese and other foreign universities.</span></p> <p><span>Bacow said in March that working with other institutions is crucial to fulfilling Harvard\u2019s goals.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s important that we engage with faculty and scholars in different parts of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is, in fact, how we succeed in addressing some of the greatest challenges that we confront.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Stubbs said in February that \u201cunwritten norms and expectations of conduct\u201d are significant factors in ensuring prosperous relationships between Harvard and other universities.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019re wrestling to come to an understanding of how to strike a balance between supporting free and open research in scholarship with some underlying expectation of good conduct in the face of some instances that seem to not conform to those expectations,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Pasquerella echoed Stubbs\u2019 sentiments, noting that collaboration between people of diverse backgrounds is crucial to addressing global challenges.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI always come back to the need for global collaboration and addressing the problems for the future, as opposed to nationalistic tendencies that are focused on protecting America-first ideologies,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Ethan Lee can be reached at ethan.lee@thecrimson.com.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff Writer Andy Z.

{"title": "Who Does Harvard\u2019s Endowment Serve? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>At the close of Fiscal Year 2019, Harvard\u2019s endowment was valued at $40.9 billion, the largest sum in its history. Though administrators <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/9/27/harvard-endowment-returns-2019/\">fretted about low returns</a> compared to other Ivy League schools and the <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/4/CFO-recession-planning/\">prospect of a future recession</a>, they basked in their record-setting financial achievement.</span></p> <p><span>Then came the coronavirus pandemic.</span></p> <p><span>Facing a teetering global economy and the threat of a lethal virus, Harvard has <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/14/harvard-coronavirus-hiring-salary-freeze/\">invoked austerity measures</a> including salary and hiring freezes and the possibility of furloughs and layoffs, leaving some workers with an uncertain future.</span></p> <p><span>To address these labor concerns, Harvard College Students for Bernie <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/21/students-launch-campaign-for-workers/\">launched its #40BillionForWhat</a> effort.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cForty billion for what, Harvard?\u201d the campaign statement reads. \u201cWhat is the point of our University\u2019s hoarded wealth, if not to ensure the well-being and safety of its community during a time of fear, uncertainty, and instability?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The campaign echoed calls before the pandemic from activists who urged the University to use its endowment to advance social good.</span></p> <p><span>Oya Gursoy \u201921\u2014 a member of Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine, one of a number of campus divestment movements \u2014 said that the pandemic has made the \u201cfacade\u201d of the endowment visible.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you can't use the endowment during a pandemic, then when can we, in fact, use it? Then what is the endowment for?\u201d Gursoy asked. \u201cIf it's not going to be used during a pandemic to support faculty and students and workers, then when is it going to be used?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The University has said the value of the endowment has likely declined due to the impact of the pandemic on the global markets. Administrators also contend that much of the endowment is made up of restricted assets \u2014 which cannot be used for purposes other than those stipulated with the donation \u2014 and that the endowment must be preserved for posterity.</span></p> <p><span>So far, Gursoy and other activists have remained unsatisfied with this response.</span></p> <p><span>At the heart of the debate are contrasting perspectives on what the endowment truly is, and who it exists to serve. How the endowment is utilized will play a critical role in shaping the University\u2019s response to the pandemic, and the implications of that decision will influence how affiliates perceive the endowment in the future.</span></p> <p><span>The endowment dates back to 1638, starting with John Harvard\u2019s gift of 400 books and half his estate that made him the University\u2019s namesake, according to University President Lawrence S. Bacow.</span></p> <p><span>Other accounts trace it back to 1649, when four alumni donated a parcel of real estate \u2014 \u201ca once upon a time cowyard\u201d \u2014 to the College. Today, Widener Library occupies that land. In 1669, a number of lumber merchants pledged to donate 60 pounds to Harvard for each of the next seven years, a commitment they sometimes fulfilled with lumber products.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis development has been assembled really over hundreds of years, literally hundreds,\u201d Bacow said. \u201cHaving been assembled over centuries, we can't just spend it all at once.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Today, the endowment retains real estate and natural resources as asset classes, but few other relics of the time period exist in the University\u2019s financial strategy. And though funds may have been accumulating for centuries, rapid growth is a much more recent development.</span></p> <p><span>From the 1640s to the mid-20th century, the endowment was managed conservatively and made up of fixed-income investments. When Harvard Management Company was founded in 1974, it was valued at $1.1 billion.</span></p> <p><span>In a video to mark the 40th anniversary of HMC in 2014, Walter M. Cabot \u201955 \u2014 its first CEO \u2014 explained the rationale behind the move to internal management.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Corporation, with the endowment up close to $1 billion, wanted more internal control,\u201d Cabot said. \u201cThey wanted more to be a part of the governance of the portfolio.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Former University President Derek C. Bok said the shift was the brainchild of George F. Bennett \u201933, a former Treasurer of the University.</span></p> <p><span>Bennett formerly served as the president of State Street Bank, which managed the endowment before the founding of HMC. Upon his retirement, Bennett proposed that the University found an outside company to manage the endowment, as the crucial endeavor of managing Harvard\u2019s funds had become \u201ctoo big a job.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Along with the change in management came changes to the endowment\u2019s contents.</span></p> <p><span>Before the founding of HMC, the endowment funds were split between bonds, cash, and shares of major companies with reliable returns, known as \u201cblue chip common stocks.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Under Cabot, HMC broadened its focus. Its managers shifted assets from a domestic portfolio to a global portfolio, transitioned from public securities to private securities, and established a trade desk to invest in bonds.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe key to investing is a long term vision, and as long as we could recruit good people and the returns were satisfactory, in the long run, it was both good for the University and cheaper, because we could run the money at a lot cheaper rate than what pension funds charged,\u201d Cabot said.</span></p> <p><span>Under HMC, the value of the endowment at first grew slowly. In 1984, a decade after its founding, it had doubled, to $2.5 billion. By 1994, it doubled again, to $6 billion. And by 2004, it almost quadrupled, to $22.6 billion.</span></p> <p><span>Though its growth was at times inconsistent, the endowment had ballooned to $36.9 billion in 2008. Then the Great Recession hit, slashing its value by a third. It didn\u2019t recover until 2015, and it didn\u2019t stick \u2014 in 2016, its value dropped back below its 2008 value.</span></p> <p><span>Since then, 2017, 2018, and 2019 saw consistent low levels of growth, and the endowment stood at $40.9 billion in June 2019.</span></p> <p><span>The coronavirus pandemic has almost certainly ended that trend. In April, Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister told The Crimson the endowment had likely declined \u201csubstantially\u201d and cited an estimate that put the value in the \u201cmid-30 billion range.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As a looming economic downturn became more and more evident, the University has hesitated to depend on endowment funds. Instead, in April, top administrators <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/14/harvard-coronavirus-hiring-salary-freeze/\">announced</a> a salary and hiring freeze, the cancellation or deferral of all discretionary spending, and cuts to their own salaries.</span></p> <p><span>To administrators, the endowment is not intended to cover all unexpected expenses, no matter the circumstance. When constructing its annual budget, Harvard often plans to cover roughly a third of its expenses with a five percent endowment payout, leaving the majority of the endowment to generate returns for posterity.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe have a legal and moral responsibility to maintain the purchasing power of that endowment, so that it sustains future generations,\u201d Bacow said. \u201cThere's issues of intergenerational equity that need to be considered.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bacow and Hollister both cited the fact that Harvard has experienced financial hardship in the past \u2014 like the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1918, the Great Depression, and World War II, as well as several other recessions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPrior generations have had to make hard choices to scale their expenditures in proportion to their revenues, and by making those hard choices they have passed onto future generations the resources which allow them to be supported by the endowment,\u201d Bacow said. \u201cIt's our responsibility also to make hard choices. We can't just say that we are exempt from having to do this.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In her 2008 Commencement Address, former University President Drew G. Faust acknowledged the endowment\u2019s longevity.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOur endowment represents an accountability that generation after generation of Harvard graduates have voluntarily assumed, acknowledging the value of their own past education and investing in the future of learning,\u201d she said at the time.</span></p> <p><span>Administrators also point to legal restrictions on the endowment \u2014 which is made up of over 13,000 individual funds \u2014 that prevent administrators from distributing money at will.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe vast majority of the endowment is highly restricted, and we cannot redirect funds that are restricted for one purpose to be used for another,\u201d Bacow said. \u201cLegally, we cannot do that. So, our ability to dip into the endowment is limited.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In a 2016 letter to Congress, Faust explained that just 16 percent of the funds are considered \u201cunrestricted,\u201d though that figure includes funds dedicated to a specific school. Around 80 percent of endowment funds today are dedicated to individual schools.</span></p> <p><span>Bok noted that many of Harvard\u2019s top donors give to a particular cause or initiative that they want the University to pursue. Common restrictions are funds dedicated to professorships and faculty salaries, financial aid, research, specific initiatives, and support for libraries and museums.</span></p> <p><span>Sandy Baum, a senior fellow for the Center on Education Data and Policy at the Urban Institute, said the coronavirus pandemic challenges the assumption that the endowment should not be overspent in the present day.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you spend too much of it now, then you won't be able to provide in the future the same quality of education for generations of students to come,\u201d Baum said. \u201cOn the other hand, if right now we're in a crisis, and you're not able to provide opportunities to students today like the ones that you want to be able to provide in the future when we're not in a crisis, then you need to think about spending a little bit more today.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bacow conceded that within the limited flexibility that they have, administrators will use the endowment \u201cmore heavily\u201d than they might have if the coronavirus pandemic had not occurred.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe will use the endowment more heavily than we have in the past precisely because of the circumstances that we find ourselves,\u201d Bacow said.</span></p> <p><span>The University\u2019s response has left few student activists satisfied.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey're sort of like, 'Can't we just save the world? We have all this money, let's save the world,\u2019\u201d Baum said.</span></p> <p><span>Baum noted that even given its limitations, the University has access to an undeniably large sum of money. Compared to its peers in higher education, Harvard boasts the largest total endowment in the world.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey don't have $40 billion that they could use,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they do have more resources than certainly most businesses that are trying to figure out how to survive now.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Thomas D. Parker \u201964, a senior fellow at the Institute for Higher Education Policy, said the school still lacks enough money to avoid all consequences of the pandemic.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think Harvard can use some of its wealth to try to mitigate the effects of the current crisis,\u201d Parker said. \u201cBut it's clear that there's simply not enough money there just to continue business as usual. The arithmetic doesn't work out.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Another key factor to contextualize the endowment\u2019s value is the annual operating expenses of the University in a normal year. Parker said the endowment would typically constitute \u201cabout seven or eight years\u201d of operating expenses, which totalled $5.2 billion in FY19.</span></p> <p><span>But these are not normal times, and the pandemic has led to unexpected expenses and cuts.</span></p> <p><span>Labor activists in Harvard College Students for Bernie and other groups have sought to ensure that the brunt of the financial downturn does not fall on Harvard\u2019s workers. They have called on Harvard to use the endowment to provide their employees with pay while they are unable to work, contract extensions for those who need them, and sufficient paid sick leave.</span></p> <p><span>Ruy Martinez \u201922, a member of Harvard for Bernie, said workers\u2019 compensation should be prioritized equally to the needs of faculty and students.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey are as vital to the Harvard community as professors and students,\u201d Martinez wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Even before the coronavirus pandemic, Harvard\u2019s Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers frequently invoked the endowment in their calls for fair pay. During their month-long strike in December 2019, union demonstrators often chanted, \u201cHarvard, pay your worker scholars! You have 40 billion dollars!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Olivia Crough, a graduate student and union member, wrote that their demands were not aimed at \u201cliquidating the principal of the endowment.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe are asking for endowment growth to be slowed to match inflation and for a higher percentage of returns to be allocated toward fairly compensating the work of graduate students and adjunct faculty,\u201d Crough wrote. \u201cThis would not only maintain but advance the endowment\u2019s core mission.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Crough wrote that she has not been convinced by administrators\u2019 explanation that the endowment must grow for the future.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe administration leans on platitudes like \u2018intergenerational equity\u2019 to justify the cuts it chooses to make,\u201d she wrote.</span></p> <p><span>While a number of students and faculty activists urged Harvard to aid its workers by engaging its endowment, some conservative politicians demanded Harvard not receive federal aid because of its wealth.</span></p> <p><span>The federal government <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/15/harvard-coronavirus-cares-act/\">allocated $8.6 million</a> to the University under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which included a Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund.</span></p> <p><span>The allocation <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/21/harvard-stimulus-funds-financial-aid/\">triggered uproar</a> from Republican politicians, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and President Donald J. Trump. Almost all of them cited the size of the endowment as a reason Harvard should not receive federal funds.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWell, look, I don\u2019t like when Harvard that has, I think, a $40 billion dollar endowment, or some incredible amount of money, that Harvard gets this money?,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/22/trump-harvard-return-cares-money/\">said at a press conference</a>. \u201cHarvard should pay this money back. I want Harvard to pay that money back.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In reality, Harvard had not yet applied for or received the funds which it was allocated. Though at first a spokesperson for Harvard said the University would <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/21/harvard-stimulus-funds-financial-aid/\">dedicate 100 percent</a> of the funds to student aid, they later announced that they <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/23/harvard-coronavirus-not-accepting-cares-act/\">would not take</a> the funds at all \u2014 a move that Trump lauded.</span></p> <p><span>Bacow attributed the decision not to take the funds to \u201cunattractive\u201d restrictions placed on them.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe were not allowed to use the money to support our international students, and we are not allowed to use the money to support our undocumented students,\u201d Bacow said. \u201cWe thought that, among other things, that if we took the money, we would have to dip into other resources to treat our international students, and undocumented students on an equal basis to all others who would be eligible to receive those funds.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Baum attributed the controversy over the CARES Act funds to conservative animosity towards colleges and universities.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Republicans in particular feel like these are liberal bastions of indoctrination,\u201d Baum said. \u201cThey actually are looking for any opportunity they can get to sort of stick it at these places.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This was not the first time Republicans targeted higher education endowments. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 levies a 1.4 percent excise tax on the endowments of private colleges and universities with at least 500 students and endowment assets that total over $500,000 per student. The tax was <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/11/14/bacow-endowment-tax/\">estimated</a> to cost Harvard $40 to $50 million.</span></p> <p><span>At the time of its passage, the Cato Institute\u2019s Neal McCluskey wrote that the tax was \u201clittle more than a politicized \u2018Take That, Harvard!\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Former University President Lawrence H. Summers said he sees the endowment tax as a politically-motivated \u201cact of revenge.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\"I both think it was motivated in a fake way, and I think it doesn't correspond to any principled kind of tax policy,\u201d Summers said.</span></p> <p><span>Mae C. Quinn, a professor at the University of Florida, said labelling the endowment tax and the controversy over the CARES Act funds as part of the conservative political agenda is a scapegoat for universities like Harvard to avoid engaging with genuine concern about their level of wealth.</span></p> <p><span>The idea of an endowment tax had liberals supporters, too, like former Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial candidate <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/9/20/jay-gonzalez-tax/\">Jay Gonzalez</a>, who wanted Harvard to pay $500 million in taxes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFolks are concerned about universities being able to stockpile this money, and not utilizing it in ways that could advance the public good,\u201d Quinn said.</span></p> <p><span>Joshua Humphreys, a senior fellow at the Croatan Institute and former Harvard lecturer, wrote that large endowments are a symptom of an \u201cacademic arms race.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\"It [is] not clear why an institution of higher learning continues to strive to increase the size of the endowment, rather than to use it in different ways to maintain stability of mission and to reinvest in the university,\u201d he wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard administrators maintain that a growing endowment is vital to its mission.</span></p> <p><span>In her letter to Congress in 2016, Faust explained that tuition and grants do not cover the full cost of education and research, respectively.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIncreasingly, endowments play a significant role in bridging these gaps and making it possible for Harvard to pursue its mission,\u201d she wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Without an endowment, Harvard would likely experience greater year-to-year financial instability and have less autonomy, since it would be more beholden to donors, Parker said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn terms of private universities, it's pretty difficult to think of being truly great without having a substantial amount of money in the bank,\u201d Parker said.</span></p> <p><span>Jay Mathews \u201967 \u2014 an education columnist for the Washington Post and a former editor of The Crimson \u2014 wrote that he does not think that endowment size correlates to a university\u2019s greatness.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don't think it says anything important about the quality of the school,\u201d Mathews wrote in an email. Still, he conceded there are benefits to the school\u2019s endowment, which has grown from less than $1 billion in his time at Harvard to $40 billion today.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think it gives the school great room to be creative and innovative, and in some ways it has done that,\u201d Mathews wrote. \u201cIt supports some important research.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mathews noted that as the size of the endowment grew, so too did its prominence in campus conversation.</span></p> <p><span>Today, it\u2019s a frequent topic of debate. There are at least four divestment groups on campus: Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, Harvard Puerto Rican Debt Divestment Campaign, and Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine. All four recently formed the Endowment Justice Coalition, with the sole focus of pushing \u201cfor a new vision of Harvard\u2019s obligations as a moral actor.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Gursoy said that because it is an educational institution, Harvard should focus on social good, \u201crather than adding more zeros to the endowment.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bacow has previously said that the endowment should not be used \u201cas an instrument of social policy.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think there are far more effective ways for us to influence social policy, public policy, as well, through our research, our scholarship, through our actions and through our teaching,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/12/14/bacow-new-rationale-divestment/\">said</a> in 2018.</span></p> <p><span>Likewise, Parker said he believes that if the University wants to continue to grow, \u201cin terms of its ability to address important issues of the day,\u201d it will need its endowment funds.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThose issues are not going to diminish over time, and there's no reason you should think that you would need less money to address those issues over time, and not more,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that across the ideological spectrum there's a tendency to to overestimate the way in which the endowment can be a kind of all purpose rescue fund. It really can't,\u201d Parker added. \u201cPeople misunderstand \u2014 both on the left and right \u2014 the availability and the extent that the endowment can be a kind of deus ex machina, which comes in at the end of the day and saves everybody.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As the pandemic alters almost every aspect of life on campus, the calls for Harvard to reconsider its traditional approach to the endowment have grown louder: if not now, when? How the University chooses to answer this question in the midst of a crisis remains to be seen, and might set a precedent for decades to come.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Ellen M.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In 2012, Moderna Therapeutics, a new Cambridge-based biotech firm was at a fork in the road. Its new messenger RNA technology seemed endowed with limitless possibility. The question was what to do with it.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey have to be inside the cells to do anything. But then, they could do anything. The sky\u2019s the limit when it comes to RNA,\u201d explains Timothy A. Springer, a professor at Harvard Medical School and founding investor in Moderna.</span></p> <p><span>Moderna hired McKinsey and Company to answer these questions. Springer recalls what the company asked of the consultants: \u201cJust look at the entire universe of the kinds of drugs we could develop. What makes the most sense for us?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Today, Moderna has found their project: the search for a COVID-19 vaccine.</span></p> <p><span>Vaccines, however, have not always been the focus of Moderna\u2019s efforts. The company\u2019s messenger RNA technology was always uniquely suited for vaccines, but the McKinsey team had other ideas. \u201cThey suggested that rare diseases would be the most valuable area to go into,\u201d Springer says. \u201cTo be honest, they valued vaccines as rather low, because normally vaccines are pretty much commodity items, so companies don\u2019t make that much money on vaccines.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And yet, in April, Moderna shares skyrocketed when the company became one of the first in the U.S. to begin human trials for a COVID-19 vaccine. The company had just received up to $483 million from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to fund the vaccine\u2019s development.</span></p> <p><span>Springer made headlines. His shares had made him a billionaire.</span></p> <p><span>But this windfall may have surprised a younger version of himself. Springer, a mustachioed man in his early 70s, explains that his college years were characterized by an ambivalence toward making money.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI grew up in the \u201960s. I was an undergraduate at Berkeley, and the spirit of the times were just very different then,\u201d Springer muses. \u201cThat\u2019s why\u2026 I didn\u2019t really think much about making money at all.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He assumed, in fact, that \u201cchoosing to become an academic would subject me to being impecunious.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>This ambivalence toward money shaped his early career: Springer recalls that he had a \u201cpretty cavalier attitude\u201d about patenting discoveries. \u201cI made some very important discoveries and did not patent them,\u201d Springer says with a slightly rueful chuckle.</span></p> <p><span>But Springer\u2019s career since the late 1990s has included remarkable success not only in the world of scientific research, but also in the world of business. Springer has started six companies \u2014 three as a founder, three as an investor \u2014 and all of them, he tells me, have been financially successful.</span></p> <p><span>During our interview, Springer sits in his home office, an array of his photographs, awards, and certificates lining the wall behind him. The gold coin of the prestigious Crafoord Prize, which is awarded annually to individuals who lead scientific research, glints at eye level.</span></p> <p><span>Springer attributes this success to his investing strategy: \u201cMy return is 58 percent per year, which is stunning. The V.Cs. that I talk to are flabbergasted that I\u2019m so successful. But the reason is that I\u2019m rigorous.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have deep insight not only into my own research, but if it\u2019s an area of biology I understand, I can evaluate it. Which is why I only invest in biotech \u2014 I didn\u2019t try to do the same thing in software, for example. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s good software or not,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Despite his financial success, Springer says his scientific research has always come first. \u201cThere are many people in academia, who just want to start a company... To me that\u2019s secondary. I really want to do good science. Sometimes, I see there\u2019s an incredible opportunity in the science I happen to be doing, and that\u2019s when I found a company.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>It is often difficult, Springer says, to bring the fruits of his research to the public without business. There simply isn\u2019t enough money within the university to fund the clinical trials necessary for the development of a drug.</span></p> <p><span>Springer recalls, for example, research he performed in the late 1990s, which gained insight into \u201chow white blood cells got out of the bloodstream.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Springer recalls his thought process: \u201cThis has huge potential to cure disease and make people better. There are so many different molecules to cover, so many different aspects to this, I couldn\u2019t possibly do it in my lab. You know, even if I got ten grants, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it efficiently \u2014 the best way to tackle this was to start a company.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>LeukoSite, the company born out of his discovery, was a success. It was as though the world lay at his feet. \u201cI could have just retired\u2026 you know, sailed around the world.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He had to think, carefully, about what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. Eventually, he decided the open seas could wait. He concluded: \u201cI just like being a scientist.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>At that time, Springer dismissed the idea of pursuing other start-up ventures. Then, in 2008, something came along that drew him from his \u201centrepreneurial retirement\u201d: A friend of Springer\u2019s, a professor at Harvard Medical School, had been trying to create a company focused on modified RNA.</span></p> <p><span>At the time, not many people had heard the name, Moderna.</span></p> <p><span>From the beginning Springer understood that the messenger RNA research around which Moderna was formed had incredible potential for vaccines.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cVaccines are really the sweet spot of RNA technology,\u201d he explains.</span></p> <p><span>Springer had his \u201cdrug-developing juices flowing again.\u201d He provided one third of Moderna\u2019s founding capital.</span></p> <p><span>To some extent, Springer\u2019s involvement in Moderna reflects a broader relationship between academic research and the world of science-turned-business. In the end, companies get their hands on scientific breakthroughs innovated in universities after the fact. He explains, \u201cThe large pharma companies are not innovating at all,\u201d Springer says. \u201cThey\u2019re just buying things from other companies, or from academics.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>On May 12, Moderna announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had \u2018fast-tracked\u2019 its experimental COVID-19 vaccine, placing its regulatory review process on an accelerated timeline. Trump\u2019s coronavirus czar, Moncef Slaoui, had served on Moderna\u2019s board until his appointment on May 15. On May 18, he announced he would divest his $10 million in Moderna stock options, which he had previously tweeted posed no conflict of interest.</span></p> <p><span>On the same day as Slaoui\u2019s statement, Moderna announced that the vaccine\u2019s early human trials showed promising results. Findings based on the first eight volunteers suggested that the vaccine was safe. It will soon begin the next phase of human trials, which will involve 600 healthy people.</span></p> <p><span>Should its vaccine be taken to market, Moderna Therapeutics \u2014 and Springer, the company\u2019s founding investor \u2014 will strike gold again.</span></p> <p><span><em>\u2014 Staff writer Malaika K.

{"title": "\u2018Deeply Unlawful\u2019: Harvard Law School Faculty Condemn Trump\u2019s Response to Police Brutality Protests | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Kelsey J. Griffin", "body": "<p><span>Members of the Harvard Law School faculty published an open letter to students and Harvard affiliates Monday criticizing President Donald J. Trump for calling for a military response to ongoing protests against police brutality.</span></p> <p><span>The letter received signatures from 160 faculty members, including former Law School Dean Martha L. Minow and former United States Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha J. Power. It was reopened for signatures on June 2 after requests from additional Law School teaching faculty and law librarians.</span></p> <p><span>The authors of the letter denounced a tweet posted by Trump on May 29 which included the phrase \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d in reference to nationwide protests following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. They argue the president\u2019s language encourages violence by private citizens.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBy legitimating lawless action by public officials, the President\u2019s tweet invites other individuals to take similarly destructive action,\u201d the letter reads.</span></p> <p><span>The White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p> <p><span>Law School professor Christine A. Desan, who worked on drafting the letter, said Trump\u2019s tweet signified a commitment to using violence against citizens involved in the protest. She said she finds the message problematic since Trump speaks as the Commander in Chief of the Army.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe don't under our Constitution live in a society where even if somebody is stealing something they get shot,\u201d she said. \u201cTo have him pledge to use excessive state violence against people indiscriminately is really unlawful \u2014 deeply unlawful.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The letter also states Trump borrowed the phrase in his tweet from former Miami police chief Walter E. Headley, who supported police brutality during the Civil Rights Era. Desan said that the phrase\u2019s tie to a previous era of white-on-black violence demonstrates Trump intended to call for violent action against citizens.</span></p> <p><span>Professor Kenneth W. Mack \u2014 who also authored the letter \u2014 echoed similar concerns about the historical interpretation of the phrase.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt seems to be saying quite correctly that \u2018if I sent in the military, they will act in a way that the segregationist sheriff promised he would act the 1960s, which is to shoot people as a deterrent, to deter from them from protesting,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat would seem to breach the fundamental principles of democratic governance.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The faculty wrote in the letter that the military holds a responsibility to protect civil order \u2014 a principle Trump would violate by using federal authority against protestors.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere are rules for the deployment of the military,\u201d Mack said. \u201cWe don't shoot people for protesting.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Desan argued that by sending in the military, the President would exceed the authority of his office and breach his responsibility to minimize the force and use of the army.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt's not Donald Trump's army,\u201d she said. \u201cThe President can only use what force we've delegated, what authority we've delegated to him.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic Director Deborah E. Anker, who signed the letter, noted the importance of the large number of faculty members who supported the letter.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is so important to highlight these actions of the President that are divisive, anti-democratic and encourage hatred and violence, including private violence,\u201d she wrote in an emailed statement.</span></p> <p><span>Devos also noted the rare and \u201cstriking\u201d unity among the Law School faculty, a group commonly rife with ideological disagreements.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt's a forceful message from a group of people who might not agree on much at all but agree that this conduct crossed a very profound and important line,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that it reacted at this moment, I think, is a real message that deeply troubling conduct occurred.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mack said he hopes students who read the letter realize their professors aim to teach them how to act against injustice and defend the fundamental principles of the legal system, rather than simply teaching them the technical details of law.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe're not just teaching our students tactical principles of law,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are hopefully teaching and setting an example about how to be responsible citizens \u2014 lawyers specifically \u2014 in a democracy.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He added that lawyers especially carry a responsibility to uphold the rule of law and speak out against injustice \u2014 a duty that motivated the group of faculty members to join together.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe protests were set in motion by an act of lawlessness, and the President of United States has responded by promoting, recommending, and pledging to engage in further lawlessness,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the reason we felt the need to speak up.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Kelsey J.

Students who receive degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math fields may also apply for an additional 24 month extension, known as the STEM Extension.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cExperiential learning is an important practical experience as well as a recruitment tool for those seeking to welcome top talent,\u201d Bacow wrote.</span></p> <p><span>He noted that the program is also \u201cvital to the healthcare system,\u201d since medical schools often use the extension to support first-year residency programs.</span></p> <p><span>Bacow also cited increased competition for top students and declining enrollments at colleges and universities nationwide as reasons to safeguard the programs. Experts have said increased restrictions on international travel could result in further financial tumult for American higher education.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe loss of OPT threatens to erode our ability to enroll the best and brightest,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSimilar and competitive programs exist in many other countries, and we risk losing out.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bacow also advocated for a few specific changes \u2014 such as waiving in-person interviews \u2014 as the government develops its plans to resume visa processing and address backlogs that may have accrued as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.</span></p> <p><span>He also cautioned the administration against \u201cblunt measures that seek to exclude international scholars and students based on national origin.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNot only do these policies threaten to undermine our national ideals and core institutional values of openness and inclusivity, they threaten to cut off the United States from the global scientific community in critical fields of science and scholarship,\u201d he wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Trump enacted a controversial travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries in 2017.</span></p> <p><span>In January, as the threat of the novel coronavirus loomed, Trump blocked entry to the United States from China for 14 days. In March, he also implemented a 30-day travel ban on 26 European nations.</span></p> <p><span>In June 2019, Bacow <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/7/17/bacow-letter-immigration-pompeo/\">wrote to</a> Pompeo and then-Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin K.

Biden Jr., the Democratic Party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, to remove former University President Lawrence H. Summers as an economic advisor.</span></p> <p><span>Bloomberg News reported Thursday that Summers, who served in the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, was advising the Biden campaign on economic policy. Appearing on Bloomberg Television\u2019s \u201cWall Street Week\u201d Friday, Summers characterized his role with the campaign as informal.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t over-read things,\u201d Summers said. \u201cThe vice president and I have been friends for a long time and I\u2019m one of many, many people who his campaign talks to, but I don\u2019t have any formal relationship to his campaign.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Summers, who is a University Professor, previously served as the director of the White House National Economic Council for Obama. He also worked as the 71st Secretary of the Treasury for Clinton, and as the chief economist of the World Bank.</span></p> <p><span>The Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats, both of which endorsed United States Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over Biden in the Democratic primary, released a petition Friday calling for Summers\u2019s ouster.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cJoe Biden has a major trust gap that he must overcome with progressives and voters under 45 who voted overwhelmingly against him in the primary and who he\u2019ll need to defeat Trump,\u201d they wrote. \u201cLarry Summers\u2019 legacy is advocating for policies that contributed to the skyrocketing inequality and climate crisis we\u2019re living with today.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Summers did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p> <p><span>The calls to remove Summers come as Biden is taking a leftward turn on some policy issues in a bid to win over progressives. Following Sanders\u2019 departure from the race earlier this month, Biden rolled out a proposal to lower the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60. He also called for student debt forgiveness for middle- and low-income Americans who attended public colleges and universities, as well as Historically Black Colleges and Universities.</span></p> <p><span>Still, some groups like Harvard College Democrats for Bernie <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/17/harvard-for-bernie-rejects-biden/\">have declined to endorse Biden</a>, citing the sexual assault allegation he faces from Tara Reade, a former staff member in his Senate office. Biden denies the claim.</span></p> <p><span>Progressives have criticized Summers, claiming that his economic policies are too centrist for what Biden\u2019s campaign has repeatedly said will be the most progressive presidential campaign in years.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Jasper G.

Groopman, a professor of medicine at the Medical School and staff writer for the New Yorker, said in an interview that experts\u2019 use of social media can have a positive effect on informing the public, as long as the information they spread is accurate and significant.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between clickbait, which takes a non-scientific, non-evidence-based, non-expert, inflammatory declaration, or out of context, versus someone who feels that his or her voice is important particularly in countering either misinformation or an argument that\u2019s being made strictly from a political expediency point of view,\u201d Groopman said.</span></p> <p><span>He added that the public should still be wary of the types of information about COVID-19 they accept due to the rushed nature of research and media about the virus.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s a very challenging time with regard to the general public for several reasons,\u201d Groopman said. \u201cFirst of all, the usual filters for quality information have been removed. So, that peer review, scientific assessment which typically filters out for quality data, have been lagging behind so that certain groups will post their results before they\u2019re published or even peer-reviewed.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>With more than 173,000 Twitter followers, Lipsitch has used his platform to offer clarifications on news reports he believes are misinformed \u2014 namely, misrepresentations of his own quotes.</span></p> <p><span>For instance, in a Thursday tweet, Lipsitch wrote that his quote in a Bloomberg News article about the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in India was \u201cwildly unrepresentative\u201d of what he had said during the interview.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt misrepresents my views worse than almost any article I have ever been quoted in,\u201d Lipsitch wrote in the tweet.</span></p> <p><span>Lipsitch also recently shared a blog post by SciLine, a service connecting journalists and scientists, which offered scientists tips on communicating with the media during a \u201cmuch needed\u201d time.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhile this sudden increase in appetite for scientific expertise is in some respects refreshing, it has also resulted in a number of scientists being flooded with media requests, including those with little or no training in best practices for speaking to reporters,\u201d the SciLine blog post reads.</span></p> <p><span>Other Harvard professors, meanwhile, have used the impact of social media to dispel non-scientists\u2019 unfounded claims about the virus.</span></p> <p><span>Michael J.

{"title": "Politicians and Harvard Miss the Mark on CARES Act | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "The Crimson Editorial Board", "body": "<p><span>Immediately upon discovering that Harvard could receive almost $9 million under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, many politicians, including President Donald Trump, expressed outrage. Senator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1252297292964663298\">Ted Cruz</a> (R-Texas) took to Twitter: \u201cDear Harvard: Thank you for my law degree and an excellent legal education. You\u2019re very rich; many people are hurting. Now give the money back.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Before throwing punches, perhaps the senator should have used this \u201cexcellent legal education\u201d to read the bill he voted for. The bill, since being enacted into law as the CARES Act, automatically allocated the University $8.6 million in financial relief. Harvard did <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Harvard/status/1253043752005844993\">not apply</a> for, nor request, this aid.</span></p> <p><span>Still, many seemed eager to perpetuate the false narrative that Harvard single-handedly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenRickScott/status/1252994823696646150\">stripped money</a> from the hands of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/21/politics/trump-fact-check-april-21/index.html\">small businesses</a>. Trump himself demanded Harvard return the money \u201cmeant for workers.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>To be clear, the money was not meant for workers. Harvard, an institution of higher education, was to receive money meant for institutions of higher education.</span></p> <p><span>However, Harvard did subsequently <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/23/harvard-coronavirus-not-accepting-cares-act/\">reject</a> its allocated money.</span></p> <p><span>The aid in question was drawn from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund section of the CARES stimulus, which allocated nearly <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/15/harvard-coronavirus-cares-act/\">$14 billion</a> exclusively for higher education institutions \u2014 not small businesses. Harvard\u2019s allocated aid was calculated by a formula specified by the bill taking into account an institution\u2019s number of Pell Grant recipients and its enrollment \u2014 not its endowment. Even U.S. Secretary of Education <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-devos-calls-wealthy-institutions-reject-taxpayer-emergency-funds-congress-change-eligibility\">Betsy D. DeVos</a> admitted that \u201cCongress required taxpayer Emergency Relief funds be given to all colleges and universities, no matter their wealth.\u201d Despite this, many <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/21/harvard-stimulus-funds-financial-aid/\">members of Congress</a> cited Harvard\u2019s endowment in their demonization of the University.</span></p> <p><span>We find their accusations of Harvard to be a gross mischaracterization and an ill-informed attack on higher education, likely made with hopes of political gain. But more puzzlingly, they are a bizarre demonization of their own legislative choices. After all, all but one of the politicians attacking Harvard seem to have conveniently forgotten that they were the ones who voted for the stimulus package. We appreciate the hastiness of legislation in crisis, but come on, own your vote!</span></p> <p><span>Other institutions were allocated massive sums of money under the CARES Act as well; Columbia University and Cornell University netted $12.8 million each, a sum both currently intend to keep. The emphasis on Harvard seems to be more rhetorical \u2014 a farcical grab at anti-Harvard sentiment \u2014 than anything else.</span></p> <p><span>Why not call out other schools? Liberty University, which is known for being <a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/jerry-falwell-jr-plays-gay-students-suffer-universitys-conversion-therapy-20200122\">openly</a> <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/02/27/liberty-and-bob-jones-universities-may-run-afoul-obama-title-ix-protections-lgbt\">hostile</a> to members of the BGLTQ community and has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/us/politics/coronavirus-liberty-university-falwell.html\">endangered</a> its community members by reopening the campus in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis, was allocated $15 million.

{"title": "Harvard Law Experts Say Immigration Suspension Will Harm Children and DACA Recipients | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Kelsey J. Griffin", "body": "<p><span>Harvard Law School immigration experts said a recent executive order suspending immigration to the United States will especially harm young children and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients.</span></p> <p><span>United States President Donald Trump issued the order on April 22, pausing immigration for a 60-day period with certain exceptions, including for health care workers temporarily migrating to assist with the ongoing pandemic. Its aim is to preserve healthcare resources and jobs for American citizens, according to the order.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn the administration of our Nation\u2019s immigration system, we must be mindful of the impact of foreign workers on the United States labor market, particularly in an environment of high domestic unemployment and depressed demand for labor,\u201d it reads.</span></p> <p><span>Law School professor Gerald L. Neuman \u201973 \u2014 who teaches immigration and nationality law\u2014 called the order an abuse of power that would separate the children of permanent residents from their families. The proclamation includes an exception for children under the age of 21, but only if their parents are U.S. citizens.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe proclamation appears to use the current crisis as a pretext for imposing limitations that the White House has proposed in the past and that Congress has shown no interest in adopting,\u201d Neuman wrote in an email. \u201cMoreover, even on its own stated rationale, there is no conceivable justification for suspending the immigration of young children of lawful permanent residents.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The executive order also contains an exception for those already living in the county seeking naturalization.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic staff attorney Jason M. Corral said he thinks that exception significantly limits the order\u2019s scope.</span></p> <p><span>He added, however, that the suspension could incite xenophobia by directing blame for the economic crisis and high unemployment on immigrants. Corral also noted that the Trump administration issued the order shortly before the Supreme Court is expected to rule on the constitutionality of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which offers temporary protections to hundreds of thousands of qualified undocumented youth across the country.</span></p> <p><span>In Oct. 2019, Harvard and 18 other colleges and universities <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/5/daca-amicus-brief/\">filed</a> an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in support of DACA, warning its termination would damage the institutions\u2019 recruitment and retention of undocumented students.</span></p> <p><span>Corral explained that many DACA recipients receive permanent residency through a procedure called consular processing, in which a case is reviewed at a U.S. embassy abroad.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe've seen some students be able to take advantage of implementing this, and they have to leave the country and come back in and process from the embassy abroad,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>With the executive order suspending the processing of cases abroad, Corral voiced concerns that DACA recipients could lose another avenue to achieve residency.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAt the same time that we're seeing the possibility of DACA being taken away, it's also eliminating the opportunity for those folks to regularize their status in such a way where they would no longer need DACA,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell Law School, echoed similar concerns in an online statement. He contends the executive order is likely to encounter legal challenges.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAn executive order suspending all immigration into the United States is outrageous and likely unconstitutional,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe have never done that before, even during world wars.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Corral said that the United States should not impose harsh restrictions or uproot immigrants during a time of crisis.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe should be trying to make sure that people are able to stay and continue working and help rebound the economy once we all do get back to work,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Kelsey J.

{"title": "Bacow: Title IX Changes Require a Trip to Washington | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "The Crimson Editorial Board", "body": "<p><span>As the United States Department of Education continues to delegitimize victims of sexual violence, Harvard will need to step up more than ever.</span></p> <p><span>On Wednesday, the Department of Education released <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/5/8/experts-on-new-title-ix-rules/\">new rules for the enforcement of Title IX</a> \u2014 a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational institutions that receive federal funding. In a radical departure from Obama-era guidelines, these new regulations restrict the definition of sexual misconduct, require schools to cross-examine alleged victims when investigating sexual misconduct allegations, and prohibit schools from investigating sexual assault claims that occur at off-campus locations outside of their control. This last change effectively ties Harvard\u2019s hands in investigating misconduct occurring in social settings like final clubs, though a stunning 2016 report found that <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/3/9/report-lambasts-final-clubs/\">47 percent</a> of senior women who associated with these spaces experienced nonconsensual sexual contact.</span></p> <p><span>The effect these changes will have on sexual misconduct reporting is chilling. Redefining sexual assault as \u201cunwelcome conduct that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\u201d is a move that inevitably takes agency away from alleged sexual misconduct victims. Why force a victim to endure abuse long enough for it to become pervasive, and dire enough for it to become severe, before their Title IX complaint is considered valid?</span></p> <p><span>We also worry about what sort of behavior the Trump administration, whose figurehead has written off his own bragging about sexual assault as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/12/trump-timeline-sexual-misconduct-allegations-defense-292146\">locker room talk</a>,\u201d would define as \u201cobjectively offensive.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>By requiring a higher severity of sexual offense to be committed before formal action can be taken and removing victim protections, these new stipulations make a flawed system much worse. Raising the barrier to entry for investigations into sexual assault claims, when many victims already do not trust the institution enough to come forward, will only serve to exacerbate the underreporting of sexual misconduct. To make matters yet worse, alleged victims will be cross-examined and allegations made in sexual misconduct cases may now be freely and publicly discussed by both parties, opening the door to the interrogation and intimidation of survivors.</span></p> <p><span>We call on University President Lawrence S. Bacow to publicly condemn these regulations and to champion survivors' rights in Washington, D.C., as he has done before in opposition to the Trump administration\u2019s immigration reforms. Harvard must use its institutional heft against these changes, which threaten the safety of many students at Harvard as well as on other campuses. This is not a fringe issue. As of 2019, <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/15/aau-survey-results/\">one-third</a> of Harvard undergraduate women said they experienced nonconsensual sexual contact. To fail to strongly combat these changes to how sexual assault is handled \u2014 changes <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/12/14/bacow-devos-title-ix-changes/\">Bacow agrees</a> work against victims \u2014 would be to let students down. Further, we urge President Bacow to work with the Office of the General Counsel to circumvent and challenge how these regulations will be implemented on our campus as much as legally possible.</span></p> <p><span>These changes to how sexual assault cases are handled will inevitably affect student life. Students who have experienced unwelcome sexual contact at a final club who can no longer have their complaints investigated by the Title IX office, which is far more accessible than a police station, may feel deterred from accessing resources to cope with their trauma. Fearing interrogation and the emotional toll likely associated, many victims may also choose to not report.</span></p> <p><span>In response, the University should work independently to increase the availability of education, prevention, and support resources outside of Title IX proceedings. We urge Harvard to better train tutors and proctors to navigate issues of sexual misconduct and become trusted resources and advocates for survivors in light of Title IX\u2019s gutting. The University should also continue to highlight and expand counseling for victims of sexual harassment and assault, including through <a href=\"https://osapr.harvard.edu/links/response-peer-counseling\">RESPONSE</a> peer counseling and Counseling and Mental Health Services, and work to improve preventative measures.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard must also, as soon as possible, clarify to students and other affiliates how the new Title IX rules change existing policies and procedures. We call on the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response alongside President Bacow to outline the policy for affiliates in a clear and direct email. Students need to know what these changes mean for them.</span></p> <p><span>These regulations may be the final word from the Department of Education, but their implications on campus have not been fully realized. As the Trump administration implements policies that harm sexual assault survivors, we need a University President that fiercely defends survivors\u2019 rights and invests in sexual assault prevention, education, and counseling for all students.</span></p> <p><span><em>This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board.

{"title": "Harvard Does Not Have a $41 Billion Cayman Islands Account | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Harvard and its peer institutions recently came<a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/21/nation/trump-says-harvard-will-pay-back-86-million-stimulus-funds/\"> under fire</a> for being eligible to receive millions in federal aid under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Members of Congress, President Donald Trump, and many others<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/reneemorad/2020/04/21/harvard-under-fire-for-accepting-nearly-9-million-in-coronavirus-relief-funds/#59cf53085dd8\"> framed</a> the discussion as a choice between the financial health of Harvard\u2019s $41 billion endowment on the one hand and the jobs and lives of fellow Americans on the other.</span></p> <p><span>But it is dangerous to argue that because Harvard is rich, it should not be worrying about its finances. As Harvard\u2019s financial health deteriorates, the jobs and livelihoods of thousands of taxpaying Americans will also be harmed over the next few years. Although the short-term benefits of prioritizing more vulnerable institutions and individuals outweigh the long-term costs, these costs are real and need to be included in the discussion.</span></p> <p><span>Even the $41 billion number, made public in June 2019, is misleading. There are serious legal and logistical hurdles involved in redirecting the more than 13,000 separate funds that make up the endowment for pandemic assistance. The vast majority of the endowment is<a href=\"https://www.harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance/endowment\"> restricted</a>, and each fund must be individually renegotiated with the donor if the funds are to be repurposed. More importantly, Harvard\u2019s financial health has taken a serious hit in the last few weeks. If the current economic downturn is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/19/harvard-coronavirus-endowment-impact/\">directly comparable</a>\u201d to the Great Recession, Harvard\u2019s endowment may be posed to lose more than $10 billion.</span></p> <p><span>But tens of billions of dollars is still a lot of money. That\u2019s why more than a third of Harvard\u2019s annual operating budget comes from endowment returns. For example, endowment returns funded 87 and 74 percent of the Radcliffe Institute and Harvard Divinity School<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/23/harvard-coronavirus-radcliffe-divinity-school-endowment-finances/\"> operating budgets</a> for 2019. At the same time that the endowment is plummeting, operating costs are increasing. Harvard\u2019s Faculty of Arts and Sciences is already <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/11/fas-loses-30-million-coronavirus/\">unable</a> to cover its budget for Fiscal Year 2020 due to $30 million in \u201cunforeseen expenses and lost revenue.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Therefore, like any other business still operating, the University will be forced to make drastic budget cuts across the board. Although the University is already<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/20/hollister-harvard-coronavirus-spending/\"> cutting</a> non-essential spending, there will almost certainly be hiring freezes and mass layoffs. For comparison, in the aftermath of the 2009 recession, Harvard<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/12/bacow-planning-next-recession/\"> reduced</a> food services staffing, tabled faculty salary increases, froze hiring, and laid off hundreds of employees. These cuts over the next few years will threaten the jobs and livelihoods of thousands of Americans. The most vulnerable populations on campus \u2014 staff workers, graduate students trying to<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/5/6/hgsu-harvard-one-year-contract/\"> negotiate</a> insurance benefits, and the 55 percent of undergraduates who depend on financial aid to afford tuition \u2014 will be the ones harmed the most. Every dollar Harvard loses today is two dollars it cannot spend to hire workers or fund scholarships down the line. And while costs will return to normal and Harvard\u2019s endowment will eventually recover, it will take time \u2014 Harvard\u2019s endowment didn\u2019t recover to pre-2008 levels until 2017.</span></p> <p><span>This doesn\u2019t mean that we should prioritize wealthy corporations over struggling small businesses and communities. In fact, I completely agree with Harvard\u2019s decision not to accept federal aid. But we need to recognize that Harvard\u2019s decision will, without a doubt, hurt its ability to help its employees and students stay safe and put food on the table in five years.</span></p> <p><span>The CARES Act won\u2019t be the last time that we have to choose between the long-term financial health of wealthy institutions and the short-term wellbeing of fellow Americans. While it seems absurd to be thinking about how much money a nameless investment management company is making during a pandemic, we need to remember that the long-term financial health of universities such as Harvard directly affects the livelihoods of thousands of individuals \u2014 even if the consequences will not be apparent until later. This doesn\u2019t mean we should bail out every wealthy company. Rather, we need to avoid knee-jerk reactions that equate wealth with excess and include the long-term costs of reduced financial health in our decision-making.</span></p> <p><span><em>Maxwell L.

{"title": "What Coronavirus Should Tell Us about How We Eat Meat | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last week, President Donald Trump effectively forced meatpacking plants around the country to remain open during the pandemic by signing an executive order designating them as \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201d Interestingly, the president has declined to use the same justification to speed the production of coronavirus tests and personal protective equipment.</span></p> <p><span>The industry always keeps plenty of meat in frozen storage, and because of restaurant closures we are going through this supply less quickly. Thus, the choice to keep meatpacking plants open is not attributable to the \u201ccritical\u201d nature of the meat industry. Rather, it is more likely due to a deep-seated association between eating meat and our national identity. After all, America consumes more meat per capita than any other country. Even before this pandemic, our habits had negative consequences for animals, the environment, our public health, and workers in processing plants \u2014 but the virus might be worsening the effects. So, in times like these, rethinking that association may be necessary for our collective well-being.</span></p> <p><span>For months, coronavirus has been spreading around meat processing plants, leading a few of them to close. To date, thousands of meatpacking workers have tested positive, and over a dozen have died. Even before the virus, meatpacking was a difficult job. Workers toil in factories described as crowded and unsafe; conditions are so harsh that it often leads to permanent physical disability. These workers also disproportionately come from vulnerable immigrant communities that might already be more susceptible to the virus.</span></p> <p><span>The animals in these plants are also a source of concern. It\u2019s no secret that the American meat industry doesn\u2019t value animal welfare. The scenes from factory farms are truly awful \u2014 cattle raised in contained animal feeding operations, chickens bred to have breasts so large that they can no longer stand. Animals larger than humans are forced to spend most of their lives in darkness, confined to a few feet of space. Under ordinary circumstances, the lives of factory farm animals are miserable and short.</span></p> <p><span>And this situation is deteriorating further due to the virus. Because processing has slowed, there are now a lot of animals with nowhere to go. Thus, farmers are left with no choice but to kill the animals en masse. Aside from the obvious waste, what\u2019s troubling is that animals might actually suffer more in these methods of extermination than they would otherwise. Chickens, for example, are essentially drowned by filling barns with watery foam. In the coming weeks, millions of animals will be slaughtered not for consumption, but to make room for others.</span></p> <p><span>These meat carcasses, disturbingly enough, might just be dumped in landfills. As their bodies decay, they will release massive quantities of methane and carbon dioxide, directly contributing to climate change. Food waste worsens the meat industry\u2019s already severe environmental impact, and in a scenario where slaughterhouses are operating at 50 percent capacity, that seems likely to increase.</span></p> <p><span>Another frequently underestimated consequence of the meat industry is its propensity for creating and spreading disease. This isn\u2019t strictly limited to meatpacking plants themselves, though sickness has been known to spread quickly in such conditions. Rampant antibiotic use and the crowded and unsanitary state of farms also means that disease can quickly evolve and spread among animals \u2014 and even make the leap to humans. Antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria and zoonotic diseases flourish in our factory farms. The Food and Agriculture Organization, a branch of the United Nations, has warned about the health dangers of industrial agriculture before. As far as we know, coronavirus didn\u2019t come from animal agriculture, but it\u2019s worth highlighting that deadly pathogens often come from animals. The way we raise our food is unnecessarily contributing to an increased risk that another pandemic will emerge in the future.</span></p> <p><span>There\u2019s an obvious solution to these problems: Eat less meat, and choose the meat you do eat more carefully. Doing right by workers, animals, and the environment doesn\u2019t necessitate vegetarianism, though it probably means scaling back consumption. When possible, we should purchase ethically-raised meat from smaller farms, and support retailers and farmers who participate in responsible agriculture. Moreover, we should make a deliberate effort to eat meat less often. If the rest of the world is any indication, we can survive perfectly well with a few more vegetables. The way we eat meat is unsustainable; the pandemic is just making that irresponsibility more obvious.</span></p> <p><span><em>Rebecca E.J. Cadenhead \u201823 lives in Canaday Hall.

Isselbacher", "body": "<p><span><strong>UPDATED: April 9, 2020, 3:38 p.m.</strong></span></p> <p><span>After the White House recently cleared U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos\u2019s new proposed Title IX rule last week, DeVos is free to issue the new guidelines at any time \u2014 a decision that legal experts have criticized amid the coronavirus crisis.</span></p> <p><span>In November 2018, DeVos proposed the new rule for colleges and universities that receive federal funding. The <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/27/title-ix-explainer/\">rule</a> would require those colleges and universities to cross-examine witnesses when formally investigating allegations of sexual misconduct, among a number of other significant changes to Title IX procedures.</span></p> <p><span>DeVos\u2019s initial proposal was followed by a public comment period that lasted until Jan. 30, 2019. The Department of Education received more than 100,000 comments in that period \u2014 including <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/1/28/harvard-devos-title-ix-changes/\">criticisms submitted by Harvard</a> in conjunction with a coalition of other universities.</span></p> <p><span>Federal law requires the DOE to read every comment submitted; given the large volume of feedback, the release of the guidelines was stalled for months during the extensive review period.</span></p> <p><span>After the DOE read the comments, the White House\u2019s Office of Budget and Management undertook a review of the guidelines, which it completed on March 27, 2020, according to POLITICO.</span></p> <p><span>An Education Department spokesperson declined to comment on when the rule would be published.</span></p> <p><span>The Trump administration\u2019s forward movement on the rule, meanwhile, has elicited criticism from Title IX experts \u2014 including Harvard Law School professor Janet E. Halley and lecturer Diane L. Rosenfeld.</span></p> <p><span>Halley said in an interview she feels the DOE should stall policy changes while universities grapple with emergent problems posed by the ongoing pandemic.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that this is a terrible time to introduce demanding new guidelines,\u201d Halley said. \u201cThe faculty and administrators and students all over the country are trying their hardest right now to catch up with the changes because of the pandemic.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Rosenfeld, who lectures on gender violence and legal policy at HLS, similarly criticized the decision. At Harvard, the pandemic led to a <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/11/harvard-coronavirus-classes-cancelled/\">sudden University-wide switch</a> to online classes last month, with most students being sent off campus and in-person operations largely halting.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that it is an inopportune time to drop the comments right now when schools are just struggling to figure out how best to serve their students in the face of this diaspora of students,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>Rosenfeld added that she believes that, by clearing the way for the guidelines\u2019 release amid the pandemic, the Trump administration is exploiting the fact that colleges and universities are overwhelmed by other issues and may lack the bandwidth to address the policy changes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNew cases are not being brought, so it seems like there\u2019s not an impetus to release the rule right now except to take advantage of the fact that people are occupied with survival questions and with getting through the rest of the semester,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I think it would almost be in bad faith to do it in a time like this.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The DOE did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the professors\u2019 criticisms.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard\u2019s Title IX Office, which will be in charge of implementing DeVos\u2019s new guidelines when they are released, declined to comment on the timeline update.</span></p> <p><span>University Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill said in an interview last Monday that Harvard\u2019s Title IX office has <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/31/harvard-coronavirus-title-ix/\">carried on its operations</a> remotely over the past few weeks and will continue to receive and address disclosures from students.</span></p> <p><span>Though the Title IX office and Office for Dispute Resolution will continue to function online, Halley pointed out that the switch from in-person to virtual communication might prove disruptive when it comes in the middle of an open Title IX case.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere are issues about online environments that are different than face-to-face environments,\u201d she said. \u201cFor instance, the inability of investigators to meet face-to-face, in person with people that they're interviewing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>To address such difficulties posed by social distancing, Rosenfeld said it might be beneficial for the DOE to release official guidance on how universities should proceed with Title IX investigations during the pandemic.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that schools would probably really appreciate guidance on what to do with existing cases,\u201d she said. \u201cI would think about doing an interim rule that specifically addresses the situation of what to do with hearings that are going on right now, how to do them in a fair way at a distance through Zoom, how to protect survivors and to make sure it\u2019s a fair process and that everyone gets heard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><strong><em>Correction: April 9, 2020</em></strong></span></p> <p><span><em>A previous version of the caption for this article incorrectly stated the current location of Harvard's Title IX Office.

I think some are worried about the health and safety of their families. Some clients work at jobs that put them at risk or no longer have jobs. They\u2019re worried about how they\u2019re going to pay rent. Other clients in detention fear the virus will spread quickly in detention facilities because people are in such close quarters. Everyone\u2019s working with fear and uncertainty.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM</strong>: As you mentioned, court proceedings for detained immigrants remain ongoing. What are they like in Boston?</span></p> <p><span><strong>SA</strong>: I haven\u2019t had a hearing in Boston in the past couple of weeks, but I know lawyers are allowed to appear telephonically, and detainees are appearing over video conferences. According to the American Immigration Lawyers Association, some people are still going to court in person and are told to supply their own protective gear.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM</strong>: How has the temporary delay on the cases for non-detained people impacted the clinic\u2019s cases?</span></p> <p><span><strong>SA</strong>: Sometimes people may benefit from the opportunity to collect more information and prepare for their cases. A lot of the time, though, people have been waiting years to have their cases heard; they\u2019ve prepared extensively. Rescheduling has left them in limbo. A number of cases the clinic is working on were supposed to have hearings this semester. Now they\u2019re put off, and we don\u2019t know when they will be rescheduled. There\u2019s a back-log of over a million cases in the immigration court system right now.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM</strong>: The Trump administration has announced plans to ban people from seeking asylum. What do you make of this response?</span></p> <p><span><strong>SA</strong>: Beyond the due process concerns, efforts to ban people from seeking asylum because of the virus directly contravene our obligations in both domestic and international law. The U.S., bound by the Refugee Convention Protocol of 1967, has an obligation to protect people who have a well-founded reason not to return to their home countries. You can\u2019t deny people the protections they deserve, even in times of crisis.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM</strong>: Has the clinic taken on particular advocacy positions in relation to the pandemic?</span></p> <p><span><strong>SA</strong>: We\u2019ve written several letters asking ICE officials to release people from detention, asking the immigration courts to take action to do the same, and asking the government to protect people\u2019s health and safety. My hope is that litigation and individual cases will help change the system.</span></p> <p><span>As of mid-March, the ACLU began filing suits against the federal government to release detainees due to concerns over the health of medically-vulnerable people in detention conditions. At the end of the month, the Southern Poverty Law Center joined with the ACLU of Louisiana to seek the immediate release of asylum seekers in Louisiana detention centers. Cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in Arizona, Texas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Louisiana detention centers.</span></p> <p><span><em>\u2014 Magazine writer Saima S.

{"title": "What the Hell Happened: Why are People Drawing Fruit on Instagram? | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Alexis J. Boo", "body": "<p><span>As people all around the world settle into the rhythm of working from home, social distancing, and self-quarantining due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an unforeseen situation has arisen as a consequence: the ascent of Instagram challenges. Without the time spent walking to and from class, travelling to work, or hanging out with friends, many young people have found themselves with an unprecedented number of unoccupied hours in their days. To fill this space, millennials and Gen Zers have turned to our trusty friend, Social Media.</span></p> <p><span>An Instagram challenge is typically some kind of task that a user fulfills, posts photo or video evidence of, and then tags a handful of friends, challenging them to do the same. These tasks are not a new phenomenon resulting from self-isolation, but the sheer number and increasing ridiculousness of them is.</span></p> <p><span>The first \u201cchallenge,\u201d which purportedly originated in India, implored users to draw an orange. The trend went viral globally, and suddenly images of all kinds of fruits and vegetables flooded people\u2019s stories on Instagram.</span></p> <p><span>Interestingly enough, an unexpected consequence of this phenomenon was its ability to reveal people\u2019s surprising creativity. A handful of users took a simple (i.e. boring) approach to their digital paintings, indicating a potato, for instance, with a solid, brown oval. Other potatoes contained facial features or arrays of anthropomorphic additions, with some paying homage to Mr. Potato Head himself. Drawings of oranges morphed into images of Donald Trump and then into the Lorax and back. People utilized full color palettes, livening up their masterpieces with attention to light and shadow, or took the easy route by throwing an emoji on their screen and calling it a day. The random people we follow on Instagram have appeared out of thin air to demonstrate their hidden artistic talents and then retreat into anonymity.</span></p> <p><span>But it didn\u2019t stop at drawing. Instagram users have taken on a number of challenges. The #10for10 pushup challenge features someone filming themselves doing 10 pushups and then tagging 10 friends to continue the chain. The \u201cUntil Tomorrow\u201d challenge, where users post embarrassing photos and keep them up for 24 hours, and the omelette-making challenge, which is self-explanatory, follow similar systems.</span></p> <p><span>While these trends are mostly borne out of boredom, they function as a tool for keeping our connections strong in the face of sudden isolation. Interaction is made easier for friends and family who now might be thousands of miles away. We can make fun of these increasingly silly challenges and get annoyed at their prevalence on our feeds, or we can appreciate how they allow us to maintain our relationships and add a bit of liveliness and humor to the otherwise dismal state of our current world.</span></p> <p><span>So, hey, although quarantine might be boring for most young adults right now, at least we can thank it for revealing the surprising artistic merits of our friends.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014 Staff writer Alexis J.

{"title": "What the Great War Can Teach Us about the Great Pandemic | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As a History concentrator, I\u2019m embarrassed to admit that two months ago I didn\u2019t know that the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918 had even existed. But the current pandemic has propelled this footnote of history into the limelight. As crises arise, it is perfectly natural that we scramble to find precedents. We need to learn from the past to fix the present. It can also be therapeutic to know that we\u2019ve survived something like this before.</span></p> <p><span>However, the Spanish flu is not an adequate precedent for the coronavirus. I believe the same time period offers us a better alternative: World War I. The Great War has many lessons to teach us as we navigate the Great Pandemic.</span></p> <p><span>Both World War I and this pandemic were unprecedented. This past February, newspaper headlines often referenced the SARS outbreak of 2003 and the Ebola outbreak of 2014. Similarly, in July 1914, as Austria-Hungary and Serbia went to war, Europeans hearkened back to the Crimean War of the 1850s and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. But, as the rest of Europe spiraled into total warfare in August 1914, it became clear that these short, restricted conflicts were not adequate precedents for the carnage to come. So too, have we already dismissed SARS and Ebola as too limited to serve as historical precedents for our current global pandemic.</span></p> <p><span>Precedent seekers in 1914 were forced to turn back more than a century to the Napoleonic Wars to examine what total war on the continent would look like. However, much had changed between 1814 and 1914 \u2014 the spread of nationalism and colonialism, the invention of machine guns and mortars, and the emancipation of Russian serfs. These developments led to many unanticipated consequences on the battlefield.</span></p> <p><span>We too have to look back over a century to find a pathogen as global, transmissible, and deadly as the current coronavirus. But just as the Napoleonic Wars could not prepare the masses in 1914 for the horrors of World War I, the Spanish flu can\u2019t teach us much today. Over the past century, our world globalized, geopolitics decentered, transportation and medicine progressed exponentially, and fake news and conspiracy theories prospered.</span></p> <p><span>World War I\u2019s exceptional nature is a better precedent for our times than the Spanish flu. The war killed over 20 million people, toppled mighty empires, led to the Ottoman genocide of the Armenian people, decimated Germany, created the first communist superpower, and contributed directly to WWII. One of the war\u2019s most important lessons is that we are likely to underplay the unprecedented. The English writer H.G. Wells wrote of 1914, \u201cAll Europe still remembers the strange atmosphere of those eventful sunny August days, the end of the Armed peace. For nearly half a century the Western world had been tranquil and had seemed safe\u2026 The newspapers spoke of a world catastrophe, but that conveyed very little meaning to those for whom the world had always seemed secure, who were indeed almost incapable of thinking it as otherwise than secure.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Our past half-century, like the one before WWI, has been relatively stable. We should not make the same mistake the British made in 1914 and assume this stability will last forever. While the coronavirus\u2019s effects are still largely uncertain, it could permanently change the world in unimaginable ways. Regimes may fall, death counts could spiral to millions, authoritarianism may flourish, and supply chains could be severed.</span></p> <p><span>The point of this article is not to fear-monger. Perhaps the world goes back to \u201cnormal\u201d in a few months\u2019 time. But, history teaches us to question our assumptions of constant stability. The world has unexpectedly changed dramatically before and it can do so again. Like WWI, this pandemic will surely end. The question is whether it will have permanent, drastic consequences.</span></p> <p><span>WWI teaches us that we should not focus on the little things as we prepare for a possible shakeup of the world order. In August 1914, British Chancellor David Lloyd George was deeply concerned with maintaining investor confidence to prevent a financial collapse. Likewise, newspaper headlines throughout March 2020 tracked stock market nosedives, while President Donald Trump downplayed the virus to shore up market confidence. Lloyd George would soon learn that a financial collapse was the least of his problems. Already, this April, we\u2019ve had a similar awakening as the headlines from Wall Street have been replaced by death tolls and horrific reports from heroic healthcare workers on the front lines.</span></p> <p><span>An obsession with the markets in August 1914 and March 2020 was an indication that the gravity of the situation was not understood. During both these periods, the world was stuck in the pre-crisis mental framework that market developments were all important. The unprecedented nature of the moment could not be grasped. As H.G. Wells wrote about Britain in August 1914, \u201cIt was like a man still walking about the world unaware that he has contracted a fatal disease which will alter every routine and habit in his life.\u201d Today, we have caught more than a metaphoric disease and history teaches us that it could change everything.</span></p> <p><span><em>Jonathan L.

{"title": "Responding to Coronavirus Financial Crisis, Harvard Graduate Students Seek Student Loan Relief | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Ellen M. Burstein", "body": "<p><span>With millions facing financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, President Donald Trump signed off on a $2 trillion relief package \u2014 the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act \u2014 last month. The legislation offers borrowers of federally-held student loans a reprieve from payments for six months, through Sept. 30, without accruing interest.</span></p> <p><span>Many graduate students at Harvard have private loans, however, not all of which offer comparable accommodations.</span></p> <p><span>Bryan O. Buckley, a student at the Harvard School of Public Health and the outgoing president of the Harvard Graduate Council, said he has both federal and private loans.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy wife and I both have student loans. All of her loans are federal loans and so she did get a reprieve,\u201d Buckley said. \u201cFor me, I have both federal loans, and also private loans. For my federal loans, that works. But as I'm entering into the job market, I'll have to start paying my loans back.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have quite a lot of private loans and so far they have not made any moves so far as to do anything to kind of help,\u201d he added.</span></p> <p><span>One such private lender for graduate students is the Harvard University Employees Credit Union, a non-profit financial cooperative exclusive to University staff, students, and alumni.</span></p> <p><span>Eugene J. \u201cGene\u201d Foley, the President and CEO of HUECU, said the institution is \u201cprobably\u201d the largest lender of student loans for Harvard graduate students.</span></p> <p><span>Foley said the Credit Union is making adjustments to loans on a case-by-case basis.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe will do interest rate reduction, we will do payment deferrals, we'll do a combination of things,\u201d Foley said. \u201cOur reps have been very busy as students have been calling in and seeking help, and we're trying to triage this on a case-by-case basis rather than just putting one program out there that's kind of a blanket fit.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Noelle G. Graham \u2014 a student at Harvard Law School who has taken out all her student loans with HUECU \u2014 wrote in an email that she feels the Credit Union\u2019s individualized approach could impose undue pressure on those struggling with their finances.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhile administering relief on a case-by-case basis offers flexibility to the institution, it raises uncertainty for those needing the relief,\u201d Graham wrote. \u201cIt also puts the onus on each individual to vigorously advocate for themselves. And those who need this relief the most are also likely those who are feeling the most exhausted and distressed right now.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Graham said she hopes the Credit Union will provide the same relief as the federal government due to \u201cextreme financial uncertainty\u201d posed by the coronavirus pandemic.</span></p> <p><span>Foley said the Credit Union is offering \u201ca lot\u201d of student loan relief comparable to federal programs. He also argued in favor of the individualized approach, noting that solutions could be \u201ca better fit\u201d if they are \u201ctailor-made\u201d to meet a particular student\u2019s needs.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe are doing a lot of the things that the federal government's doing, but we're doing them on a case-by-case basis to see if we can really help people out and figure things out,\u201d Foley said.</span></p> <p><span>Graham \u2014 a co-president of the Law School\u2019s student government \u2014 said that while she is not required to make payments until after she graduates in 2021, law students who are about to graduate are particularly concerned about paying back loans.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMany students at HLS work at private law firms after graduating, but if those firms decide to postpone their start date, then that may become a real issue for some people,\u201d Graham said. \u201cStudents going into public sector jobs are likely in an even more precarious position.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Foley said \u201cthe lion\u2019s share\u201d of recent requests for assistance coming to the Credit Union relate to student loans and mortgages. HUECU has also offered one-time skip-a-pay and three-month payment deferral options for consumer loans and personal loans.</span></p> <p><span>He said the Credit Union is adapting its financial relief for Harvard students and staff as the pandemic unfolds.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm not sure what the extent or the duration of this financial crisis is going to be, so we just wanted to get programs up and running out there, right away, that would help people,\u201d Foley said. \u201cAnd then we have centrally triaged the requests coming in, so that we can have a very good finger on the pulse in terms of what the problems are.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Ellen M.

{"title": "Portrait of an Artist: Sara Davis Buechner | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Charlotte A. Powell", "body": "<p><span>Concert pianist Sara Davis Buechner has been lauded by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/08/arts/music-debuts-review-three-pianists-bass-string-quartet-perform-recitals.html\">New York Times</a> for her \u201cintelligence, integrity and all-encompassing technical prowess.\u201d She currently serves on the piano faculty of Temple University and recently performed for the Longwood Symphony Orchestra at the New England Conservatory.</span></p> <p><span><strong>The Harvard Crimson</strong>: How did you get into music?</span></p> <p><span><strong>Sara Davis Buechner</strong>: I grew up in a house in Baltimore, where my parents were very poor. But my mother was very committed to my brother and I getting a good education and a very profound exposure to culture which she had been denied herself. We had a lot of good books in the house and piano lessons, and she used to take out these framed reproductions of masterpieces from the neighborhood library. She hung these all around the house. So I was surrounded by copies of Gauguin and Renoir.</span></p> <p><span>When I was a teenager, we would visit Washington and we'd always go to the art museums, especially the National Gallery. And I figured early on that the colors in those paintings were a visual representation of the colors I was trying to make in music.</span></p> <p><span><strong>THC</strong>: Do you think that the art that we call \u201cgreat\u201d needs to be \u201cgood?\u201d</span></p> <p><span><strong>SDB</strong>: I was quite inspired in reading the obituaries one day, which I do religiously. I'm guessing this is a good 15 to 20 years ago now, there was a conductor named Franz Allers. I was surprised he had a pretty sizable obit at the time, but I'd never heard of him. They went on to describe that he was a German or Austrian musician who, like many others, had emigrated to the United States during World War II to escape with his life for being Jewish. And when he got to New York, he just couldn't get much employment and he ended up conducting a lot of Broadway pit orchestras. He conducted most of the great Lerner-Loewe musicals that we know, like \u201cMy Fair Lady.\u201d And he was asked that question, and he said, \u201cthere is no first and second rate music, there are only first and second rate performances.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><strong>THC</strong>: Why do you read the obituaries every day?</span></p> <p><span><strong>SDB</strong>: I guess I could say, sadly, that I probably formed that habit in the early 1980s when I lived in New York City. It was right after I had gotten out of Juilliard and played the New York debut, and I'm starting my performance career. At that time, I was associated with the Baldwin piano. Now the Baldwin Piano Company has since gone out of business, sad to say. After Baldwin went under, I started to play the Yamaha piano, and I'm still a Yamaha artist. Many pianists don't have a piano affiliation, they just play anything they like. If you have an affiliation with a piano company, then you try to play that piano whenever you can.</span></p> <p><span>There was a wonderful man who ran the artists\u2019 relations department of Baldwin named Jack Romano. Jack was beloved by everybody in the business \u2014 he was a delightful, charming man. He was in his mid 50s, at that time, I think, with a model's red hair and an appetite for drink and other otherworldly exaltations. He would have bridge parties, and he had the great jazz pianist George Shearing come over. George Shearing was blind \u2014 he wore dark glasses. He'd always say to George, \"God dammit, stop peeking at my cards!\" I just adored Jack. Everybody did. And one day my manager called me and said, \u201cI want you to take some time to go see Jack. He's in the hospital.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And I said, \"What's wrong?\" He says, \"Well, nobody really knows. But you know, he'll be okay. He\u2019ll be out soon.\" I went to see him and indeed, Jack didn't know what was wrong with him. Doctors wouldn't tell him much, and Jack stayed in that hospital and he got sicker and sicker and sicker. And I've never forgotten \u2014 I think it was the last time I saw him. I went to the hospital. His eyes were closed. He was hardly communicative. I asked him, was there anything I could do from him? He said, \"Can you please give me a shave? The nurses won't shave me.\" Oh, okay. Sure. So, I took a straight razor and I gave him a shave and of course, I nicked him one or two places and wiped the blood off and when I got home, I had a panic attack because people were talking about this funny disease that was transmitted in blood.</span></p> <p><span>I called the gay men's health crisis center to talk to someone who soothed me and said, \u201cLook, wash your hands. Get yourself tested in a few weeks; don't panic, it'll probably be okay.\u201d And, of course, Jack was one of the first people I knew who died of AIDS.</span></p> <p><span>Around that time, in early 1980s, I think I developed that habit of looking at obituaries because first it was once a month, you'd hear that this pianist died or that composer died or this dancer died. And then it was once a week, then almost daily. You\u2019d pick up the New York Times and there would be some young creative person dead and then it was a 21-year-old classmate of mine from Juilliard. It was horrifying. And the Reagan administration, like the Trump administration, was so ignorant of medicine; They wouldn't do anything. Nobody seemed to care.</span></p> <p><span><strong>THC</strong>: I\u2019m kind of curious \u2014 if you had to write your own obituary, what would the first sentence be?</span></p> <p><span><strong>SDB</strong>: Oh my god. I would write, \u201cSara Davis, the greatest pianist of all time.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>I'm not gonna answer that question. Somebody else has got to do it, right?</span></p> <p><span>What I don't want it to say is \u201ctransgender pianist,\u201d and I'm almost certain that the New York Times, if and when I pass away, will say, \u201cSara Davis Buechner, transgender pianist, died at age,\u201d you know, whatever. It's not because I'm at all unhappy with that title. It's just that I hope by the time I die, that being trans is something that is fully just known and accepted and not spectacular. I think the word may have to be part of my obit because I guess I was a pioneer in terms of just being out about that. Being very open about my transition. So that's okay. I mean, I'm proud of that, to have inspired a lot of young people to come backstage and say, \"you gave me a little courage\" or \"I was inspired by your story.\"</span></p> <p><span>But my whole life, ever since I was a little kid, has always been about playing Mozart. I'd be less than honest if I didn't say there's a little bit of anger deep inside me. I still cope with it every day \u2014 having to prove myself not just once or twice or three times in my life, but many, many times over because, you know, people either couldn't cope with that or are baffled by it. When I went off to Boston, I hadn't been to Boston in many, many years. I saw some people who I'd known who I hadn't seen in 20 years. They hadn\u2019t seen me as a female before. They got right back into the swing of calling me the wrong name, the wrong pronouns and everything until I caught them.</span></p> <p><span>It's very confusing, probably. But I feel like you've had 20 years to practice this. What's so damn tough about it? So you realize you're still fighting something and standing up for something that maybe most people don't encounter in their life. I'm sure they don't mean anything malevolent for the most part.</span></p>"}

Set for release on July 14, 2020, this book will undoubtedly shift readers\u2019 perspectives on the complexities of a deceptively simple term.</span></p> <p><span>Marjorie Garber, a Harvard professor of English and Visual and Environmental Studies, has written 18 single-authored books \u2014 six of which are about Shakespeare \u2014 and has edited seven collections. As a veteran of the genre, and with such an extensive background, it comes as no surprise that Garber\u2019s book is eloquently composed.</span></p> <p><span>Garber\u2019s discussion of character renders the term such a monumental force that it seems impossible to cover all aspects of its meaning. Still, she manages to successfully tap on the significance of character in almost every dimension. Across eight chapters, Garber analyzes character in sports, media, psychoanalysis, art, and science, among other categories. With almost 40 pages of references, Garber pulls in a variety of work generated by other academics, as well as events that exemplify the significance of character in society, to substantiate her own analyses.</span></p> <p><span>The most relevant and impactful components of Garber\u2019s book bring the focus of character out of fictional literature and into the real world. Garber centers her argument around politics throughout the book, with a particular spotlight on President Donald Trump. Garber approaches the subject without holding back; in her first chapter, \u201cTesting It,\u201d which focuses on the prevalence of \u201ccharacter tests\u201d in different career fields, Garber criticizes Trump\u2019s questionable character and the unsurprising failure of the character test. Garber\u2019s political analyses offer worthwhile insight into the 2016 presidential election and Trump\u2019s time in office, as well as the upcoming 2020 presidential election. This discussion of politics also incites the occasional chuckle, as when Garber juxtaposes presidential efforts to maintain good moral character with immoral acts and unnecessarily rude claims. Her criticisms are sharp yet logically supported in such a way that even the most conservative grandparent at a big family dinner couldn\u2019t argue against them.</span></p> <p><span>Garber\u2019s book also has an unforgettable chapter focused on national character called \u201cClaiming It,\u201d a section rendered more pertinent than ever amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The concept of a country\u2019s \u201cnational character\u201d is nothing new, but it becomes increasingly apparent during times of change and anxiety. Unfortunately, what is portrayed as a unifying idea often causes much conflict. Garber claims that the metaphor of the United States as a \u201cmelting pot\u201d has become dead in the water in light of contemporary immigration issues, and this national hostility towards diversity can explain underlying racial tensions that may worsen the world\u2019s current pandemic. \u201cClaiming It\u201d is an excellent deconstruction of American superiority, emphasizing the importance of national character as an identity that should be more inclusive than elite.</span></p> <p><span>The point of this book is not to provide a clear-cut definition of \u201ccharacter,\u201d but rather to highlight the many definitions and plethora of roles that character can play. Gardner even ends some of her sub-chapters with questions, leaving the reader to ponder the evidence presented. The incorporation of these queries makes the book even more thought-provoking, prompting readers to reconsider everything they thought they knew about the meaning of character. Garber is wise to not merely spout answers and claims at the audience \u2014 instead, she leaves room for interpretation and thought after arriving at the book\u2019s end.</span></p> <p><span>While sophisticated and filled to the brim with academic references, Garber\u2019s book effectively makes the content accessible and interesting. \u201cCharacter: The History of a Cultural Obsession\u201d exemplifies Garber\u2019s many areas of expertise, interacting well with other works to ultimately leave readers with a clarified perspective and new method of analyzing the complicated workings of society.</span></p>"}

Burstein", "body": "<p><span><strong>UPDATED: April 21, 2020, 7:24 p.m.</strong></span></p> <p><span>United States President Donald Trump said in a press conference Tuesday evening that he would request Harvard return the nearly <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/15/harvard-coronavirus-cares-act/\">$9 million</a> it was granted as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.</span></p> <p><span>At the press conference, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said the aid money was not intended for \u201cbig public companies.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAnd not for Harvard,\u201d Trump added.</span></p> <p><span>Trump referenced the size of Harvard\u2019s endowment at the press conference. The endowment was valued at $40.9 billion dollars as of Spring 2019. <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/17/harvard-coronavirus-cfo-hollister-interview/\">Top administrators</a>, however, say it has likely shrunk as a result of the pandemic.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard\u2019s going to pay back the money,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd they shouldn\u2019t be taking it. So Harvard\u2019s going to. You have a number of \u2014 I\u2019m not going to mention any other names \u2014 but when I saw Harvard, they have one of the largest endowments anywhere in the country, maybe in the world, I guess, and they\u2019re going to pay back that money.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>It remains unclear by what mechanism, exactly, the University would return the funds. Indeed, Harvard may not have received the allocated money yet \u2014 as of Friday, the Department of Education had only provided $6 million in aid to colleges nationwide, according to Politico.</span></p> <p><span>The White House declined to comment further.</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday, after receiving backlash from several prominent Republican politicians, the University announced it would <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/21/harvard-stimulus-funds-financial-aid/\">dedicate 100 percent</a> of the $8.6 million it received from the CARES Act to student financial assistance.</span></p> <p><span>Though Mnuchin referenced businesses in his comments, funds for businesses and funds for higher education come from two separate parts of the CARES Act, which Trump signed into law on March 27.</span></p> <p><span>The funds allocated to Harvard stem from a $14 billion allocation to the Department of Education through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund. The funds for small businesses were allocated by the Small Business Administration through the Paycheck Protection Program, which had a separate $349 billion allocation.</span></p> <p><span>University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard has not applied for or received funds through the Paycheck Protection Program, which he said would have been inappropriate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard did not apply for, nor has it received any funds through the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses. Reports saying otherwise are inaccurate. President Trump is right that it would not have been appropriate for our institution to receive funds that were designated for struggling small businesses,\u201d Swain wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Swain reiterated that 100 percent of the CARES ACT funds will go to student financial assistance.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis financial assistance will be on top of the support the University has already provided to students \u2013 including assistance with travel, providing direct aid for living expenses to those with need, and supporting students\u2019 transition to online education,\" Swain wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Later in the press conference, another reporter asked Trump how confident he was that he\u2019d be able to \u201cclaw back\u201d funds from Harvard and others.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWell, look, I don\u2019t like when Harvard that has, I think, a $40 billion dollar endowment, or some incredible amount of money, that Harvard gets this money? Harvard should pay this money back. I want Harvard to pay that money back,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd if they won\u2019t do that, then we won\u2019t do something else. They have to pay it back. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Trump also suggested that the funds that Harvard is set to receive were intended for businesses, though they were not.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is meant for workers. This isn\u2019t meant for one of the richest institutions \u2014 not only, far beyond schools \u2014 in the world. They gotta pay it back.

{"title": "The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe's Crisis Within a Crisis | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When he received the phone call from the Bureau of Indian Affairs at 4 p.m. on Friday, March 27, Cedric D. Cromwell had been hoping for good news.</span></p> <p><span>Cromwell serves as president and chairman of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe. His term thus far has been trying: A week prior to the call, he declared a state of emergency for the Mashpee Wampanoag tribal nation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools were shut down, public buildings were closed, and he and the rest of the tribal council were scrambling to gather the resources their people would need to weather the crisis.</span></p> <p><span>That afternoon, Cromwell, the tribe\u2019s vice chair Jessie little doe Baird, and attorneys for the tribe gathered \u2014 separately \u2014 in their homes for a conference call with R. Glenn Melville, the deputy associate director at the U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Indian Affairs.</span></p> <p><span>Melville informed them that he had some \u201cbad news\u201d: The Department of the Interior was taking their land out of trust.</span></p> <p><span>The federal government bringing land in trust grants special protections and privileges to the land and the tribe that owns it. While in trust, land cannot be taken away from a tribe or sold to a non-Native without the approval of the federal government. It is not subject to state or local laws and taxes, because tribes are sovereign nations under U.S. law, and are therefore only subject to federal laws and regulations.</span></p> <p><span>Taking land out of trust means the tribe loses its sovereignty over that land \u2013 it becomes subject to state and local laws, and the state gains the right to tax the land and take it away if those taxes are not paid.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI said, \u2018Why are you doing this? What is this about?\u2019\u2019 Cromwell recalls. \u201cHe says, \u2018I\u2019ve been instructed by the Department of the Interior Secretary to take your land out of trust.\u2019\u2019\u2019 Cromwell and his attorneys repeatedly asked for more specifics. Melville gave the same response over and over again: that he was simply following instructions.</span></p> <p><span>Before the call, the tribal leaders felt fairly confident. \u201cWe actually thought we were the first tribe in the country to finish our paperwork and ask for disaster declaration and relief,\u201d Baird recalls. \u201cSo we thought the phone call was about our relief requests for COVID.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Cromwell says he, Baird, and their attorneys felt blindsided by the news. The U.S. has not taken land out of trust since the 1950s, and the consequences of doing so are devastating. The tribe will no longer have sovereign control over its land, and its government and social services will have to be dissolved in the midst of a pandemic. While the tribe will still technically own their 321 acres, they no longer have the trust protections that keep any of their land from being taken away.</span></p> <p><span>Just when Cromwell and Baird were gearing up to protect their community from COVID-19, they realized they would have to use much of their resources to protect their land as well.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI got off the phone; we huddled with the attorneys,\u201d Cromwell says. \u201cFour o\u2019clock on Friday, in the midst of a pandemic where the whole world is being impacted. And they take the time to call us, a trustee, and say, \u2018We're going to de-establish you \u2014 destroy you.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The decision to disestablish the land is based in a long history of complicated federal-tribal relations. Although the Mashpee have lived in the Cape Cod area since before the first European settlers arrived, the tribe has only been recognized at the federal level for 13 years. It has held 321 acres of land in trust for only five of those years, during which time it has operated as a fully sovereign nation, maintaining its own police department, housing development projects, and Wampanoag-language elementary school.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cLand in trust\u201d is a mechanism the U.S. government established to provide extra protections for tribal nations that had lost much of their land throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Robert T. Anderson, the director of the Native American Law Center at the University of Washington and the Oneida Indian Nation Visiting Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, describes the process of bringing land into trust: First, tribes must own the land as property owners; they can then ask the Secretary of the Interior to take the land into trust. Once that happens, the land cannot be sold or taken away involuntarily without the consent of the federal government.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s been a huge protection for tribes in the event that state or local taxes apply to the real estate and the tribe can\u2019t pay it for some reason,\u201d Anderson explains. \u201c[The state] wouldn\u2019t be able to take that property through any other mechanism without the consent of the federal government.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Federal recognition is required to hold land in trust. In 1934, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act, which was intended to decrease federal control over Native tribes and allow them to largely self-govern. The IRA affirmed Native nations\u2019 sovereign control over their lands, allowed them to purchase new land using federal loans, and authorized the Secretary of the Interior to accept additional tribal lands into trust and proclaim new reservations on those lands.</span></p> <p><span>The IRA also created a register of tribes that were deemed \u201cfederally recognized.\u201d Federal recognition means that tribes are recognized as having \u201ca government-to-government relationship\u201d with the United States, as well as \u201ccertain inherent rights of self-government\u201d like tribal sovereignty, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs website. They are also eligible for certain services and benefits.</span></p> <p><span>If a tribe was too small or had not made a treaty with the U.S. at any point, it was not eligible to be included in the IRA\u2019s list of benefits. There is a process through which tribes that are not on this register can gain federal recognition, but it is arduous and difficult. It requires tribes to have \u201cestablished that you have been an Indian tribe since historical times, that you maintain the continuous governmental body with ministers control over your members, and you have a defined territory \u2014 even though you may not own it anymore,\u201d Anderson explains.</span></p> <p><span>The Mashpee won federal recognition in 2007, which allowed the Secretary of the Interior to take their land into trust in 2015 and grant them a reservation.</span></p> <p><span>A recent lawsuit, however, reversed the Secretary\u2019s decision. The 24 plaintiffs of the suit \u2014 led by David and Michelle Littlefield \u2014 claim the Department was wrong to take the Mashpee\u2019s land into trust in the first place because the Mashpee did not fit the definition of \u201cIndian\u201d from the 2008 Supreme Court Case Carcieri v. Salazar.</span></p> <p><span>Before the 2008 case, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ken L. Salazar granted 31 acres of trust land to the Narragansett Tribe. Governor Donald L. Carcieri sued Salazar, claiming he did not have the authority to do so. Carcieri was concerned that the Narragansett would use the trust land to build a casino or another business that couldn\u2019t be taxed by the state of Rhode Island. The tribe, whose ancestors have lived in the Rhode Island area for more than 30,000 years, has about 2,400 enrolled members; they purchased the 31 acres in 1991 in order to build a housing complex for the elderly. At the tribe\u2019s request, the Department of the Interior took those 31 acres into trust in 1998.</span></p> <p><span>However, the Supreme Court ruled that the Department of the Interior had no authority to take land into trust for tribes recognized after the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act.</span></p> <p><span>Though the decision was a blow to the Narragansett Tribe, what was at stake was the 31 acre housing complex. Now, the 321 acres in question are the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe\u2019s entire land base. It is the last of the land that their ancestors inhabited for over 14,000 years, and they could very well lose it.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey should have spoken to us with the Darth Vader voice,\u201d Cromwell says. His voice drops an octave and he says, slowly with a dramatic flair, \u201c\u2018I'm taking your land away.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Cromwell is speaking to us from his kitchen, which he says has become an impromptu office now that the tribal buildings are closed. A television plays in the background for part of the call, and at one point, a young girl\u2019s voice interrupts. It\u2019s his granddaughter, and Cromwell asks us to hold on and gets off the phone to help her with something.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou got what you wanted? You got it? More? You sure? Okay, sweetheart.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The tribal government currently being run from Crowell\u2019s kitchen descends from the tribe that first greeted the pilgrims at Plymouth in 1621. The U.S. celebrates the Mashpee Wampanoag every November, with each Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, first Thanksgiving pageant, and carved turkey.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe were that tribe that sat down and first met [the Pilgrims], helped them through their first harsh winters, helped establish Plymouth with some of our land that was the anchor to building the United States of America,\u201d Cromwell says. \u201cAnd for this administration to say, \u2018You, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, you do not meet the definition of Indian tribe,\u2019 is just unprecedented, absurd.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Mashpee has a history with Harvard, too. The University\u2019s charter affirms its mission to educate the \u201cEnglish and Indian youth,\u201d because Harvard\u2019s Indian College, established in 1655, was home to four Native students. One of these students, Joel Iacoomes, was Mashpee \u2013 he was the College\u2019s first valedictorian but was unable to receive his diploma because he died in a shipwreck heading from the Cayman Islands to Cambridge. He was finally honored with his posthumous diploma at a ceremony in 2011.</span></p> <p><span>The Mashpee\u2019s interactions with settlers, however, were also part of the reason they were never federally recognized. As was the case for many tribes in the Northeast, so many Mashpee died as a result of war and disease brought by European colonists that their numbers were decimated. Today, they boast only 2,600 enrolled citizens.</span></p> <p><span>According to Baird, the Mashpee have been struggling for sovereignty for more than 300 years \u2014 since 1709, when they first sent a tribal citizen to file an agreement with the King of England. \u201cWe\u2019ve endured every manner of designation,\u201d Baird says. \u201cEverything from traditional village to Indian plantation, to praying town, to Indian district, to incorporated town, and have had citizenship actually forced upon us, had our land alienated from us, had overseers given to us, have overseers removed from us, and through all of that we've managed to maintain our territory.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Philip J. Deloria is a Professor of History at Harvard, whose research focuses on relations between American Indian peoples and the United States. He explains that there is a \u201ccommon perception\u201d that Natives in New England \u201cmore or less died or vanished. But the fact is, of course, that these people stayed, survived, persisted, resisted, found all kinds of ways to maintain cultural continuity.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Even though they survived and continued to thrive as a tribe, the Mashpee were not recognized in the 1934 IRA because their population was so low and because they had not made a treaty with the U.S. at any point. After decades of attempting to reclaim land, they were finally able to gain federal recognition in 2007 and moved forward to get reservation land put into trust \u2014 the Obama Administration deemed them eligible in 2015. In the five years since then, they have put significant amounts of infrastructure in place: housing, healthcare, a tribal court, and a school that teaches the Wampanoag language.</span></p> <p><span>All of this was at stake in the lawsuit led by the Littlefields.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis was illegal. If they took land into trust for this tribe, it would be illegal,\u201d says Michelle Littlefield in a 2018 WBSM TV interview. \u201cAnd we said from day one, \u2018If you do it, we\u2019re gonna challenge it.\u2019 And we did, and we won.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In January of 2016, the federal government placed land in Taunton, Mass. in the Mashpee\u2019s trust to be developed as a \u201ccommercial/industrial park\u201d that would include a \u201c400,000 ft. gaming complex,\u201d according to court documents. The next month, the Littlefields and 22 other plaintiffs took the Mashpee to court, claiming that the BIA had \u201cexceeded its statutory authority\u201d by putting the land in trust.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNone of us were happy with the location,\u201d Michelle said of the casino in the WBSM TV interview. \u201cIt was not fit for our community.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Michelle and David Littlefield have been fighting the Mashpee casino project since 2012. The First Light Casino would have been built down the street from their home, and many of the other 22 plaintiffs are their neighbors: lawyers, a realtor, a school secretary, a retired softball coach. The majority of the plaintiffs are married couples, and appear to be white and middle class. One woman, Veronica Casey, was on the Miss Taunton Scholarship Pageant Committee that judged the Littlefields\u2019 daughter, Lyndsey. Lyndsey won Miss Massachusetts and will soon move on to the Miss America pageant.</span></p> <p><span>But the stakes of the lawsuit were more complicated than a desire not to live down the street from a casino. In fact, one of the plaintiffs, Francis Lagace, filed a request with the Massachusetts Gaming Commission in 2013 to open Taunton\u2019s region of the state for commercial casino license applications because of \u201csubstantial delays associated with an Indian casino proposal.\u201d The lawsuit was partially funded by Neil Bluhm, a Chicago developer who had planned to build a casino in Brockton, 20 miles from the Mashpee casino. Others, it seems, wanted to build a casino of their own. And in a Boston Globe article from 2016, David Littlefield said it was not the casino that he and Michelle were worried about. Rather, it was the \u201cincredible arrogance\u201d of the federal government in creating \u201can Indian reservation in their backyard.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In an article from the Taunton Daily Gazette, Michelle said that she is primarily concerned with the Mashpee functioning as a sovereign nation, independent of state laws and regulations. She said that, as far as she is concerned, the land is no longer sovereign Mashpee Wampanoag Territory.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s back on the tax rolls and should now be under state and local control,\u201d she told the Gazette.</span></p> <p><span>The Littlefields did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p> <p><span>The federal government taking Mashpee Wampanoag tribal land out of trust will affect the tribe in innumerable ways. Mukayuhsak Weekuw \u2014 a Mashpee preschool specializing in W\u00f4pan\u00e2ak language instruction and a premier site of Indigenous language revitalization \u2014 might be shut down. The tribal court could lose its ability to hear criminal cases. The tribe\u2019s autonomous healthcare system could be adversely affected. Their freedom over economic development could be hindered: Without land in trust, the tribe loses the authority it had to implement its own tax codes and regulate businesses on its land.</span></p> <p><span>The tribe will also lose advantages that allowed it to provide affordable housing to its members. The Mashpee Wampanoag tribal land is situated half in the town of Mashpee and half in the town of Taunton; its borders lie in and around Cape Cod, an area known for its high tax rates. Before its land was taken out of trust, the tribe was considered a sovereign nation and was therefore exempt from state and local taxes, allowing it to provide its members with low income tax rates..</span></p> <p><span>Having the land in trust also allowed the tribe to provide housing to its members: Because the tribe had been considered sovereign, it was allowed to set its own zoning regulations instead of being required to adhere to those of Massachusetts, which meant that it could fit in more houses per acre.</span></p> <p><span>This enabled the creation of the Mashpee Wampanoag Village, a Low Income Housing Tax Credit Housing Project currently under construction in Mashpee. It has 42 units, with one house per half acre of land. The town of Mashpee\u2019s zoning regulations typically require that each house be built on a full acre of property. The tribe\u2019s sovereignty allowed the Mashpee Wampanoag to circumvent those regulations in order to make housing more available to its members. Now, that could all change.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf we don\u2019t match the zoning, and the permitting office doesn\u2019t provide the same zoning permits for the same zoning that the town of Mashpee has, we\u2019ve lost all that inventory right there,\u201d Cromwell explains. \u201cThat\u2019s $12 million worth of houses that goes up in flames because we don\u2019t meet the local zoning laws.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But Baird is especially concerned about the possibility that the tribal police could lose their jurisdiction over the land. Before the establishment of its own police force, Baird says that the tribe faced brutality at the hands of the local police.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI watched one man that lived next door to me being beaten severely for fishing on his Aboriginal rights by the Mashpee Police Department,\u201d Barid recalls. \u201cAnd the County police have also killed a tribal member, unarmed. Shot him to death.\u201d She fears what being brought back under the local police\u2019s jurisdiction might mean for her tribe.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI have a tremendous amount of respect for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe,\u201d writes Scott W. Carline, chief of the Mashpee Police Department, in an emailed statement. \u201cThis holds even more true today. Moving forward I pledge to the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe as well as all citizens, an open, accountable, accessible police department responsive to your needs and concerns,\u201d he continues. \u201cWe will continually strive to earn your trust, reduce crime, and provide exceptional services while always treating you with dignity and respect.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Still, Baird says that since the tribe\u2019s own police force has held jurisdiction, the Mashpee have not had issues with police brutality. The police force they have now is made up of tribal citizens, so they often have a good relationship with the people they are serving.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis would really undo a lot of incredibly powerful and positive work that Native people have done for the last 50, 60, 70, 80 years,\u201d Deloria says of the reservation disestablishment. \u201cThis is the untold story of the pandemic \u2014 all the bad shit that is still going on in terms of undoing things that have been really positive for Native people.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The ramifications of this legal decision could send ripples far beyond the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf they persist in this narrow interpretation of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, in terms of when the Department can take land in trust for tribes that are recognized, it could have an effect on about 35 tribes that are in a similar category to the Mashpee, having been recognized after 1934,\u201d Anderson explains. The decision to consider the Masphee\u2019s land ineligible for trust status would set a legal precedent to take land out of trust for other tribes across the country.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is an existential crisis for tribes,\u201d says Jean-Luc Pierite (Tunica-Biloxi), President of the Board of the North American Indian Center of Boston. \u201cWhat Chairman Cromwell alleges is that the federal government is doing this without a court order. If it can do this without a court order, then that signal is that our reservation lands are pretty much at the discretion of the Secretary of Interior. Any tribe that is recognized after 1934, let\u2019s say, is in danger of losing their tribal lands.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Pierite is currently researching the tribes that were federally recognized after 1934, and estimates that the number could near a hundred. If his estimation is correct, thousands of acres of Native land could be in peril.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey\u2019re trying to destroy us and erase us. And if they can do that, you know, now it\u2019s precedent,\u201d Cromwell says. \u201cIt\u2019s a template for them to go across America and say, \u2018Okay, one by one, one by one.\u2019 And then next thing you know, Indigenous people of this land will be erased.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As soon as Cromwell got off the Friday afternoon phone call, he convened a tribal council meeting. The council decided to seek both a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order on the U.S., protecting the tribe's land for the time being. During a virtual hearing with the Department of the Interior and the Department of Justice a few weeks ago, a judge approved the restraining order; a hearing is slated for mid-May.</span></p> <p><span>The Mashpee have also staked their hopes on a bill currently pending in Congress. In January 2019, Massachusetts Congressman Bill Keating introduced H.R. 312 \u2014 The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe Reaffirmation Act. If passed, the bill would reaffirm the Mashpee Wampanoag land as land in trust. Any actions relating to the land would be \u201cpromptly dismissed.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat bill passed in May of 2019 with overwhelming bipartisan support in the House of Representatives,\u201d Cromwell says. He predicts that it will not pass in the Senate, however.</span></p> <p><span>The Boston City Council has passed a resolution in support of Bill HR 312. When Kenzie Bok \u201911, the city councilor for District 8, first heard about the reservation\u2019s disestablishment, she and another counselor immediately met to co-write a resolution.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn the middle of this crisis, the Trump administration came down with a decision that they were going to take the land of the Mashpee Wampanoag out of trust, which really threatens to tribe\u2019s self governance and is a real slap in the face in the middle of this pandemic,\u201d Bok says. \u201cWe needed to put the city council on the record in support of the tribe.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The resolution followed a statement released by U.S. Senators Elizabeth A. Warren (D-Mass.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) that pledges to fight the reservation disestablishment. With about 6,000 Native people living in Boston, many of them Mashpee, the resolution was passed with support from a large majority of the City Council.</span></p> <p><span>The Mashpee have also received support from other Native American tribes. The National Congress of American Indians, which represents over five hundred tribes and has been an important voice in policy debates about Native issues since 1944, has reached out with statements of support. Individual tribes and Native interest organizations have shown support through letters and on social media, posting the hashtag #StandWithMashpee.</span></p> <p><span>The timeline of legal proceedings going forward is unclear. Besides the hearing in mid-May to address the tribe\u2019s preliminary injunction on the U.S., Cromwell doesn\u2019t know much beyond that. When we ask when all of these changes will take effect, he chuckles grimly and says, \u201cto destroy us? I don\u2019t have any dates on that at the time.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In the meantime, he hopes for more support from Americans to get the disestablishment decision reversed. \u201cWe really need America,\u201d Cromwell says. \u201cCall the senators, and stand with us, and flood the news lines, flood Congress with this and say, \u2018Stop it. Come on, stop, stop, stop.\u2019 It's cruel and painful. Help my people. Just help us.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><em>\u2014 Magazine writer Anna Kate E.

{"title": "Facing Backlash, Harvard Will Allocate 100 Percent of CARES Act Funds to Student Financial Assistance | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Ellen M. Burstein", "body": "<p><span>After receiving backlash for the <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/15/harvard-coronavirus-cares-act/\">nearly $9 million in funding</a> it netted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, Harvard will allocate the sum to student financial assistance.</span></p> <p><span>Numerous members of Congress \u2014 including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.), and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) \u2014 expressed outrage on Twitter that Harvard would be receiving federal assistance.</span></p> <p><span>All five members of Congress cited the size of the University\u2019s endowment in their tweets.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is ridiculous. Taxpayer relief funds should go to those in real need. Harvard University has a $41bn endowment\u2014the largest in the world. Put another way, Harvard\u2019s endowment is $13mm per student, or $171mm per faculty member,\u201d Cruz wrote on Sunday.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard\u2019s endowment \u2014 the largest of any University in the world \u2014 was last valued in June 2019 at $40.9 billion.</span></p> <p><span>However, top administrators have said its value has declined as a consequence of the pandemic. Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister cited an estimate placing the value of the endowment in the \u201cmid 30-billion range\u201d in <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/17/harvard-coronavirus-cfo-hollister-interview/\">an interview</a> with The Crimson last week.</span></p> <p><span>Cruz and Scott both voted for the CARES Act, which passed the Senate 96-0 on March 25. It passed the House by a voice vote and was signed into law by President Donald J. Trump on March 27.</span></p> <p><span>University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement Monday that Harvard will not be using any of the funds it is set to receive from the CARES Act to cover institutional costs.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBy federal formula laid out in the CARES Act, Harvard was allocated $8.6 million, with 50% of those funds to be reserved for grants to students,\u201d Newton wrote. \u201cHarvard is actually allocating 100% of the funds to financial assistance for students to meet their urgent needs in the face of this pandemic.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Newton wrote Harvard will distribute the funds \u201cbased on student financial need.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Department of Education used a formula laid out in the legislation to allocate the funds among thousands of American institutions of higher education. The formula took two factors into account: the proportion of students who receive federal Pell Grants, which was weighted 75 percent, and total graduate and undergraduate enrollment, which was weighted 25 percent.</span></p> <p><span>According to Newton, 16 percent of Harvard\u2019s 6,500 undergraduates are Pell Grant recipients, and 55 percent of students at the College receive some form of financial aid.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis financial assistance will be on top of the significant support the University has already provided to students \u2013 including assistance with travel, providing direct aid for living expenses to those with need, and supporting students\u2019 transition to online education,\u201d Newton wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Hawley wrote that Universities should have to spend down their endowments before they are given federal aid.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cUniversities with billions &amp; billions stashed away in endowments should get no taxpayer money until they have tapped those endowments,\u201d Hawley wrote on Twitter on Monday. Hawley added that it was \u201cobscene\u201d that Harvard will receive a \u201cbailout\u201d from the CARES Act.</span></p> <p><span>Yale University, which received nearly $7 million in aid, boasts a $30.3 billion endowment. Stanford University received around $7.4 million from the stimulus package and maintains a $27.7 billion endowment.</span></p> <p><span>Cruz called on Harvard to give its funding back to the federal government.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cDear Harvard: Thank you for my law degree and an excellent legal education. You\u2019re very rich; many people are hurting. Now give the money back,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Monday.</span></p> <p><span>Green and Scott, meanwhile, wrote that the funds should have been allocated to small businesses.</span></p> <p><span>The Small Business Administration announced on Thursday that the $349 billion earmarked in the CARES Act for its Paycheck Protection Program had been depleted. Legislators are working on a deal to allocate more funds to the program.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMillions have lost their job. Small businesses are suffering &amp; trying to stay alive. Meanwhile, Harvard, with its $40B endowment, just got $9M in taxpayer money,\u201d Scott wrote on Twitter.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat funding should have gone to small businesses, every cent of it,\u201d Green wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Some large businesses, such as Shake Shack, have returned federal aid money in response to similar criticisms that federal stimulus programs favored major corporations. Shake Shack gained the necessary funding to make up for its coronavirus losses through an equity transaction and returned its $10 million loan, per a statement posted to its website on Sunday.</span></p> <p><span>The funds Harvard received, however, came from a different section of the CARES Act than the funding for small businesses, and were allocated through the Department of Education, not the Small Business Administration.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWithin the $2 trillion CARES Act, Congress set aside $14 billion in the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund to address student needs, as well as impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on colleges and universities,\u201d Newton wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Some criticism of the funding came from within Harvard itself. Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, wrote on Twitter that Harvard \u201cdoesn\u2019t need\u201d the funds, also citing the size of its endowment.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis $9 million should goto small businesses and out of work people,\u201d Feigl-Ding wrote. \u201cC\u2019mon @Harvard , do the right thing &amp; donate it to the community. People are suffering!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>On April 7, Harvard announced it <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/7/harvard-donate-homeless-coronavirus/\">donated</a> $250,000 to the City of Cambridge to support a temporary homeless shelter.</span></p> <p><span>Donald J. Trump Jr. \u2014 son of President Donald J. Trump and Executive Vice President of Development and Acquisitions for The Trump Organization \u2014 also took to Twitter to criticize the allocation. He <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/4/Lieber-arrest-analysis/\">cited</a> the January arrest of former Chemistry department chair Charles M. Lieber on charges that he failed to disclose research funding from the Chinese government.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSo rather than going to a small business that actually needs the money, Harvard, with a $40 billion endowment and professors that keep getting arrested for giving research secrets to the Chinese Government takes $9,000,000 they don\u2019t need so a small business can\u2019t. What a joke!\u201d Trump Jr. wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Massie, a vocal critic of the CARES Act, also cited Lieber in his criticisms of Harvard\u2019s funding allocation, as well as the University\u2019s response to the COVID-19 crisis more broadly.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard has billions in their endowment, kicked students off campus this semester, harbored a researcher (chair of chemical biology department!) who, according to DOJ, failed to disclose payments from the Chinese govt,\u201d Massie wrote on Twitter. \u201cSo why did my colleagues include them in this bailout?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In a press conference Monday evening, a reporter asked Trump whether it was \u201cfair\u201d that corporations like Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House and Harvard \u201cgot a lot of money\u201d from the CARES Act. The reporter stated that the funding was intended for small businesses, but the funds Harvard received were from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWell I know one thing, I didn\u2019t get any, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get any.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSome people will have to return it, if we think it\u2019s inappropriate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf somebody got something that we think is inappropriate we will get it back.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Ellen M.

{"title": "As Coronavirus Spreads, False Theories Linking Harvard Professor Lieber to Disease\u2019s Origin Proliferate Online | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "James S. Bikales", "body": "<p><span>As the novel coronavirus spreads, conspiracy theories about its origin have spread with it \u2014 including those falsely alleging that the virus was made and sold by Harvard Chemistry professor Charles M. Lieber.</span></p> <p><span>Posts falsely claiming that Lieber was arrested for creating and selling the novel coronavirus have been shared more than 79,000 times on Facebook as of April 7, according to Reuters. Thousands of posts on Twitter and several YouTube videos have made similarly baseless claims connecting Lieber with the creation of the virus.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, Lieber was arrested in January for <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/1/29/lieber-federal-charges/\">allegedly concealing Chinese funding and lying to federal agents</a>. While he reportedly participated in Chinese government research programs in Wuhan \u2014 the same city where the novel coronavirus originated \u2014 there is no evidence to suggest that Lieber, a nanoscientist, engineered a biological agent, nor did the federal government press charges against him related to the coronavirus.</span></p> <p><span>Lieber, who is currently on paid administrative leave, did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p> <p><span>A growing body of scientific evidence suggests the novel coronavirus originated in nature, without data to the contrary.</span></p> <p><span>A coalition of over 25 public health scientists and medical professionals signed a letter in the medical journal The Lancet to \u201cstrongly condemn\u201d theories suggesting the virus was artificially constructed.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cScientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife,\u201d they wrote. \u201cConspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Scripps Research \u2014 a renowned American medical research facility \u2014 wrote in a press release that analyses of the virus\u2019s genome show it evolved in nature. The release cited evidence showing the backbone of the novel coronavirus does not mirror those of any known coronaviruses, but rather those of viruses found in bats and pangolins.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf someone were seeking to engineer a new coronavirus as a pathogen, they would have constructed it from the backbone of a virus known to cause illness,\u201d the press release notes.</span></p> <p><span>Another study published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature found that the virus\u2019s genome is 96 percent identical to a bat coronavirus, concluding the novel coronavirus likely originated in bats.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the scientific consensus, conspiracy theories regarding the virus\u2019s origin have continued to proliferate online.</span></p> <p><span>Experts said a variety of factors may have contributed to the popularity of these rumors: small kernels of truth, the uncertainty and fear created by the pandemic, and the peddling of the similar theories by political and media elites.</span></p> <p><span>Fenwick McKelvey, an associate professor of communication studies at Concordia University in Canada, said coincidences like Lieber\u2019s connection to Wuhan can raise people\u2019s suspicions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn many ways you can think of a conspiracy theory as something that\u2019s attractive and desirable because it\u2019s offering a coherent explanation of the world and giving you meaning where there is none,\u201d McKelvey said. \u201cFinding these links could be helpful and allow people to manage at a time of great stress and uncertainty.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Brian Levin \u2014 a professor of criminal justice at California State University, San Bernardino and director of the university\u2019s Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism \u2014 said the unsettling nature of the pandemic lends itself to conspiracy.</span></p> <p><span><br>\r\n\u201cWhenever you see a catalytic event, you\u2019ll see an array of unusual theories and sometimes extremism or propaganda around it too,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Levin added that while some people promote conspiracy theories to find a scapegoat or out of bigotry, others simply believe they are true without malintent.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWith this, there were enough kernels of truth that the lies between the gaps seem not as wide on the Internet as they do in reality,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Lawrence Rosenthal, chair of the Berkeley Center for Right-Wing Studies, also said conspiracy theories are often attempts to find someone to blame for complex situations.</span></p> <p><span>He added that such theories are an attempt to use stories, rather than facts, to understand an emotional situation.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is a wholly different way of going about explaining things, or coming to terms with things, than trying to use empirical facts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s closer at once to an explanation and a vehicle to express emotion.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Joshua Hart, an associate professor of psychology at Union College who has studied what leads people to believe in conspiracy theories, said President Donald Trump\u2019s dislike of China has fueled the theory by making it a partisan matter.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe allure of a conspiracy theory is that it points to a kind of tractable source or culprit for the problem so that you can wrap your head around the idea of identifying the perpetrators and stopping them,\u201d Hart said.</span></p> <p><span>Hart cited a sense of powerlessness Americans felt after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. After the attacks, he said the false suggestion that they may have been an \u201cinside job\u201d was comforting to some because it meant Americans could \u201cpolice ourselves,\u201d while what happened in terrorist training camps abroad could not be controlled.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to the anxiety created by the pandemic, the buy-in of some prominent political and media personalities has elevated these theories, according to University of Miami Associate Professor of Political Science Joseph E. Uscinski, who specializes in the study of conspiracy theories.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEvery pandemic winds up with conspiracy theories, whether it was the Ebola outbreak of six years ago or SARS or AIDS, there\u2019s conspiracy theories about pretty much everything,\u201d Uscinski said. \u201cBut because of how big and acute this one is, combined with the fact that many of our political and media elites are trafficking in these theories has made them a little more popular than some previous similar theories have been.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Uscinski cited a claim made by U.S. Senator Thomas B. \u201cTom\u201d Cotton \u201999 (R-Ark.) on FOX News in February that the virus could have been manufactured in a Wuhan lab, as well as claims by Trump and radio host Rush H. Limbaugh that the effects of the virus are being exaggerated.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen we poll on this, we find that Republicans are more likely to believe in some of these theories than Democrats, and it\u2019s likely because Republican leaders and conservative media personalities are pushing these theories,\u201d Uscinski said.</span></p> <p><span>Uscinski added that although many modern conspiracy theories \u2014 including those connecting Lieber to the virus \u2014 do spread through social media, his research has not found evidence that more people believe in theories today than before the internet.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn this country\u2019s history, you didn\u2019t need an internet for, you know, witch trials and red scares and Freemason freak-outs and Illuminati scares,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need the new communication technologies for these things to spread on their own.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer James S.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As the world settled into the largest shutdown in modern history, a strange side effect emerged: The skies began to clear.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOne of the results of the shutdown has been a great improvement in air quality. And anybody can see this with regard to visibility,\u201d explains Dr. Daniel Jacob, professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Environmental Engineering at Harvard. Satellites and measurement stations, he says, have observed large drops in nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter pollution across the world.</span></p> <p><span>And indeed, the skies have cleared \u2014 many in the Indian state of Punjab now report that they can see the Himalayas, over 100 miles away, for the first time in decades. As factories close, highways empty, and billions remain trapped at home, emissions have dropped sharply. One estimate from Carbon Brief shows a 25 percent reduction in carbon emissions compared to the same period last year, though Jacob notes that recent measurements show China is already returning to higher levels of pollution \u201cAs soon as the economy recovers, it will be back to normal with regards to air pollution.,\u201d he says. \u201cI have no doubt about this.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>These reductions in air pollution, for as long as they last, may reveal large-scale benefits to breathing cleaner air. \u201cYou can also do some calculations about the impact of mortality associated with air pollution, and you find considerable gains in that regard,\u201d Jacob explains. And already, some have made these calculations \u2014 one conservative model from Dr. Marshall Burke, an assistant professor at Stanford, projects a two-month reduction in mortality of over 50,000 deaths in China alone.</span></p> <p><span>However, Burke clarifies in the analysis that these don\u2019t support any idea that pandemics are good for health, but instead merely represent one specific metric: the health benefits from the changes in air pollution caused by economic shutdowns.</span></p> <p><span>When you zoom out, the interaction between the coronavirus pandemic and climate change is complicated and often reveals a dismal picture. New evidence suggests long-term exposure to air pollution may have made the disease more lethal, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities, while fossil fuel companies have attempted to leverage this moment to their advantage.</span></p> <p><span>Previous research has already demonstrated that long-term air pollution exposure increases mortality risk, and now COVID-19 is proving to be an immediate example of its deadly effects. A recent study from the T.H. Chan School of Public Health analyzed data from approximately 3,000 counties in the United States and found that a rise in fine particulate matter of merely one microgram per cubic meter was associated with a 15 percent increase in the mortality rate of COVID-19.</span></p> <p><span>These results, though still preliminary, are immediately relevant to environmental regulations and epidemic modeling, but many questions remain unanswered. The continued assessment of new data and potential additional confounding variables, as well as analysis at smaller spatial densities, all needed to confirm these results. The data and methods from the study have been made publically available under an open science framework, so students or other interested individuals can access and analyze the data themselves, and so other countries can replicate similar analyses.</span></p> <p><span>For years, researchers have warned us that climate change exacerbates existing inequalities. Now, through a bleak display of transitive logic, the coronavirus pandemic is doing the same.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. Francesca Dominici, professor of Biostatistics, Population, and Data Science at the Chan School, pointed out early reports which have shown a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths among people of color \u2014 in Louisiana, for instance, black people account for 70 percent of coronavirus fatalities yet make up only 32 percent of the population. In Wisconsin, the same is true: Black people represent 42 percent of the deaths from coronavirus and only 6 percent of the population.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. Aaron Bernstein, director of the Center for Climate, Health, and Global Environment at the Chan School, notes that while research hasn\u2019t yet shown air pollution to be a driving force behind these inequities in mortality, it is possible. Exploring this connection will require further research, but as Bernstein points out, \u201cwe already had ample reason to continue to improve air pollution, which we know aside from COVID-19, harms the poor and people of color in this country more than everybody else.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>To battle the virus, we\u2019ve seen multi-trillion-dollar expenditures, daily white house press briefings, and massive sacrifices made by every individual. In response to climate change, progress has been slow and insufficient.</span></p> <p><span>But the two crises aren\u2019t so far apart \u2014 our response to both COVID-19 and climate change will determine whether people get sick or not and whether they live or not. This pandemic may even carry lessons regarding what it takes to mobilize defensive action. As Bernstein explains, \u201cWe can prevent harm by changing what we do when it comes to fossil fuels and how we provide energy to our lives, in a way that is in parallel to what is going on with COVID-19 and to make it much more personal and much more actionable.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But fossil fuel companies, some claim, are attempting to seize the moment to sway public opinion and lobby for environmental protection rollbacks. Dr. Geoffrey Supran, research fellow in the Department of the History of Science, writes in an emailed statement, \u201cThe fossil fuel industry and its political allies are systematically exploiting coronavirus chaos to protect its profits and lock society into climate chaos.\u201d He explains that as the coronavirus situation has worsened, there\u2019s been an uptick in industry messaging as well as political lobbying from the fossil fuel industry. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now are the familiar one-two punch public affairs tactics that Big Oil has perfected over the past century.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>TC Energy, the company building the Keystone Pipeline, has insisted on proceeding with the project in the midst of the crisis, claiming it will \u201cstrengthen the continent\u2019s energy security,\u201d while Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, an environmental advocacy group, suggests in the New Yorker, \u201cthat\u2019s obvious nonsense \u2014 at the moment, a record glut of oil is so overwhelming the market that there\u2019s literally no place left to store it.\u201d Meanwhile, Amy Westervelt, a reporter at Drilled News, claims to have tracked more than three dozen ways the fossil fuel industry and its allies in the Trump administration may have exploited the pandemic to roll back federal, state, and local regulations.</span></p> <p><span>Supran suggests out Harvard may not be a neutral player in this game: \u201cAs students and faculty have been pointing out for seven years, by continuing to refuse to divest from fossil fuels, Harvard is legitimizing the politics of Big Oil\u2026 The fossil fuel industry\u2019s lobbying and propaganda campaigns to delay climate action and exploit the coronavirus crisis are, in Harvard\u2019s eyes, legitimate tactics worthy of our investments.\u201d Jason Newton, a spokesperson for Harvard, declined to comment on these claims.</span></p> <p><span>In response to a recent NY Times op-ed in which the presidents of Harvard, MIT, and Stanford defended their decision to \u201ctak[e] difficult steps now, for the public good,\u201d Supran writes that institutions like Harvard have \u201cbeen ahead of the curve in confronting this crisis. If only they could bring the same logic and leadership to our collapsing climate too.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><em>\u2014 Magazine writer Tyler T.

The spring 2020 poll results were released Thursday.</span></p> <p><span>The poll, which surveyed more than 2,500 Americans between the ages of 18 and 29, found that Biden leads Trump 51 percent to 28 percent among all of its respondents \u2014 and his lead is even wider among respondents who said they are \u201clikely voters.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Just 32 percent of those surveyed said they approve of Trump\u2019s job performance.</span></p> <p><span>The survey found that Biden\u2019s lead over Trump among surveyed youths is similar to that which U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who dropped out of the Democratic presidential primary earlier this month, would have held in a hypothetical general election matchup.</span></p> <p><span>On a press call Thursday, Della Volpe said that one of the key questions of the poll was \u201cWhat would the Bernie factor be heading into the general election?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe found, actually, that the Bernie factor isn\u2019t really a factor,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Fifty-four percent of respondents said they will \u201cdefinitely\u201d vote in the upcoming presidential election. Sixty-nine percent of surveyed Democrats and 64 percent of surveyed Republicans said they will \u201cdefinitely\u201d vote in November; only 31 percent of surveyed independent and unaffiliated voters said they would turn out.</span></p> <p><span>Just 8 percent of respondents said they believed the government is \u201cworking as it should be.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe actually found the overall sentiment unsurprising given our personal experiences interacting with our friends and classmates,\u201d Justin Y. Tseng \u201922, a member of the Public Opinion Project, said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a general anxiety that government isn\u2019t addressing our problems, such as our worries when it comes to healthcare and debt.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The coronavirus pandemic and healthcare were rated as the two most important issues among respondents. Forty-five percent of respondents said they are concerned about access to healthcare and mental health services, and 43 percent said they are concerned that someone they know will die from COVID-19.</span></p> <p><span>Concern over healthcare has increased twofold, from 8 percent to 17 percent, since the IOP\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/11/19/iop-youth-poll-impeachment/\">fall 2019 youth poll</a>.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOur sense is that concern over healthcare has really been there all along, but coronavirus has really laid bare the inequities and problems in access to the healthcare system in such a way that it\u2019s really made it salient to the minds of young voters,\u201d IOP Public Opinion Project Chair K. \u201cCathy\u201d Sun \u201922 said. \u201cI think the ongoing pandemic will really only exacerbate a lot of these problems that young people are already experiencing \u2014 particularly more young people of color.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Youth Poll also examined the varying degrees to which black and white Americans trust public institutions and found the greatest disparity within trust in the police. The survey found that 28 percent of black respondents said they trusted the police, compared to 59 percent of white respondents. It also found that white respondents were largely more trustful of public institutions to \u201cdo the right thing all or most of the time.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Eighty-five percent of respondents agreed that the government needs to take some measures to alleviate student loan debt. Sixty-three percent of survey respondents expressed concern over the impact of housing costs on their future.</span></p> <p><span>Della Volpe said although young people often expressed fear over matters such as healthcare and family stability at focus groups, he is \u201chopeful\u201d there will be a large youth turnout in the 2020 election.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cRather than turning away, I think they\u2019re leaning in toward voting in the general election and giving some voice to those anxieties through the ballot box,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw that in \u201918. I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll see that in this cycle as well.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Jasper G.

{"title": "Hear the Bern: The Long Road to Reconciliation | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "The Crimson Editorial Board", "body": "<p><span>Soon after Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced that he will drop from the 2020 Democratic primary race, he endorsed the newly minted presumptive Democratic nominee \u2014 former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Since the race has narrowed, Harvard political groups have been publicly divided on whether to support Biden\u2019s candidacy. One group, Harvard College Students for Bernie, took to Twitter to publicly announce that the group <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/17/harvard-for-bernie-rejects-biden/\">will not endorse</a> the former Vice President.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard for Bernie has established itself as a durable organizing body, with considerable life outside of the confines of the 2020 election. Its activities have extended to organizing panels on the future of socialism post-Bernie and launching a \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Harvard4Bernie/status/1250453863469121536\">pressure campaign</a>\u201d under the Harvard for Bernie moniker to pressure Harvard into providing its workers with adequate paid sick leave, hazard pay, and personal protective equipment, or PPE. Additionally, Harvard for Bernie has remained remarkably steadfast in its stance despite severe criticism. In the aftermath of their decision, the group faced opponents such as Harvard College Students for Biden who suggested that the lack of an endorsement is akin to \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/harvardforbiden/status/1249184141763108864?s=20\">sidelining this election</a>\u201d and \u201ca vote for Trump.\u201d Rather than back down after receiving this criticism, Harvard for Bernie pinned the tweet \u2014 an example of the staunch, nonconforming, and likely enduring politics Bernie\u2019s progressive ideas have animated in many of his supporters.</span></p> <p><span>What we find most interesting about this exchange \u2014 rising above the circumstances of any specific Twitter beef or even the philosophical and tactical debate around when to coalesce around a given candidate \u2014 is the lesson that the unwillingness of these organizers to endorse Biden should teach establishment, center-left groups, both on campus and nationwide. The profound level of disaffection the progressive left feels with politics as usual and their dedication to changing this paradigm will not disappear overnight.</span></p> <p><span>That disaffection came through in the Democratic primary, but it has shown itself a powerful force behind expressions of discontent closer to home, as embodied in the activist spirit of the <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/11/24/protesters-interrupt-the-game/\">Harvard-Yale</a> divestment protests.</span></p> <p><span>Come November, many supporters of Sanders uncertain now may ultimately end up voting (perhaps begrudgingly) for Biden. But, as Harvard for Bernie\u2019s refusal to endorse Biden illustrates, their support is not a given. Constructive dialogue between these two factions of the Democratic Party \u2014 the center-left and the progressive left \u2014 must occur between now and the general election if the two groups are to be reconciled.</span></p> <p><span>Maintaining any expectation that progressives will by default fall in line, given evidence that this is just not the case, will only prove disastrous for the Democratic Party. A conversation about the soul of the party awaits, and failure to engage with the Harvard for Bernies of the political landscape seems doomed to perpetuate existing divisions.</span></p> <p><span>Even beyond the campaign trail, recognition of the progressive left\u2019s lasting appetite for activism and contestation has implications for political dialogue on campus, too, once we return. Though our time sharing a physical space has been interrupted, activist fervor in our community \u2014 from seeking <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/22/harvard-coronavirus-hgsu-uaw-concerns/\">better</a> working <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/21/students-launch-campaign-for-workers/\">conditions</a> to fossil fuel <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/23/divest-harvard-virtual-earth-day-rally/\">divestment</a> \u2014 remains undimmed.</span></p> <p><span>Just as it may on the national political scene, failure to seek reconciliation, engagement, and genuine compromise with activist and progressive forces may leave lasting divisions, with lasting consequences.</span></p> <p><span><em>This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board.

{"title": "The End of the Harvard Century | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Teng Biao, who has cropped black hair and rectangular, wire-framed glasses, was preparing to drive to Logan International Airport on March 10, 2015, when he received a phone call from a \u201cpowerful person\u201d at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Teng was then a visiting fellow at Harvard Law School. A Chinese dissident and human rights lawyer, he has criticized the Chinese Communist Party for human rights violations since the early 2000s.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBecause of my work, I was disbarred and put on a ban from teaching, and eventually fired from [China University of Political Science and Law] University,\u201d Teng says. \u201cI was put under house arrest from time to time, and disappeared a few times \u2014 kidnapped by Chinese secret police, and detained and tortured.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In February 2011, Teng and several other human rights advocates met in Beijing to discuss the arrest of another dissident, Chen Guangcheng. Teng \u201cdisappeared\u201d three days later; the Chinese government released him in April after U.S. officials voiced concerns about Teng\u2019s detention.</span></p> <p><span>In 2013, Teng secured a position at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. But as China began arresting members of the New Citizens\u2019 Movement \u2014 an activist network which Teng helped create \u2014 Teng realized he was in physical danger and would be detained again if he returned to the mainland.</span></p> <p><span>That year, Human Rights Watch recommended Teng to the Scholars at Risk program, which provided him funding and an offer to be a visiting scholar at the Harvard Law School. He accepted, arriving in September.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI am grateful that Harvard [could] host me for a year,\u201d Teng says. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, because I\u2019m a dissident very, very critical of the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Early in 2015, Teng and Chen Guangcheng, who had by then been released from Chinese custody, had planned to cross paths again. Working with Harvard graduates, Teng had scheduled an event to be hosted at Harvard in late March or early April, during which he and Chen would speak about their experiences as dissidents.</span></p> <p><span>But on Feb. 11, the powerful person at Harvard gave Teng the first call.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe told me to cancel the talk,\u201d Teng says. \u201cHe told me the time we were supposed to give our talk, that day was when the Harvard president would fly back from Beijing. And a few weeks before that, the Harvard president was meeting Xi Jinping.\u201d The administrator told him hosting an event with two Chinese dissidents only days after a historic meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and then University President Drew G. Faust would \u201cembarrass\u201d Harvard, Teng recalls.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was not about the title or the topics \u2014 but because of ourselves,\u201d Teng says. \u201cWe ourselves are sensitive.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Teng and the other organizers persisted, hoping they could find another Harvard venue. \u201cWe tried to avoid him, but eventually we realized we were not able to,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>The second phone call, on March 10, was a formal and final warning. The powerful person called Teng to his office and told him the event would embarrass the University and potentially threaten the continuation of collaborative programs and joint research with China. The administrator asked Teng to \u201cpostpone\u201d the event, and Teng finally agreed.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPostpone is a polite word,\u201d Teng recalls. \u201cThey never invited us to give a talk after that.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Chen Guangcheng puts it more bluntly. \u201cWhat he meant was that it was going to be postponed <em>indefinitely</em>,\u201d he explains, through an interpreter. \u201cIt was just another way to cancel it completely.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>That powerful person also made Teng promise to keep the cancellation a secret, and at the time Teng told almost nobody. Chen was particularly struck by this self-censorship. \u201cIt seemed really strange to me at the time, because this is not what Teng Biao is like when he\u2019s back in China,\u201d Chen says. \u201cHe\u2019s very outspoken.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Though Teng has since then told journalists about the incident, he has refused to reveal the powerful person\u2019s identity and again declined to identify him to me, citing fears of potential employment retaliation.</span></p> <p><span>However, sources familiar with the incident speaking under the condition of anonymity confirmed that that person was Professor William P. Alford, Harvard Law School\u2019s Vice Dean for International Legal Studies. Throughout his career, Alford has met with current and past presidents of China and Taiwan and spoken at the Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHaving for years served on the Scholars at Risk Committee and for decades hosted a broad range of scholars and law related activists from China at HLS, I tried to make Dr. Teng\u2019s time here academically fruitful,\u201d Alford wrote in an emailed statement. \u201cI invited him to speak in my class around the time in question, introduced him to colleagues and met with him frequently about his research, his plans, and his family. I did ask that he schedule the event in question after our University President had left Beijing.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In those first few months of 2015, Harvard\u2019s international presence and collaboration efforts came into conflict with its stated commitment to academic freedom. In this seemingly isolated clash, the former won \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t seem to generally be the case.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard has for years maintained a unique and symbiotic relationship with China, born out of a thick network of decades-old, grassroots connections. From its inception, the relationship has been inherently political, but Harvard has not refrained from criticizing the Chinese Communist Party. During his visit to Beijing last March, for instance, University President Lawrence S. Bacow read a Uighur poem in defense of academic freedom in his speech at Peking University; the same day, he had an audience with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</span></p> <p><span>Though the Harvard-China relationship always entailed mutual benefit, it was for decades asymmetrical \u2014 China needed Harvard more than Harvard needed China, which perhaps gave the University more leeway to be critical of the Chinese government.</span></p> <p><span>But over the past decade, China\u2019s global influence has grown dramatically. In 2010, China became the world\u2019s second-largest economy; in 2018, it surpassed the U.S. in terms of scientific papers published. Escalating tensions have accompanied this shift in global power, threatening to compromise Harvard and China\u2019s special relationship: Xi has cracked down on dissent both within and outside of China\u2019s borders, and the FBI has launched numerous investigations into alleged Chinese industrial and academic \u201cespionage,\u201d including one into undisclosed Chinese funding sent to the University\u2019s former Chemistry Department Chair, Charles M. Lieber. As the geopolitical and academic balance shifts in China\u2019s favor, the Teng Biao incident may indicate that, at least in some instances, Harvard depends on China more than the other way around.</span></p> <p><span>Mark C. Elliott, Harvard\u2019s Vice Provost for International Affairs, acknowledges that Harvard\u2019s simultaneous engagement with and criticism of the CCP may seem like a paradox to some observers. But, he says, Harvard is not political, nor is it a government \u2014 it is a university. This position allows it to provide an open forum for clashing perspectives while still earning the respect of some of the subjects of its criticisms, like Xi.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[Harvard] does not take a political position on anything. It takes positions on matters relating to academic freedom,\u201d Elliott says. \u201cI sometimes jokingly tell people, \u2018Our foreign policy is Veritas.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The cancellation of Teng\u2019s event, however, revealed that the University isn\u2019t immune from the CCP\u2019s reach. It also served as a reminder that Harvard\u2019s relationship with China doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum. Even if higher education at times provides an alternative space for international dialogue and informal critique, the University cannot categorically evade the conflicting interests of state and academia, of politics and truth.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard first hired a Chinese language professor in 1879 and by 1936 had graduated more than 1,000 Chinese international students. But most of the University\u2019s present-day engagement with China traces back only a few decades. Following China\u2019s Communist Revolution, CCP policies banning most foreign academics had nearly severed the relationship. Only after Deng Xiaoping\u2019s 1978 reforms did Chinese universities reopen their doors to western academics, and Harvard was among the first to enter, embarking on a decades-long road of modernizing Chinese universities, training China\u2019s top academics, and shaping Chinese policy.</span></p> <p><span>In 1978, School of Public Health Professor William C. Hsiao traveled to China to visit family. Howard H. Hiatt, then Dean of the School of Public Health, was interested in establishing an institution-to-institution relationship with China, and he asked Hsiao to explore any possibilities.</span></p> <p><span>While in Beijing, Hsiao visited China\u2019s Ministry of Health, which at the time had only a few dozen employees. \u201cRight away I was taken to the minister\u2019s office,\u201d Hsiao recalls, where he expressed Hiatt\u2019s interest.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOf course the minister knew Harvard\u2019s name,\u201d Hsiao says. \u201cHe said, \u2018This is a wonderful idea.\u2019\u201d The Ministry of Health seized the opportunity, connecting Harvard with Shanghai First Medical University and initiating joint research projects and a series of faculty exchanges. This in turn sparked further collaboration, creating a dense and self-perpetuating network.</span></p> <p><span>The project survives today as the Harvard China Health Partnership, the first institution-to-institution relationship between an American university and a Chinese one.</span></p> <p><span>Though the HCHP is an institutional effort, it was rooted in individual relationships, a trend that continued as other Harvard professors began conducting research in mainland China. Ezra F. Vogel, who directed the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies from 1972 to 1977, was able to study in China for the first time in 1980. Arthur M. Kleinman, a Harvard physician and anthropologist, transferred his work from Taiwan to mainland China in 1978 and introduced the modern notion of clinical depression to the mainland in 1980.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMost of our collaborations [with China] are from the bottom up,\u201d says Professor William C. Kirby, a former director of the Fairbank Center and the current chair of the Harvard China Fund. A Harvard professor and a Tsinghua professor might share mutual research interests and begin working together; a Harvard professor\u2019s Chinese postdoctoral students might help their advisor connect with other Chinese academics.</span></p> <p><span>In 1979, Shanghai First Medical University sent four of their top academics to Harvard. Two would train in molecular biology, one would learn health policy, and the last would study oncology \u2014 disciplines, Hsiao says, that were almost non-existent in China at the time. Each of these first four professors went on to become high-ranking university administrators, developing their respective fields in China. Only one Harvard faculty member went to Shanghai in that initial exchange.</span></p> <p><span>In the 1980s and 1990s, Harvard professors were often helping China build capacity and training Chinese faculty, in disciplines ranging from public health policy, to environmental science, to psychiatry. Hsiao began teaching Chinese scholars from basics: how to design a survey, how to administer a hospital. \u201cWe trained the first generation of Chinese faculty members in health policy and management,\u201d Hsiao says. \u201cThen we trained the second generation.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>That capacity building extended from university departments to government policy. Not even a decade after his first meeting with leaders of China\u2019s Ministry of Health, Hsiao found himself at lunch with the ministry\u2019s new head, a clinician named Chen Minzhang, in 1987.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe really hit it off,\u201d Hsiao recalls. The new Minister of Health appreciated Hsiao\u2019s unvarnished honesty in enumerating problems with China\u2019s public health system. \u201cUnder an authoritarian regime, people do not want to usually tell you the bad news,\u201d Hsiao says. \u201cThey only want to praise what you\u2019re doing well. As a person from another country, I thought I could tell the Chinese the truth.\u201d Universities have historically provided such alternative spaces for honest discussions within regimes hostile to criticism \u2014 what Kirby characterizes as a sort of \u201cintellectual safety valve.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As the lunch ended, Hsiao recalls Chen telling him, \u201cProfessor Hsiao, I do not know, \u2018What is policy?\u2019 I\u2019m a clinician, I know how to treat patients.\u201d Following that meeting, the School of Public Health launched its first executive education programs for officials in China\u2019s Ministry of Health, as well as the heads of health in each of China\u2019s 31 provinces, helping lay the groundwork for modern Chinese health policy.</span></p> <p><span>The asymmetry of Harvard-China exchanges in the later decades of the 20th century tipped far in the University\u2019s favor \u2014 the development of Chinese universities and government bodies depended on Harvard\u2019s knowledge and expertise. Harvard, in turn, did not lack incentives to engage its Chinese counterparts.</span></p> <p><span>In part because of China\u2019s dependence on the University, Harvard and its scholars gained greater access to the largest potential pool of academic talent in the world; to data on pressing issues, from an enormous population living in an up-and-coming economic superpower; to the world\u2019s longest continuous historical archive. Perhaps most importantly, Harvard rekindled a relationship largely cut off by the Communist Revolution, establishing a trust and rapport with China that only select American universities enjoy today.</span></p> <p><span>For six days in the fall of 1997, for the first time in over a decade, the Chinese head of state \u2014 then President Jiang Zemin \u2014 paid a state visit to the U.S. During his trip, Jiang met with America\u2019s political, economic, and academic leadership: he spoke with President Bill Clinton, toured IBM and Bell Labs, and visited Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>In the late 1990s, many Americans vividly remembered the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre and wanted little to do with China. Vogel, then director of the Fairbank Center, thought the political circumstances meant there should be as much communication with China as possible.</span></p> <p><span>He and another professor, Ning Wang, began looking for ways to increase contact. Through Wang\u2019s connections, they learned that Jiang was planning a trip to the U.S. When he was a younger official, Jiang had been on a delegation that passed through Harvard, and \u201che himself wanted to come [again],\u201d Vogel says.</span></p> <p><span>On Nov. 1, Jiang spoke before a packed Sanders Theater, with another 4,000 people lining the streets. In his speech, Jiang lauded recent Chinese reforms and emphasized that China needed to continue learning from America, especially praising Harvard\u2019s historic relationship with China: \u201cThe Chinese educational, scientific and cultural communities have all along maintained academic exchanges with this university,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Jiang\u2019s speech emphasized the importance of academic and international collaboration to China\u2019s development. But the massive protests surrounding the theater, decrying the \u201cThree Terrible T\u2019s\u201d of Taiwan, Tibet, and Tiananmen, showed the political controversy inevitably associated with the People\u2019s Republic of China, a nation the west had condemned for decades.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard, however, had no intention of providing Jiang with a soapbox: The University forced China\u2019s president to answer 15 minutes of unrehearsed questions. \u201cThat way it would not be just a session where we\u2019re allowing the Chinese to express their views,\u201d Vogel recalls.</span></p> <p><span>Jiang ended his speech by extending an invitation to President Neil L. Rudenstine to visit China, and the two men met in Beijing the following March. In his own speech at Peking University, Rudenstine said, \u201cUniversities can work to create \u2018neutral spaces\u2019 for serious discussion, based on a shared commitment to free inquiry, to rigorous research and analysis, and to open dialogue\u201d \u2014 at a time when the international community was condemning China, Rudenstine proposed Harvard as a safety valve that could allow for dialogue to continue.</span></p> <p><span>The following year, Rudenstine organized a meeting between leaders of top Chinese and American universities, where attendees discussed basic principles for further international collaboration among institutions of higher education.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe leaders of Chinese universities, the people with whom we interact by and large, much more broadly share our values than not,\u201d says Kirby, who helped organize the meeting. \u201cThere is a long history of association between Chinese universities and American universities before 1949, before the Communist Revolution. Part of this [meeting] was to re-establish those kinds of things.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Today, scholars from across Harvard\u2019s schools and disciplines want to study in China or work with Chinese universities. According to Kleinman, who directed the Harvard University Asia Center for eight years, over the past 50 years, collaboration expanded from the traditional China Studies focus on the humanities to include fields such as anthropology, sociology, health policy, and economics.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAnd then in the last 30 years, it\u2019s opened up much broader, and the sciences, applied sciences, the professional schools all have developed very substantial interactions with China,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about hundreds of scholars across Harvard University that have had active research with Chinese institutions.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As Chinese universities were re-entering the international community, the Chinese state was doing the same. Deng\u2019s market reforms began to modernize China\u2019s economy, and China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001. From 1976 to 2019, the Chinese economy did not contract.</span></p> <p><span>A significant factor in China\u2019s rise has been investing in universities, allowing the PRC to craft better policies, innovate new technologies, and elevate its international status. \u201cThey have self-consciously tried to make China part of the global system of higher education,\u201d Kirby says.</span></p> <p><span>The PRC has invested trillions of dollars over the past 20 years to modernize its higher education system. Once at a deficit \u2014 in terms of finances, faculty, and quality of scholarship across most disciplines \u2014 China and its universities have ascended global rankings to rival established universities in Europe and North America.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn the past it used to be that they had nobody, and we brought the ideas, the methods, and produced the findings. But now they have plenty of good people doing good research,\u201d Kleinman says. Research is no longer \u201cneocolonial,\u201d he says, but truly collaborative: \u201cWhat we learn in China is as important for here, in the U.S., as it is in China.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The balance of power that for decades undergirded the Harvard-China relationship may have begun to shift in recent years. As China\u2019s economy and higher education system have developed, Harvard has continued building collaborative relationships, but perhaps out of necessity \u2014 many of the world\u2019s top academics, labs, and studies, not to mention funding, are now in China. And where China was once almost devoid of foreign scholars, interest in China is now ubiquitous: Harvard competes with top universities from across the world for access to Chinese talent and resources.</span></p> <p><span>Even the influence of the Harvard China Health Partnership has declined, says Professor Winnie Yip, the partnership\u2019s current director. But it has not vanished, she explains, due to a widespread network of research collaborations and close relationships with high levels of government.</span></p> <p><span>The HCHP continues to prove itself uniquely useful to Chinese policy-makers, in particular through its \u201csocial experiment\u201d model \u2014 implementing and testing large-scale policies with local governments, something other universities do not or cannot attempt. \u201cChina watches very carefully, who does surveys or may find secrets about China, but they trust us, that we will not try to undermine China,\u201d Hsiao says. \u201cThat\u2019s where trust is such an important thing, and it takes decades to build up that relationship.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>To strengthen these relationships, the University created the Harvard China Fund in 2006, initially providing $15 million and committing another $50 million over the next decade to advance the interests of students and faculty, as well as \u201cHarvard\u2019s presence,\u201d in China. In 2011, the Harvard China Fund opened a center in Shanghai to help faculty host events.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cChina is home to many of the best and fastest growing research universities in the world today,\u201d Kirby says. \u201cIf we are to remain a great research university, you have to find means of collaborating with others.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The number of Chinese students and scholars at Harvard has increased each year since 2012. Harvard and Chinese scholars regularly co-author groundbreaking research. The Business School, Kennedy School, School of Public Health, and Medical School all provide executive training programs for Chinese philanthropists, business leaders, officials, doctors, and more. Every Harvard president since Rudenstine has visited China, met with the Chinese president, and given a public speech at a major Chinese university.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, China and its universities continue to have a vested interest in working with Harvard and its scholars, often considered global standard-bearers of academic excellence. \u201c[China is] investing a huge amount in higher education,\u201d Professor Elizabeth J. Perry, a former director of the Fairbank Center and current director of the Yenching Institute, says. \u201cI think they appreciate competition in the 21st century is going to hinge in large part on innovation. And innovation is going to hinge on having world class universities, and Harvard is generally regarded as a world class university. And so China wants to know what\u2019s going on here.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Mutual benefit and decades-old trust, however, won\u2019t guarantee the future of the Harvard-China relationship. If China\u2019s economic and academic ascent has led to more fruitful and equal academic cooperations, this rise has also been perceived by some American policymakers and leaders as a threat to American hegemony.</span></p> <p><span>Xiao Lu, a Chinese climate scientist, joined Professor Daniel Jacob\u2019s Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group as a postdoctoral fellow this past October after waiting a month for his visa application to undergo \u201cadministrative processing.\u201d He received a one-year visa that, once expired, does not permit re-entry to the U.S., effectively barring him from visiting home.</span></p> <p><span>Lu\u2019s predicament, like that of the thousands of visiting Chinese scholars in the U.S. who use the same visa, is in part the byproduct of the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive stance toward China, stoked by the PRC\u2019s increasing relative power. Since 2018, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray has warned repeatedly about the Chinese state using intellectual espionage to \u201csteal its way up the economic ladder,\u201d which he deems \u201cthe broadest, most challenging, most significant threat we face as a country.\u201d Wray is especially hostile toward Chinese scholars: \u201cWe know they use some Chinese students in the U.S. as nontraditional collectors of our intellectual property,\u201d he accused at a conference in February.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSome of my friends were even rejected or suspended for half a year. That\u2019s really a problem,\u201d Lu says \u2014 they have to start research late, or even find an alternative program. \u201cMy plan is that if I can go back before the expiration of this visa, [I will] visit my family, but if I cannot go back before the expiration, I have to stay here.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The FBI currently has about 1,000 investigations into Chinese technology theft in the U.S. The investigations have especially focused on scholars associated with the Thousand Talents Program, a recruitment system China has used since 2008 to attract talented Chinese and foreign academics overseas, and which the Bureau alleges is a mechanism for siphoning American innovation.</span></p> <p><span>The federal government\u2019s hostility toward Chinese academics reflects increasing American anxiety over China\u2019s growing technological and economic prowess. Professor Graham T. Allison, a leading national security analyst with a focus on China, sees the FBI investigations as signs of \u201ca classical Thucydides rivalry, in which a meteoric rising China is threatening to displace the U.S. as a world power.\u201d Such rivalries, he adds, have historically led to war.</span></p> <p><span>In recent years, the Chinese government has poured money into research universities, with its spending on research and development increasing by 17 percent on average each year since 2000, compared to a roughly four percent average increase in the U.S. over the same period. The Thousand Talents Program offers a large salary, healthcare, and research funding in a nation whose government has consistently signaled a commitment to scientific research. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has repeatedly proposed cutting research funding by billions of dollars.</span></p> <p><span>In 2008, when Thousand Talents began, China submitted roughly half as many patent applications as the U.S.; a decade later, China submitted three times as many. International talent, an engine of American innovation in cutting-edge science, is leaving: Total foreign enrollment in U.S. universities has dropped since 2016, and increasing numbers of visiting Chinese scholars return home. China leads the way on 5G cell phone service and artificial intelligence. Though there have been high-profile incidents of Chinese nationals taking privileged information from the U.S., China\u2019s commitment to scientific research signals that it isn\u2019t merely \u201cstealing its way up the economic ladder,\u201d as Wray suggests.</span></p> <p><span>Given the perception of China threatening American technological leadership, the next question is, \u201cHow do we respond as a nation?\u201d, says Professor Christopher W. Stubbs, Harvard FAS Dean of Science. \u201cOne response would be to say, \u2018Okay, we have a new competitor, let\u2019s outcompete them by being smarter, being more agile, and investing more resources.\u2019 That\u2019s one path forward. Another path forward is to try to erect barriers.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Irrespective of geopolitical tensions, the FBI\u2019s particular assault on academia has drawn its own criticism. \u201cI don\u2019t even understand the term \u2018academic espionage,\u2019\u201d Elliott says. \u201cEspionage involves stealing secrets, something you\u2019re trying to keep private or away from someone. But unlike in a company, where you have inventions and things that you patent and you want to protect and you don\u2019t want anybody else to see, for academics the goal is to publish what you have learned. It\u2019s to share.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Stubbs also says the term \u201cespionage\u201d is misleading. The concern is not about spying, he says, but about Chinese academics not following the unwritten norms of U.S. academia: \u201cindividuals taking some element of the scientific process and snagging a piece of it, and running off to some other corner and doing something with it before that reaches the public domain,\u201d Stubbs explains. This violation of academic norms may be a particular threat from China, he says, due to the relationship between government, military, universities, and corporations.</span></p> <p><span>In November, Harvard formed two oversight committees in response to federal investigations into \u201cacademic espionage.\u201d One committee scrutinizes sensitive research projects, and the other makes sure FAS policies align with federal guidelines. Stubbs has admitted, however, that Harvard is \u201climited\u201d in its oversight capabilities.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[The] process of disclosure and approval is something that we expect all faculty and all members of our academic community to go through,\u201d Stubbs says. \u201cI think one of the things that we\u2019re struggling with is instances of non-disclosure\u201d \u2014 because such instances are inherently clandestine, they are difficult to identify.</span></p> <p><span>This past winter, Harvard became directly and publicly embroiled in the FBI\u2019s investigations into Chinese \u201cacademic espionage.\u201d Zaosong Zheng, an HMS-affiliated researcher from China, was arrested in December at Logan for trying to smuggle 21 vials of sensitive biological material out of the country. Just over a month later, federal prosecutors charged Chemistry Department Chair Charles M. Lieber of not disclosing contracts with and funding received from the Chinese government. An FBI agent characterized the Lieber and Zheng incidents as \u201cmanifestations of the China threat.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Lieber, in 2011, formed a joint nanotechnology lab with the Wuhan University of Technology without authority on behalf of Harvard. A court affidavit also alleges that Lieber did not report payments he was receiving through the Thousand Talents Program.</span></p> <p><span>Under an agreement with WUT, under which he received a salary, Lieber was directed \u201cto guide the advancement of disciplines or scientific research institutes to become first class disciplines or scientific research institutes in China or the world, especially in frontier areas\u201d \u2014 a capacity-building function the FBI has characterized as quasi-treasonous.</span></p> <p><span>Though Lieber\u2019s arrest made national headlines, Stubbs says the incident has not triggered any changes in the work Harvard has done over the past two years to strengthen internal review processes.</span></p> <p><span>And though the Thousand Talents Program has been much maligned in the wake of Lieber\u2019s arrest, it is not unusual for nations to recruit foreign talent. Many other countries, such as Britain, Germany, and France, have invested tens of millions of dollars in national funds to recruit foreign researchers. Indeed, Chinese talent is a key benefit of the Harvard-China relationship.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cChina\u2019s economic rise has fundamentally transformed the way that our classrooms look,\u201d Elliott says. Having access to Chinese scholars and students, drawn from the world\u2019s largest population, has tremendous potential upsides. \u201cWhen you\u2019re able to include 1.4 billion [people] in your talent pool, you\u2019re going to get a lot more good talent in the mix,\u201d he adds.</span></p> <p><span>Even absent \u201cThucydides rivalry\u201d-induced war, FBI investigations have already had a grave effect on those members of China\u2019s talent pool at the University.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI worry that there is \u2014 as there was in the 1950s \u2014 a racialist attitude on the part of the American government when it looks at scientists and graduate students of Chinese and East Asian background,\u201d Kirby says.</span></p> <p><span>One visiting Chinese professor at Harvard, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of her comments, says fear permeates conversations among Chinese scholars in the U.S. \u201cWe discuss internally, we have those WeChat groups, people think these tensions between the U.S. and China could impact the normal collaboration between China and the U.S,\u201d she says. \u201cIt causes fear and nerves.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The many layers of anxiety \u2014 indeterminate periods of administrative processing, delayed starts to research, inability to visit home, racialized treatment \u2014 may dissuade Chinese scholars from studying in the U.S., or at least make them hesitate. The trend of decreasing numbers of Chinese students at American universities has not yet been reflected at Harvard, perhaps as a result of the long history of visiting scholars and bottom-up collaborations.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat would really be tragic, if there was any degradation in our ability to work with Chinese students,\u201d says Jacob, who runs a joint lab for air quality with Nanjing University for Information Science &amp; Technology. Working with China on climate change and air quality is especially important because of the large amounts of pollution in China and the huge amount of resources China invests in tackling these problems, Jacob says.</span></p> <p><span>The Chinese graduate students and postdocs I spoke with gushed about doing research at Harvard, pointing to excellent faculty, abundant resources, and enriching seminars. \u201cPeking University also has weekly seminars, but the level will be quite lower than the standard at Harvard,\u201d Lu says. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference between the world famous and nationally famous university.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Yet when asked specifically about Harvard\u2019s importance and their future plans, the praise was less effusive \u2014 in their final estimations, Harvard may not be that special. \u201cI want to go back to China because funding and jobs are similar with those in the U.S.,\u201d Ke Li, another postdoc in Jacob\u2019s group, says.</span></p> <p><span>\u201c[A] postdoc in the U.S. is not that necessary,\u201d Lu says. Friends and colleagues struggling to apply for a visa, he adds, can go to Europe or just stay in China. He himself came to the U.S. specifically to work with Jacob, not because Harvard is generally better than Chinese universities. \u201cFor research itself, [working at Harvard or in China] doesn\u2019t have too much difference,\u201d Lu says. \u201cIt just depends on the advisor. I don\u2019t think it depends on Harvard or Peking University.\u201d As Chinese universities rise, their American counterparts\u2019 relative prestige \u2014 even Harvard\u2019s \u2014 falls.</span></p> <p><span>Teng Biao has grown accustomed to the reach of China\u2019s \u201clong arm,\u201d as he calls it \u2014 the Chinese government\u2019s attempts to influence and censor scholars and activists not only within its borders, but abroad. In 2016, he alleged that the American Bar Association refused to publish his book on human rights in China due to pressure from the CCP. His wife was fired from her position at a Chinese-owned company in the U.S., where she had worked for 17 years, likely due to Teng\u2019s activism.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cEven in the United States, I was not able to avoid the harassment and punishment from the Chinese government,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Before Xi\u2019s rise to power, scholarly criticism was an important source of advice for Chinese officials. \u201cChinese political leaders in modern times have often shown themselves to be intolerant of dissent, and yet the wiser ones have often tried to find means of reading and understanding critique,\u201d Kirby says.</span></p> <p><span>But since Xi became China\u2019s president in 2013, the CCP has shored up party rule, tightening restrictions on academic freedom. Cameras record classes at top universities, professors who publish works critical of the Party have been fired, and critical books are taken off shelves.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely true that there is much greater freedom of expression within the walls of the university than outside those walls,\u201d Kirby says. \u201cAnd one of the unfortunate things over the last several years under President Xi Jinping, is that those walls have been actually getting tighter and higher.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In times of geopolitical conflict, such as the current U.S.-China tensions, the academy walls can create crucial spaces to carry out international discussions and level criticism that would otherwise be silenced. People not in the government, but who still interact with their governments, Allison says, \u201ccan often explore areas of shared interest better than they could if they were in government, or even explore thoughts that would be radical or even contrary to either the Chinese or American government.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The instructive analogy, Allison continues, is the Cold War, when science diplomacy between the U.S. and Soviet Union played a key role in launching an internal transformation in the USSR under Mikhael Gorbachev. A similar relationship, or at least fragments of it, may be unfolding today \u2014 in the work of the Harvard China Health Partnership, joint climate change labs, Harvard social scientists who study China, and others.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOur faculty continue to go, and I go, to China to work, to research, also to give public lectures, sometimes on issues that perhaps our Chinese colleagues are not able to talk about so directly themselves,\u201d Kirby says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re invited to do so perhaps in part because they\u2019re not able to talk about some such issues themselves. It may well be that international university connections such as those with Harvard are a kind of an intellectual safety valve for a system that actually needs some open windows for ideas, but at the moment feels too fearful to allow those windows to be fully open at home.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But as China\u2019s global power has increased, its government has become better able to extend its \u201clong arm\u201d into campuses overseas \u2014 even Harvard\u2019s, it seems, perhaps threatening the University\u2019s academic walls and intellectual safety valves.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen China became more powerful, it used its economic and political power to try and influence other countries,\u201d Teng says. \u201cThe number one priority of the Chinese Communist Party is the one party rule. They want to ensure an international atmosphere which will be in favor of China\u2019s politics.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In November, 2019, Teng was to speak at Columbia University on a panel titled \u201cPanopticism with Chinese Characteristics.\u201d The event was cancelled, purportedly for bureaucratic reasons, though the panellists believe Chinese Communist Party pressure was responsible. After the University of California, San Diego hosted the Dalai Lama \u2014 who has been called a \u201ctraitor\u201d by China over his stance on Tibet \u2014 at its 2017 commencement, the PRC suspended funding for Chinese scholars seeking to study at UCSD and terminated several collaborative agreements. Chinese officials regularly deliver complaints to universities hosting events on sensitive issues and even offer scholars money to modify research critical of China.</span></p> <p><span>China\u2019s economic and academic rise has made the PRC depend less and less on foreign wealth and expertise, enabling direct interference in foreign universities. Chinese government funding, Chinese students and their tuitions, contracts with Chinese companies, entry into China, collaborating with Chinese scholars, joint programs with Chinese labs and universities \u2014 every benefit accompanying China\u2019s rise is also a lever for its long arm, a resource to extend or withdraw. The balance of the asymmetrical relationship has shifted.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWestern institutions, think tanks, universities, they don\u2019t want to anger the Chinese government because they want to keep a good relationship with their Chinese counterparts,\u201d Teng says.</span></p> <p><span>The particular effect of Xi\u2019s tightening of academic walls and extension of the CCP\u2019s long arm on Harvard\u2019s campus extend beyond the cancellation of Teng\u2019s event. Scholars at the Fairbank Center, for instance, have found it more difficult to research Chinese contemporary society and history, two particularly sensitive topics: archives in China are harder to access, Chinese interlocutors are more reticent, and visiting scholars and delegations have been restricted from leaving China.</span></p> <p><span>And, given Harvard\u2019s status in the international academic hierarchy, Chinese authorities may be particularly interested in the University. \u201cWe\u2019ve had Chinese citizens at Harvard, who are clearly doing the bidding of the Chinese state, coming and sitting in on talks and taking notes and reporting back,\u201d Perry says. She similarly suspects Chinese citizens of reporting on visiting Chinese scholars\u2019 activities.</span></p> <p><span>Yet Harvard\u2019s academic walls endure: China Studies at Harvard were born in a struggle over academic freedom, when John K. Fairbank persisted despite Senator Senator Joe McCarthy accusing him of \u201closing China\u201d to communism. Today, the University provides a platform for scholarship and perspectives the CCP condemns, from exiled dissidents to courses on Tiananmen. Simultaneously, Harvard maintains deep interpersonal and institutional relationships to Chinese academics, companies, universities, and the highest level of government.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think it\u2019s status. Harvard has a special, extremely special status in China,\u201d Kleinman says, suggesting a possible theory for how the University maintains its balancing act. \u201cI think that\u2019s the long history of China\u2019s involvement with Harvard,\u201d he adds \u2014 a historic relationship distinct from that of the U.S. and Chinese governments.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen you go to China, you would think there\u2019s only one great university in the world,\u201d Kleinman adds \u2014 an inflated status that, in his experience, Harvard doesn\u2019t enjoy in other Asian countries.</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of just how unique Harvard\u2019s \u201cstatus\u201d is in China \u2014 other schools, such as Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, enjoy similar connections \u2014 Chinese leadership and universities certainly have a vested interest in maintaining the Harvard-China relationship.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s enormous curiosity among the Chinese leadership on this,\u201d Kirby says \u2014 they want to learn how Harvard works. He adds, \u201cThere\u2019s an enormous amount of respect for Harvard, in part because of the outstanding Chinese students who have come here over the course of the past 100 or more years.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And there is also a deep commitment, on Harvard\u2019s side, to providing a platform for clashing perspectives \u2014 what Elliott dubs as a \u201cforeign policy\u201d built around dialogue and \u201cVeritas.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe largest benefit of having the University president go to China, and in every case speak at a major Chinese University in a public setting in a speech that is made public, and then to have similar private conversations, is to continue to give our views, in the most public of settings, on the core values of the University,\u201d Kirby says.</span></p> <p><span>History, status, academic excellence, \u201cVeritas\u201d \u2014 these are reasons Harvard and China are uniquely useful to one another. It may also be that the mechanism of the Harvard-China relationship, bottom up connections between mutually interested faculty, insulates the University from the more devastating effects of China\u2019s long arm.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI never received any pushback of any sort from the University on programming that might be considered sensitive in China,\u201d says Daniel Murphy, the Fairbank Center\u2019s Executive Director. \u201cNot only that, but even in some alternate universe where they wanted to push back, they don\u2019t even have a good way to do it.\u201d Programming occurs at such a grassroots level \u2014 through colleagues and personal networks \u2014 that it would be almost impossible for the University to intervene, he explains.</span></p> <p><span>Yet on March 10, 2015, only a few hours before his flight\u2019s departure, Teng Biao had to pause his travel preparations and make his way to Alford\u2019s office. He entered Harvard\u2019s physical walls, only to be brought further into the reach of China\u2019s long arm. What caused the University\u2019s foreign policy stance, at least momentarily, to bend?</span></p> <p><span>Absent further comment from Alford, it\u2019s difficult to know. Perhaps Alford or another Harvard administrator had direct contact with, or was contacted by, PRC leadership; perhaps a Harvard administrator decided on their own to preemptively censor the event. A meeting between the presidents of Harvard and the PRC may have provided unique potential for conflict; Teng Biao and Chen Guangcheng may be uniquely controversial figures. It is likely that Alford and Teng\u2019s relationship meant the shield of decentralization Murphy described did not apply.</span></p> <p><span>What is clear is that even if Teng Biao was the victim of a one-time exception at Harvard, the cancellation is not exceptional but rather a flashpoint in the evolving relationship between Chinese and American universities, between the Chinese and American governments. There may be a history of Harvard-China collaboration, as well as a history of universities acting as safety valves during tense geopolitical moments \u2014 but the nexus of racialist U.S. rhetoric, rising authoritarianism under President Xi, and shifting global power dynamics between the world\u2019s two superpowers has no historical precedent. Harvard\u2019s prestige may have once served as a backstop for the long arm, but the defense now seems partial at best. And if one such incident occurred at the University, it opens the possibility for more.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe censorship, the self-censorship, is everywhere,\u201d Teng says.</span></p> <p><span><strong><em>Correction: April 24, 2020</em></strong></span></p> <p><span><em>A previous version of this article misstated the university from which Teng Biao was dismissed.

Aggressively placing the blame for a crisis on another group whose imminent rise has been a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/13/china-is-the-most-serious-threat-to-the-united-states-james-jones.html\">major concern</a> isn\u2019t problematic because it is baseless, but because it is natural.</span></p> <p><span>The narrative, however false, has practically written itself: A Chinese person ate something they shouldn\u2019t have, and now thousands of us have a deadly disease. On top of that, they have the audacity to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/coronavirus-pandemic-worsens-so-do-u-s-china-relations-n1162856\">blame us</a> for the virus! Boo them, go us!</span></p> <p><span>What is important is that statements like these erode the great bulwark of American democracy, classical liberalism\u2019s value of tolerance. It is in times like these \u2014 when democracy\u2019s greatest defense is most vulnerable \u2014 that its maintenance is most necessary.</span></p> <p><span>The foundational idea of liberalism is that the individual, not the family or society, is the main moral and political decision-maker. But this is not the way our brains are wired to think.</span></p> <p><span>Humans are <a href=\"http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Sherif/\">very</a> good at parsing out \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/topics/political-polarization/\">disliking one another</a> for no good reason; our instinct is to treat the individual solely as the embodiment of a group. We create \u201cothers\u201d as naturally as we breathe.</span></p> <p><span>I am not, after all, discussing the individual guilt, or lack thereof, of the first person who contracted the coronavirus, precisely because we tend not to focus on individuals. It is the \u201cChina\u201d virus that plagues America, and the 5 million Chinese and Chinese Americans living in the United States who will become \u201cother.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Because of its emphasis on the individual, however, liberal democracy claims that group affiliation is only one facet of the individual\u2019s existence. I am a Chinese American, a Hong Kong resident, and a Leverett House member. My affiliation with any of those groups does not make me responsible for the spread of the coronavirus. It doesn\u2019t matter whether my affiliation is voluntary or not, or even if it is clear that some members of these larger groups have done wrong, because in American liberal democracy we decide moral blame and guilt on an individual basis.</span></p> <p><span>This idea of individual culpability is not only codified in our own laws but is the hallmark of international relations. Article 33 of the fourth Geneva Convention declares collective punishment, punishing a group for individual transgressions, to be a war crime.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019m not trying to equate President Trump, or anyone who has or will blame everything Chinese for the coronavirus, with war criminals. My point, if anything, is to remind us that angry, frustrated, ordinary people can easily act in a regrettable manner against a group of people they perceive as \u201cother\u201d. Trump is not an anomaly; a successful liberal democracy is.</span></p> <p><span>Liberal democracy doesn\u2019t try to suppress our human instincts and reactions, but builds \u201chedges\u201d to guide them. A successful liberal democracy isn\u2019t about unseeing the other, but institutionalizing ways for tolerating differences.</span></p> <p><span>However, these institutions of tolerance within liberal democracy in turn depend on a basic commitment from its citizens. The promises of liberal democracy <a href=\"https://www.fjc.gov/history/timeline/us-v-cruikshank\">cannot </a>be <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/163/537\">upheld </a>by <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/323us214\">illiberal </a><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/347/483\">individuals</a>.</span></p> <p><span>The danger to liberal government is greatest during times of crisis, conflicts, and mass fear because that is when we tend to default to our illiberal attitudes. When times are good, it is easy to tolerate the tolerable, or even <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/08/09/210138278/japanese-internment-redress\">condemn our past transgressions against groups</a>. The question is how we will act when the chips are down.</span></p> <p><span>During these times of crisis we need to cherish tolerance because our natural tendency for intolerance will only make things worse. John Locke, one of the greatest intellectual fathers of classical liberalism, wrote his \u201c<a href=\"https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/locke/toleration.pdf\">A Letter Concerning Toleration</a>\u201d at a time when bloody religious warfare was the norm, and being religiously other was a death sentence. His novel claim was that the best way for a religious sect to both spread its message and deal with the imminent threat of violence was not to take control of the government and prosecute a hostile group first, but to actively adhere to, and even preach, a doctrine of tolerance.</span></p> <p><span>Today when we learn about Locke, liberal democracy, and tolerance, we think about (or debate) its potential: the vast amount of progress, or lack thereof, that we associate with a government dedicated to protecting \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\u201d. We should remember that tolerance is not just about our prosperity, but also about preventing us from destroying each other. Tolerance itself won't stop the virus, but it is the bare minimum of any successful solution.</span></p> <p><span>America is such an advanced, liberal democracy that we are tolerant even of the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/395/444\">hatefully intolerant</a>. Indeed, you have every right, political or natural, to give in to anger, fear, and frustration; spew hate; or propagate any amount of us-versus-them rhetoric you like. But know this: It is you who are destroying what makes America great, not a China virus.</span></p> <p><span><em>Eric Yang \u201922, is a History concentrator in Leverett House.

{"title": "Forced Rivalries | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Daniel L. Leonard", "body": "<p><span>As we collectively reel from the devastating impact of coronavirus \u2014 an impact made far worse by the Trump administration\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html\">inept response</a> \u2014 I figured now would be a great time to revisit another of this administration\u2019s forgotten blunders.</span></p> <p><span>On December 20, 2019, the Trump administration inaugurated the United States Space Force as the sixth branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, with the <a href=\"https://www.spaceforce.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheet\">mission</a> to organize, train, and equip space forces \u201cin order to protect U.S. and allied interests in space.\u201d However, this was no giant leap for mankind. All the administration did was rename the Air Force Space Command (which has existed <a href=\"https://www.afspc.af.mil/About-Us/AFSPC-History/\">since 1982</a>) the \u201cUnited States Space Force,\u201d and designate this new group as its own, independent branch of the military.</span></p> <p><span>Trump\u2019s decision to create the Space Force was met by most people with lighthearted derision. Folks on Twitter lampooned the decision to use <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/18/politics/space-force-uniforms-trnd/index.html\">Earth-tone camouflage</a> for the official Space Force uniform, as well as the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/01/25/space-force-logo/\">similarities</a> between the Space Force\u2019s logo and the insignia of Star Trek\u2019s Starfleet Command. <a href=\"https://collider.com/steve-carell-space-force-filming-details/\">Steve Carell</a> is even working on a comedic \u201cSpace Force\u201d series for Netflix.</span></p> <p><span>But, for all the fun we can have at the Space Force\u2019s expense, it\u2019s important to recognize that its creation was a truly bad idea, for a number of reasons.</span></p> <p><span>First, it\u2019s redundant. As I explained, the Air Force Space Command already existed as a military group responsible for protecting U.S. interests in space. Why do we need a completely new branch to serve this purpose? The answer is that we don\u2019t, especially not at this time, when the threat to our space interests (namely, our satellites) is negligible. The creation of the Space Force will only lead to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/431090-so-far-creating-us-space-force-is-a-bureaucratic-mess\">more bureaucracy</a> within the military and a <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/congressional-report-space-force-would-cost-billions-more-than-dod-estimated/\">high financial burden</a> that will likely be shifted onto the taxpayers.</span></p> <p><span>If we do care about our extraterrestrial interests, it might sound like a good idea to create a branch with an exclusive focus on space. But, in reality, this will simply lead to less cohesion among the military. The branches of the Armed Forces are notoriously competitive; this has been especially true when it comes to outer space. When the \u201cspace race\u201d with the Soviet Union first began, the Army and the Navy <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/interservice-rivalry-that-delayed-americas-first-satellite-launch/\">competed</a> \u2014 rather than collaborated \u2014 to achieve space feats, such as being the first to launch an American satellite into orbit.</span></p> <p><span>It was later <a href=\"https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol2/v2chapter2-1.pdf\">decided</a> that NASA would be in charge of all civilian projects in space, while the Air Force would handle military operations in that realm. It\u2019s highly unlikely that the Air Force is ready to step back and relinquish control over space operations to the newly-formed Space Force. Besides, where does \u201cAir\u201d end and \u201cSpace\u201d begin? With scientists unable to<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/12/where-is-the-edge-of-space-and-what-is-the-karman-line/\"> agree</a> on a satisfactory answer to this question, military officials from each branch will certainly use the ambiguity to compete for the greatest jurisdiction possible.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, the creation of the Space Force sets a dangerous precedent \u2014 that space should be thought of as a military zone to be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/19/air-force-secretary-wilson-13-billion-space-force-proposal-is-bold.html\">dominated</a>.\u201d We saw this concept begin to play out during the Cold War \u2014 but, luckily, a <a href=\"https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties.html\">series of treaties</a> were able to restrict the militarization of space. This included the broadly-supported <a href=\"https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/outerspacetreaty.html\">Outer Space Treaty</a> of 1967, which (among other things) prevented nuclear weapons from ever being sent into orbit.</span></p> <p><span>A return to the era of the militarization of space is a bad idea. As some scientists have <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/scientists-warn-trumps-space-force-could-create-incentives-nations-build-1336633\">warned</a>, the creation of the Space Force could inspire other countries \u201cto focus on the development of space weaponry.\u201d And space weaponry \u2014 even the non-nuclear kind \u2014 can be highly deadly. Take, for example, a kinetic bombardment system like the Air Force\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/air-force-rods-from-god-kinetic-weapon-hit-with-nuclear-weapon-force-2017-9\">Project Thor</a>; this hypothetical weapon system, also called \u201cRods from the Gods,\u201d would drop massive tungsten rods on Earth targets, creating an impact on par with a nuclear weapon.</span></p> <p><span>And even a small-scale battle in orbit could have devastating effects. Scientists warn of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/wstf/site_tour/remote_hypervelocity_test_laboratory/micrometeoroid_and_orbital_debris.html\">Kessler syndrome</a>,\u201d a possible scenario in which a chain reaction of colliding space debris creates a cloud of tiny junk flying around the Earth. This would likely destroy our satellites, as well as our chances to send anything else into space for decades.</span></p> <p><span>But, alas, the Space Force has been created \u2014 an action that will be very difficult for any future president to reverse. And I suppose it was only a matter of time before we\u2019d have a branch of the military dedicated to space, since space is becoming a bigger priority as the century progresses. It was an unfortunate inevitability that world governments would begin to see outer space as a domain of warfare akin to land, sea, and air.</span></p> <p><span>So, if the Space Force is here to stay, I (naively) hope that it will serve one purpose, and one purpose only: preserving peace in outer space. And I\u2019m not referring to the American vision of \u201cpeace\u201d that means \u201cpeace over here through war over there,\u201d but a genuine peace for all parties involved. Because, if space does become the next realm of warfare, then we\u2019re all equally screwed.</span></p> <p><span><em>Daniel L.

{"title": "The Coronavirus Crisis Demands Harvard\u2019s Leadership | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\u201cAt times like this the world looks to Harvard for leadership, intellectual and otherwise,\u201d wrote University President Lawrence S. Bacow last week in his \u201cDear Colleagues\u201d letter about the University\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis. While he mentioned that Harvard\u2019s dorms have been all but emptied, he said nothing about deploying those dorms as a life-saving resource for new coronavirus patients.</span></p> <p><span>Sadly, President Bacow just wrote once again to the Harvard community, this time to report that he and his wife Adele have tested positive for COVID-19. This upsetting news brings into yet higher relief the immediacy of the threat posed by this highly contagious virus.</span></p> <p><span>Tufts has already announced its<a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/18/opinion/higher-educations-role-fighting-covid-19/\"> readiness</a> to house patients afflicted by the new coronavirus.  Middlebury College has done the same. So far, Harvard has remained silent.</span></p> <p><span>According to the<a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/healtheqt/hospital-beds.htm\"> Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</a>, the United States has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants \u2013 substantially fewer than the 3.2 beds per 1,000 in Italy\u2019s overwhelmed hospital system. We all know the deadly results of that country\u2019s lack of coronavirus preparedness. South Korea has more than four times as many beds per capita as the U.S. \u2014 one of a number of factors contributing to that country\u2019s superior preparedness.</span></p> <p><span>We will need 200,000 intensive care unit beds to cope with a moderate coronavirus outbreak, according to<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/upshot/coronavirus-biggest-worry-hospital-capacity.html\"> Professor Aaron E. Carroll</a> at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Hundreds of thousands and possibly millions more will be needed in the likely event that the virus becomes more pervasive. Today we have 45,000 ICU beds, most of them already occupied by currently sick patients. We need to fill an enormous gap in weeks, not months or years. Repurposing our now-vacant dormitories as hospital wards is one key way to begin. Some dorms, due to their configuration, might best be deployed in caring for non-ICU patients, freeing up in-hospital capacity for patients who are more gravely ill. Healthcare workers who are in close contact with COVID-19 patients might also need temporary housing to spare their families unnecessary exposure to the disease. Other dorms might be relatively well-suited to patients needing intensive care. Determining these resource allocations should be assigned to smart, experienced healthcare professionals.</span></p> <p><span>However Harvard\u2019s dorm beds and related food services are used, they must be made available now. President Bacow must show courage and leadership in stepping up to this challenge.</span></p> <p><span>Some might say, \u201cWhy not deploy hotels as COVID-19 care facilities?\u201d This, in fact, is<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-weighs-turning-hotels-into-hospitals-11584556841\"> now being negotiated</a> by officials in New York City, which is also making plans to turn the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center into a coronavirus hospital. Rooms in now-empty hotels, together with currently idled hotel kitchens, can offer invaluable healthcare services if promptly deployed. In the face of this urgent humanitarian need, we must deploy all available resources.</span></p> <p><span>Making hundreds of thousands of beds available to COVID-19 and other patients is essential \u2014 but of course, it will not address other grave deficiencies in our ability to combat this pandemic. In the U.K.,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/uk-manufacturers-regear-factories-build-ventilators-nhs\"> Vauxhall and Airbus</a> are gearing up to manufacture ventilator components using 3D printers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has challenged these and other manufacturers to help produce 20,000 ventilators in the next two weeks. To date, no parallel action has been taken here in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>Along with the shortfall in ventilators, we\u2019re all aware of the shocking scarcity of protective gear for healthcare workers who are already placing themselves at enormous risk in treating coronavirus patients. On March 20, after weeks of delay, President Trump invoked the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/488632-trump-to-trigger-defense-production-act-in-coronavirus-fight-says-schumer\">Defense Production Act</a>, giving the federal government authority to compel U.S. manufacturers to produce equipment essential to fighting this dread disease. No sooner had he done so, however, than he began backpedaling on mandating the immediate retooling by textile companies, medical equipment manufacturers, and others that could begin to fill the desperate shortfall in life-saving ventilators and vital safety equipment such as masks, gowns, and gloves. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-shuns-use-of-law-allowing-control-over-manufacturers-11584927164\">His weak excuse</a> in this moment of dire need: \u201cThe concept of nationalizing our businesses is not a good concept.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Requisitioning the hospital beds needed to care for COVID-19 patients is another step the federal government should be taking. But Harvard should not wait before taking its own decisive action. It should immediately collaborate with partners in government and the healthcare sector to make sure its facilities are fully tapped.</span></p> <p><span>President Bacow ended his letter to Harvard colleagues with the Talmudic saying that saving one life is equivalent to saving the entire world. Harvard has a historic opportunity to save hundreds if not thousands of lives. It must not walk away from this challenge.</span></p> <p><span><em>Philip N.

It aims to give graduates freedom to pursue public sector employment or other relatively low-paying jobs despite high levels of debt accrued by many who attend the Law School.</span></p> <p><span>The Trump administration\u2019s March 20 decision to suspend federal student loan payments and waive interest on these loans during the ongoing national emergency \u2014 as well as potential relief packages being debated by Congress \u2014 would reduce the amount graduates must pay towards their loans each month.</span></p> <p><span>The letter \u2014 signed by roughly 50 current and anticipated future participants of the Protection Plan \u2014 states that the Law School should refrain from recalculating financial aid to reflect graduates\u2019 lower loan payments.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe basically don't want the intention of assistance from the federal government to be offset by a corresponding and equal reduction in assistance from Harvard, because then it's not assistance at all, right?\u201d said Law School graduate Alexandra M. Jordan, who signed the letter.</span></p> <p><span>The letter noted that Law School graduates anticipate that financial challenges may arise during the pandemic and further asked that Harvard modify LIPP policies to give participants affected by an economic crisis increased flexibility.</span></p> <p><span>The suggestions included waiving interest on loans held by the University, loosening requirements for submitting income tax returns to the school, and allowing those who take non-legal jobs to be eligible for assistance.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPublic interest lawyers around the world will need any extraordinary assistance they can get for what\u2019s coming -- medical bills, childcare costs, travel restrictions, job loss, and political instability, among other challenges,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cWe hope that Harvard will take this global crisis as an opportunity to show leadership in its commitment to public interest work.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>LIPP associate director Natasha D. Onken replied to the authors of the letter in an email, writing that the program will modify its paperwork requirement for the May application period in light of the United States Treasury Department extending the income tax filing deadline to July 15.</span></p> <p><span>She also wrote that the Law School would advise graduates to continue with their regular loan payments and to only opt-in to federal relief opportunities if necessary. The email noted that suspending payments may impact future eligibility for LIPP, however.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cFor those participants who are in LIPP we would recommend they continue to make the loan payments for which they received assistance if they are able,\u201d Onken wrote. \u201cHowever, if their financial circumstances have changed and they are experiencing financial hardship related to COVID\u201019 we would recommend utilizing the federal government\u2019s options.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>According to Onken\u2019s email, the program will review additional changes to LIPP policy as the coronavirus situation continues to evolve.</span></p> <p><span>In response to a request for additional comment, Onken wrote in an email that LIPP has provided comprehensive aid to thousands of graduates and aims to continue this mission through the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAs they were during the 2008 financial downturn, need-based financial aid programs, including the Low Income Protection Plan, will remain a top priority for Harvard Law School,\u201d Onken wrote.</span></p> <p><span>Still, Jordan said she hopes the letter will highlight issues that some graduates face making ends meet even with support from LIPP.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt means that folks who are doing work on the front lines \u2014 like trying to get people out of immigration detention centers, working as public defenders, people doing public interest legal work \u2014 are having a really hard time paying their bills even with this assistance,\u201d Jordan said.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Kelsey J.

{"title": "Hulu\u2019s \u2018Hillary\u2019 Thinks Back When We Should Look Forward | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Ellie M. Taylor", "body": "<p><span>Whether you love her or hate her, it is hard to deny that Hillary Clinton has lived a fascinating life as one of the most recognizable women in American politics. In a new four-hour docu-series on Hulu, Clinton\u2019s life is examined in grueling detail \u2014 from her childhood to her career as a lawyer to her life as first lady, senator, Secretary of State, and presidential candidate. Hours of interview footage with both Hillary and Bill Clinton, former president Barack Obama, and many other political insiders make this series replete with insight and reflection. However, given its release on the eve of another presidential election, the series forces viewers to confront what good it does to continue dwelling on 2016 as we approach Nov. 3.</span></p> <p><span>The documentary features exclusive interview footage with a demure and reflective Clinton, with clips carefully chosen to demonstrate her awareness of some of the fatal flaws of her campaign. These serve, effectively, as a video adaptation of her 2017 memoir \u201cWhat Happened.\u201d Clinton\u2019s commentary leaves no doubt in the viewer\u2019s mind that she is sharp-witted and intelligent. She gracefully acknowledges the way that confusion around possible scandals with her emails, Benghazi, and Whitewater fostered skepticism about her trustworthiness. Despite the questionable foundation of the allegations against her, she reflected that \u201ceven when something is disproved, people remember that the allegation was made,\u201d a claim made all the more believable by the numerous hostile news clips spliced between Clinton\u2019s interviews. Each one further paints her as the victim of the media\u2019s scrutiny.</span></p> <p><span>Bafflingly, Clinton discusses Bernie Sanders, her Democratic primary opponent, with far more ire than Donald Trump. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bobby/status/1236349383890931713?s=20\">clip that has gained traction on Twitter</a>, Clinton comments that \u201cnobody likes [Sanders], nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done, he was a career politician \u2026 [his message] was all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it.\u201d The documentary\u2019s choice to showcase this resentment felt ridiculous and misplaced, especially given its later discussion of Clinton\u2019s push for healthcare reform in the \u201990s, which is not significantly dissimilar from Sanders\u2019 advocacy of a universal healthcare system. The documentary\u2019s choice to highlight this resentment feels misplaced, especially when one considers the fundamental similarity between Clinton\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 ideologies. One has to question the editorial role played by the producers, and whether or not the choice was deliberate political calculus.</span></p> <p><span>Cinematically, the show diverges little from the documentary form \u2014 fluid and insightful, but unremarkable. Footage in each episode oscillates between the arc of Clinton\u2019s early career and her 2016 presidential campaign, positioning her run for president as the culminating moment of her life\u2019s work. While this structure runs the risk of feeling disjointed, each episode demands more of the viewer as a result. The choice allows for the stifling discomfort of rewatching the chaos of 2016 non-stop from beginning to end, an experience somewhat akin to watching embarrassing videos of your middle school self.</span></p> <p><span>But where \u201cHillary\u201d most excels is in posing thought-provoking questions about life as a public servant. Shots that rapidly change between Clinton\u2019s interviews, her media portrayals, and her interactions with constituents highlight, to great effect, the political balancing act of trying to please as many people as possible while remaining true to one\u2019s values. As the first female presidential nominee of a major party, Clinton is undoubtedly a trailblazer, and the viewer is forced to grapple with the role of trailblazers in creating change and how easily those pioneers can be demonized. Footage of Clinton\u2019s constituents questioning her choices about her career, her marriage, and even her smile provides clear evidence of how Clinton was vilified for her motivations and personal choices. The documentary makes clear how toxic life in the public eye can be, while not forcing the viewer to feel sympathetic to Clinton\u2019s personal struggles.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the show\u2019s insights, it is hard to ignore the way \u201cHillary\u201d expatiates on the 2016 election. And there is little chance that fixating on Clinton\u2019s loss is the most effective way to mobilize in 2020. Regret doesn\u2019t win elections. As discussed in the documentary, hope, the promise of change, and the belief in a better tomorrow does. \u201cHillary\u201d might be insightful in thinking about the past, but the show fails to effectively discuss causes that could help America\u2019s future. The latter would be closer to the show that voters need.</span></p>"}
{"title": "When Washing Hands Isn\u2019t Enough | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Reshini Premaratne", "body": "<p><span>About three weeks ago, I was in Austria, teasing my friend, Jocelyn, for wearing gloves and a mask to the Viennese opera. I was feeling confident that my study abroad program at the University of Cambridge would not get canceled. Now, with the benefit of hindsight, I realize I could not have miscalculated more. I have been relegated to self-isolation in my suburban home of Glen Allen, Virginia; Cambridge indeed moved its next term online; and I don\u2019t anticipate leaving the confines of the rudimentary routine I have established for the foreseeable future.</span></p> <p><span>Understandably, in these times of unpredictability and discomfort, anxiety and stress, and generally a fear of the unknown, Americans have had to tap into a sense of community in order to follow the necessary practices to keep people healthy and safe. Just as Pearl Harbor served as a rallying cry for Americans in World War II and Sept. 11 created a similar sense of nationalist solidarity, this coronavirus has enabled President Donald Trump to declare war on the \u201cother.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>However, in his willingness to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/coronavirus-outbreak-trump-blames-china-for-virus-again.html\">blame China</a> entirely for this pandemic, he\u2019s encouraged a similarly destructive behavior in the masses. While externalizing blame is not altogether a surprising approach from our president, it is not the kind of behavior we should practice societally or individually. The vast majority of Americans \u2014 myself included \u2014 did not take this virus seriously, and in doing so, unnecessarily endangered the lives of countless more people.</span></p> <p><span>When news broke of an imminent travel ban on visitors from Europe to the United States, signaling the severity of the pandemic, I still stubbornly took my flight from London to Boston instead of going straight home to my family. I refused to compromise on seeing my friends first, even though my same friend, Jocelyn, made exactly that sacrifice for the safety of herself, her friends at Harvard, and most prominently, her family. One of my best friends still decided to spend part of his spring break in Miami; others still went to the Bahamas or Puerto Rico or elsewhere to cling on to that quintessential college spring break experience. Hundreds of Harvard students still dartied and partied those final days of the on-campus semester before boarding flights to travel all across the country and world in the days after.</span></p> <p><span>It is true that not all of these decisions were in our control and certainly they were not made maliciously. Indeed, when I put myself back into those scenarios of two or three weeks ago, I do not believe the U.S. administration had adequately expressed the lifestyle change necessary for the health of our community. For me personally, I was mandated to return to the States, so adding an extra stop at Harvard seemed harmless at the time, especially because the Trump administration was maintaining a relaxed approach to the spread of the virus. Students were required to leave campus with short notice, so, especially for the seniors, large group gatherings seemed like a necessary way to celebrate those last in-person moments of the spring semester, and the Harvard administration did not admonish such behavior for days, allowing the practice to become a habit. My friends who still decided to travel to their spring break destinations regret not being forced to grasp the severity of the situation earlier; they now share sentiments of recognizing the health risk they posed to themselves, one another, their families, and numerous strangers they interacted with along the way.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, the lack of malicious intent does not rid us of our culpability. We can (and should!) wash our hands as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention advises, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can necessarily wash our hands of the guilt we may feel for how we as a student body, community, and country decided to respond to this crisis. And we shouldn\u2019t. Part of what pushed China to create a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html?referringSource=articleShare&amp;fbclid=IwAR2le7ZkpAeACh1sJK-YJuSUa-U40VCN7hs8q1Q9NAfxDfNMkbqaAZg9Q2w\">\u201cfail-safe\u201d system</a> to track contagions after the SARS epidemic was a recognition and understanding of the many ways they failed themselves and one another in the aftermath of the SARS outbreak. Even if that system did indeed fail this time around, it went a long way in helping China respond where the U.S. has fallen short. Guilt is not a comfortable feeling, but externalizing blame will only set up history to repeat itself.</span></p> <p><span>When I arrived back to campus, some friends decided to poke fun at how I had placed their lives and the lives of those they love in jeopardy by coming back. While I believe that was the same kind of mean-spirited and unproductive approach President Trump has taken to blame China for the pandemic that now touts the United States as its epicenter, there is an undeniable truth in the culpability they assign. I should and do apologize for the selfishness and thoughtlessness I demonstrated in returning to campus from my study abroad program in the United Kingdom. It was that kind of realization and sense of guilt that has effectively kept me at home for the past two weeks of quarantine, and that will continue to keep me social distancing until advised otherwise by trusted health experts.</span></p> <p><span>President Trump may want to blame China; Americans may want to blame the Miami spring breakers; my friends may want to blame me. But, ultimately, how we individually recognize the role we play in keeping ourselves and one another safe and, potentially more importantly, how we choose to impress upon others the significance of individual action can have a true impact. We can change the course of not just the next pandemic, but how we flatten the curve on this one. It isn\u2019t too late as long as we realize that simply washing our hands is not enough of a change in our behavior.</span></p> <p><span><em>Reshini Premaratne \u201921 is a joint concentrator in Social Studies and Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations in Currier House.

{"title": "The Law School\u2019s Brutal Response to COVID-19 | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I\u2019m a Belgian LL.M. student at Harvard Law School. Because of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, I was told to vacate my on-campus housing three days before the beginning of spring break. As an international student, the waiting and anguish were particularly acute: What to do and where to go, in a country that is not mine, thousands of miles away from my family? I hardly ate or slept for five days; I was too lost, shocked, sad, and panicked.</span></p> <p><span>And I was not the only one. Looking back, it is clear that many people are experiencing far worse things than I did. But I\u2019m still angry at the measures taken, or rather at the way these measures were taken, by the Law School to deal with this health crisis. I am strongly disappointed by the lack of humanity and the brutality materialized in a policy that appears to aim at the easiest solutions.</span></p> <p><span>On Tuesday, March 10 at 11:24 p.m., the Law School announced by email that any student residing in an on-campus residence who had another place to stay, including outside the U.S., was to move out by Sunday, March 22 at 4:00 p.m. I didn\u2019t see it coming. One week before, on March 2, I had contacted the administration to know whether it was better to cancel my trip to New Orleans. They replied, \u201cHarvard does not currently recommend cancelling planned trips within the US during Spring Break.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Law School gave students the opportunity to fill out a survey and explain why some were unable to leave their current dorm. I responded the next day that I did not want to go back to my home country because the situation in Europe seemed worse than in the U.S. and the risks of contamination in the airports or on the planes were substantial. This was also the advice of the Belgian Consulate. And I was not mentally ready to accept the idea that my LL.M. was over and that I had to leave the group of people with whom I had been living during the last months.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, while the Law School was deciding who could continue living in on-campus residences, President Donald Trump adopted successive restrictions on flights from continental Europe and the United Kingdom, for many of which the Center for Disease Control and Prevention had issued Level 3 travel alerts. Some European countries decided to start closing their borders as well. Many of us could not dither any longer.</span></p> <p><span>On Friday morning, when I saw that I still hadn't received a response to my request to stay on campus, I decided to go back to Belgium. If the Law School was not able to respond diligently on such an important issue, how many days would they need to deal with the rest? And in the following weeks, would they act in the best interest of their students or in the best interest of the institution? I left because I no longer had any trust in their leadership. I packed my bags in two days. I didn't have time to say goodbye to most of the people I\u2019ve been living and working with for seven months. That was the hardest part for me.</span></p> <p><span>On Saturday, March 14, at 11:04 am \u2014 after three long days \u2014 the Law School decided that I could stay in my dorm. Permission to remain in my on-campus residence came with an important caveat: I had to be able to move rooms quickly during the upcoming weeks, if this was made necessary by evolving circumstances and guidance from the University or state and federal governments. But you can\u2019t live like this. When you\u2019re drowning in uncertainties, you need certainty about housing. The email only reinforced my decision to go back to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span>After I went back, students previously living in dorms with shared bathrooms were relocated to my residence, the only facility on campus with private bathrooms. It seems clear to me that I was told to leave not because students in my residence were more likely to spread the virus, but because Harvard was rushing to get people out. I fully understand the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/corona-harvard-stanford-mit.html\">imperative</a> to \u201creduce the population density\u201d on campus \u201cto slow the spread of the virus.\u201d However, there is a difference between \u201cde-densifying\u201d and \u201cemptying.\u201d The Law School did what was best for itself. If there is hardly anyone left on campus, it is very unlikely that someone will catch the coronavirus and put the Law School in a difficult situation that they may be held responsible for. Drastic. Easy.</span></p> <p><span>Above all, I do not accept that the Law School did not inform us earlier of the measures it was thinking of taking so that we could prepare ourselves psychologically for the changes to come. I do not accept that the Law School did not include us in the decision-making process, although it concerned an important aspect of our life. I do not accept the coldness of some emails. I do not accept that a well-resourced institution shifted the negative consequences of this crisis mostly onto us, its students.</span></p> <p><span>I'll never forget the sadness or the anger I felt during the week Harvard sent its students away, but also the solidarity that sprung up around us. I don't know how many people spontaneously offered me housing, food, storage space, help with paperwork, or a car ride to the Boston airport. They have done much more for me than the Harvard administration, and I am infinitely grateful to them.</span></p> <p><span><em>Carine M.S.

{"title": "Labor, Pandemic, and the Corporate University | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "The Crimson Editorial Board", "body": "<p><span>COVID-19 has forced people around the world to reconsider some of the fundamental assumptions and structures of their lives. President Donald Trump signed the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html\">largest</a> stimulus <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/26/821457551/whats-inside-the-senate-s-2-trillion-coronavirus-aid-package\">package</a> in United States history, which sends money directly to adult Americans, delays student loan payments, and extends unemployment insurance to include freelance and gig workers.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard has not been immune from this dynamic. In particular, the University has been forced to reckon with the fine line it walks between community and corporation, especially in regards to labor relations. After all, like many employers, Harvard has had to decide who is essential and how, if at all, to support and compensate those who are not.</span></p> <p><span>On at least one of these questions, the University has flip-flopped. While it initially said all employees who could not work remotely would receive only <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/19/harvard-coronavirus-huds-custodians-paid-leave/\">30 days</a> of compensation and benefits, it has since <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/27/harvard-employee-pay-guarantee/\">extended</a> that guarantee through May after student advocates at Harvard Law School garnered more than 7,000 signatures for a petition advocating for the extension.</span></p> <p><span>Over the past year or so, Harvard, like many universities, has been pushed toward owning its role as a corporate employer. Graduate student unionization has forced the University to consider its obligations to many students not in terms of intellectual patronage but in terms of employment. Simultaneously, Division I NCAA athletes have gained the right to profit from sales of their names, images, and likenesses. And while these might be the two most obvious cases, as we <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/4/12/editorial-clarifying-labor-practices/\">pointed out</a> a year ago, they have brought Harvard\u2019s tenure practices, benefits, housing, and harassment allegation procedures to light as well.</span></p> <p><span>But do we really want the University to act like any old American employer? If it did, we might see very little support for employees \u2014 as evidenced by record-high unemployment figures. If Harvard is to be an employer, it cannot be so in the strictest, most corporate sense. Some compassion must prevail.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard employees \u2014 including full-time, part-time or contingent, and contracted workers \u2014 are not just laborers in the University factory, but members of our community with whom we are privileged to build personal relationships. In that sense, the University, uniquely positioned between corporation and community, has the opportunity to lead broader corporate thinking.</span></p> <p><span>Still, some big questions remain. Who counts as an \u201cessential\u201d employee and what does that term mean at a university? Is the necessity to support employees indicative of a failure on the part of the government or is this role justly left to employers? Should the crisis\u2019 end mark the limit of Harvard\u2019s commitment to more-than-typical generosity? Should time caps on <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/2/non-tenure-track-extension-petition/\">non-tenure</a> track appointments be extended, as has been done for many <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/21/harvard-coronavirus-tenure-clock-extended/\">tenure-track</a> faculty? And what is the scope of the broader community for which Harvard should accept responsibility \u2014 should others who depend on the University through more tenuous affiliations also receive assistance?</span></p> <p><span>As the University balances its private interests and obligation to society, Harvard\u2019s workers are canaries in the institution\u2019s labor mine. Under pandemic conditions, these individuals are uniquely vulnerable because of their extensive exposure to student spaces makes their university employment a primary source of danger to their health and productivity. Harvard\u2019s decision to extend pay and benefits to all employees, including many subcontractors, is the first step toward acknowledging our concern that workers may be neglected because of their employment status. These workers are valued members of our community, and we hope to see them safe and secure when we return to campus.</span></p> <p><span>These rapid changes in compensation adjustments challenges other academic institutions to define their fundamental responsibilities toward staff. We laud Harvard\u2019s decision to provide more complete support during the pandemic, and we encourage other institutions with the financial means to do the same for as long as is necessary.</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, we encourage the University to utilize the vast resources at its disposal to assist in addressing the disparate health burdens borne by the broader local community. In light of skyrocketing unemployment and a terrifying dearth of hospital space, the University should follow in the footsteps of universities like Quinnipiac University, where dorms have been set aside to house those impacted by the coronavirus, particularly hospital workers self-quarantining.</span></p> <p><span><em>This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board.

{"title": "Trump and the Trolley Problem | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Often smuggled into modern introductory courses in normative ethics, the \u201ctrolley problem\u201d is an infamous thought experiment that originated in the <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/796133?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents\">writings</a> of philosopher Philippa R. Foot. A simple rundown \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 of the moral dilemma is as follows. Fatefully, you are the driver of a runaway tram that will strike and kill five people unless you redirect it onto another track where it will kill only one workman. Morally speaking, what ought you do?</span></p> <p><span>Another version of the trolley problem takes place in the surgery room. Imagine that you are a doctor who can kill a healthy patient to obtain his body parts and save several other patients from dying. Should you kill the healthy patient or spare him? What is the right answer, if any?</span></p> <p><span>The trolley problem and its variations concern problems of moral justification.

How ought we choose among a number of competing moral principles?</span></p> <p><span>In a recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KenTremendous/status/1242494707176845312\">tweet</a>, Michael H. Schur, the creator of the philosophical fantasy-comedy television series \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d wrote, \u201c[The global COVID-19 pandemic] is basically the Trolley Problem, and [President Donald J. Trump] is taking the worst possible approach.\u201d The global COVID-19 pandemic can be read as another variation of Foot\u2019s thought experiment. Involving <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/who-gets-hospital-bed/607807/\">trade-offs</a> and conflicting <a href=\"https://time.com/5800379/coronavirus-quarantine-morality/\">moral decisions</a>, the current COVID-19 situation reflects a worldwide triage problem on multiple fronts.</span></p> <p><span>In hospitals and care-centers, medical professionals confront hard questions concerning bioethics and distributive justice. Given the shortage of medical resources, what moral principles ought to be used to prioritize prospective patients? One interpretation of <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill-moral-political/\">act-utilitarianism</a> contends that saving the most number of lives is what makes an action morally right. However, strictly adhering to such a moral framework could leave a large number of patients unjustly precluded from medical care on the basis of arbitrary factors beyond control.</span></p> <p><span>Medical rationing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/us/coronavirus-covid-triage-rationing-ventilators.html\">mechanisms</a> in many states almost all lend preferential treatment to otherwise healthy people who are likely to fully recover. On the flip side, older people, individuals with mental and physical disabilities, and victims with chronic medical problems \u2014 all of whom are equally deserving of proper medical care \u2014 could be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/us/coronavirus-medical-rationing.html\">denied</a> adequate medical attention. The dilemma grows more thorns when also considering identity markers such as race and socioeconomic status, provided that many low-income people and people of color are unable to afford top-notch treatments on a regular basis to stay in good health.</span></p> <p><span>On the national level, a number of difficult questions concerning lockdown policy are at stake. Over 6.6 million Americans filed for <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/record-6-6-million-americans-filed-unemployment-last-week-n1174776\">unemployment</a> last week, a figure that is predicted to rise as nearly 90 percent of Americans have fallen under the shadow of lockdown orders.

{"title": "If You Want To Go Far, Go Together | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Daniel L. Leonard", "body": "<p><span>When I visited the Kennedy Space Center, I couldn\u2019t wait to see Launchpad 39A. From that exact spot in Florida, humans first broke free from the Earth\u2019s gravitational pull to visit our neighbor, the Moon. Besides the Apollo program, 39A <a href=\"https://www.space.com/35736-nasa-greatest-space-launches-from-pad-39a.html\">was used</a> as the launchpad for dozens of space shuttle missions. I believed that standing in such a historic location would make me feel closer to space without ever needing to leave Earth.</span></p> <p><span>So, I was shocked to find that Launchpad 39A had been <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/spacex-signs-20-year-lease-historic-launch-pad-39a-n81226\">leased</a> to SpaceX and completely remodeled. While nothing could erase the significance of the location itself, SpaceX\u2019s logo undermined the many groundbreaking NASA missions that had been conducted there. At risk of sounding melodramatic, it felt like something sacred had been violated.</span></p> <p><span>This experience speaks to a broader trend that has characterized modern space travel. For most of the 20th century, getting anything into space was only feasible for massive government agencies funded by billions of taxpayer dollars. But now, as the required technologies have gotten cheaper and corporations have gotten larger, private companies have been able to play a far more central role in spaceflight.</span></p> <p><span>Is this expansion of private control over space travel something we should worry about?</span></p> <p><span>Yes and no. For one thing, private companies are free from much of the \u201cred tape\u201d that is characteristic of government agencies, so they can often get things done quicker. To space enthusiasts who are disappointed by NASA\u2019s depressingly slow progress over the past 50 years, that speed can be exciting.</span></p> <p><span>But speed can also lead to recklessness. Without the oversight and accountability of a taxpayer-funded agency, private companies are able to brazenly move forward in the pursuit of profits without regard for the public good.</span></p> <p><span>Elon Musk has <a href=\"https://www-jstor-org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/stable/41857289?seq=16#metadata_info_tab_contents\">said</a> that the rocket business is \u201can extraordinarily difficult place to make money\u201d \u2014 he even <a href=\"https://www-jstor-org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/stable/41857289?seq=17#metadata_info_tab_contents\">warned</a> potential investors that \u201cmaximizing profitability is absolutely not something I care about [...] so don\u2019t complain later that I\u2019m not maximizing profitability.\u201d This sounds refreshing, at first. A private company that doesn\u2019t care about profits \u2014 how noble! But, if we believe Elon that making money through rockets is difficult, then private companies may have to cut corners just to stay afloat. And, in spaceflight, cutting corners can have deadly consequences.</span></p> <p><span>So, given the obvious shortcomings of private space companies, should we dream of a return to the era of government-led spaceflight?</span></p> <p><span>I think that would be a mistake. Yes, NASA does have stricter oversight, better safety parameters, and decades of experience. But it\u2019s also plagued by tremendous administrative issues.</span></p> <p><span>For one, NASA\u2019s budget as a percentage of federal spending has been in an <a href=\"https://www.lpi.usra.edu/exploration/multimedia/NASABudgetHistory.pdf\">overall decline</a> for decades, which has severely restricted its performance. But, occasionally, NASA\u2019s budget does increase. President Donald Trump\u2019s most recent budget proposal included a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131361/nasa-administration-president-trump-budget-request-25-billion-moon-artemis\">12 percent raise</a> to NASA\u2019s budget (and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/business/president-trump-budget-cuts.html\">massive cuts</a> to social welfare programs). It\u2019s certainly no coincidence that the Trump administration\u2019s mandate for NASA centers around a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/10/tech/nasa-budget-moon-landing-artemis-scn/index.html\">manned Moon mission</a> in 2024 \u2014 the last year of Trump\u2019s presidency, should he win re-election.</span></p> <p><span>This type of political gambit is not unique to Trump; <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/its-time-to-end-washington-rsquo-s-bad-habit-of-changing-nasa-rsquo-s-goals-in-midstream/\">historically</a>, each new administration has changed NASA\u2019s targets to align with the political goals of the person in power. This has caused NASA to operate on four or eight year intervals, constantly switching its focus to carry out the new mandate set by the president. This short-term thinking is a formula for disaster, given that space missions require decades of planning.</span></p> <p><span>So, when viewed separately, private spaceflight companies and public space agencies each have major shortcomings. But the path to successful spaceflight lies in collaboration.</span></p> <p><span>NASA can give private space companies what they desperately need: research on safety and efficiency, the massive infrastructure required to transport and launch rockets, and valuable oversight to make sure everything goes according to plan. NASA has been in the spaceflight game for decades, so newcomers like SpaceX and Blue Origin would be wise to learn from them.</span></p> <p><span>On the other side, private companies can innovate \u2014 and, since they have less bureaucracy, they can implement their ideas faster than an agency like NASA. In return for their contributions, they can receive massive government contracts, which they\u2019ll likely need to stay afloat.</span></p> <p><span>NASA has caught on to the fact that public-private cooperation is essential for the future of space exploration. Over the past decade, the Kennedy Space Center has <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/cabana-announces-new-initiatives-for-multi-user-spaceport\">transitioned</a> toward becoming a \u201cmulti-user spaceport\u201d that facilitates launches by numerous private companies. NASA\u2019s decision to lease Launchpad 39A to SpaceX was one step in that process.</span></p> <p><span>I shouldn\u2019t have judged that decision so quickly. Many of those involved in space travel often describe how they are thrilled to be part of the process of exploration \u2014 a process that will continue after they die. If you had asked Neil Armstrong, he probably would\u2019ve said that the worst-case scenario for a launchpad is for it to fall into disuse.</span></p> <p><span>So, I\u2019m ultimately glad that SpaceX is getting some use out of Launchpad 39A. I look forward to seeing what private companies and NASA can do together.</span></p> <p><span><em>Daniel L.

And so now I've met those people and I feel much more connected to them,\u201d said Broadway star and Hasty Pudding honoree Ben Platt at the Hasty Pudding\u2019s annual Man of the Year celebration.</span></p> <p><span>On Feb. 7, Platt was celebrated with a roast led by Hasty Pudding producers Natalie F. Needle \u201921 and Samantha J. Meade \u201921. The roast was followed by the premiere of the Hasty Pudding\u2019s 2020 musical production, \u201cMean Ghouls.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>During the roast, Platt was subjected to quips about his age and his affinity for playing \u201canxious weirdos\u201d in everything from television to film to the great white way. He was also challenged to a sing-off in defense of his honor with a rendition of Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cFeeling Good,\u201d then acted out the ending to the fifth book from the Harry Potter series, after he revealed that he had stolen the book from another Ben at summer camp.</span></p> <p><span>He was also asked to channel his character on Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Politician\u201d while defending the status of hot dogs.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think we should be leaning towards connection and togetherness\u2026 Therefore, a hot dog is a sandwich,\u201d he said, before ending his speech with a cry of \u201cAnyone but Trump 2020!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Once he completed the various tasks required of him, Platt received his honorary Pudding Pot.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m very honored to be on this list of men and women\u2026 and I\u2019m going to put beautiful candies in here, thank you,\u201d he said, donning a sparkly bra offered up by Pudding cast members.</span></p> <p><span>At a subsequent press conference, Platt spoke of the importance of forming deep connections with his cast members and of his love for theater.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think I really value the opportunity to keep pushing back and forth [between theater, film, music, and television] because it allows me to appreciate the things about the other mediums that I'm missing or that I'm not really getting involved in. But I think theatre will always be my home and what I'm most passionate about,\u201d Platt said. \u201cThat's always where I feel the most comfortable, the most myself.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>When asked about how his Jewish heritage affected the way he approached his work, Platt cited the ways in which he connects with his coworkers.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI would just say my inclination to turn every sort of cast into a family comes from my Jewish upbringing. I think because I was encouraged to share my feelings and thoughts and to open myself up to people I love,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I go into every experience looking to make that kind of a bond with everybody, whether that's a piece of theater or my cast on \u2018The Politician\u2019 or a film cast.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Platt ended the conference with a reflection on his time in the limelight and the importance of a good relationship with his family.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think it\u2019s very easy for you to kind of lose yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm really fortunate in that I have a really wonderful family that keeps me very close to the ground. I have a lot of nephews and siblings and parents who are very supportive and want to share these moments with me. I could really care less about any of this.

{"title": "The Good Fight Fought Wrong | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "The Crimson Editorial Board", "body": "<p><span>In one sense, the latest feud between two Harvard Law School professors is just more of the same: a Twitter war of no particular distinction. But in another sense, it seems to be a reminder that behind the all-too-high-and-mighty walls of the ivory tower we are by no means safe from an insidious form of contemporary political swordplay.</span></p> <p><span>Since Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/1/17/dershowitz-trump-impeachment-team/\">announced his decision to join</a> President Donald Trump\u2019s defense team for the 2020 United States Senate impeachment trial, Law School Professor Laurence H. Tribe \u201962 has engaged Dershowitz in a <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/7/dershowitz-tribe-feud/\">public, turned personal </a>war of verbiage over the merits of Dershowitz\u2019s arguments against impeaching Trump.</span></p> <p><span>While a lifelong Democrat, Dershowitz became one of Trump\u2019s most vocal intellectual defenders, arguing that the charges brought by the U.S. House of Representatives against Trump on the grounds of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress were not impeachable.  Part of this defense included providing speaking on the Senate floor against impeachment. On the other hand, Tribe has argued that Dershowitz reduced a legitimate constitutional proceeding to a matter of semantics, in addition to claiming that Derschwitz had become \u201ca bit of a publicity hog and a celebrity seeking fellow.\u201d Dershowitz has fired back with equally fiery language, calling Tribe \u201ca zealot and a partisan\u201d and alleging that he has attempted to silence him.</span></p> <p><span>This debacle takes place at a time when students at the Law School are questioning the roles and responsibilities of lawyers in our society. Last month, dozens of Law School students <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/1/17/paul-weiss-hls-protest/\">protested</a> a recruiting event held by corporate law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP, which has represented the oil and gas company ExxonMobil in ongoing climate change litigation. And, one year ago, Law Professor and former Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.\u2019s divisive defense of  Harvey Weinstein similarly drew <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/12/students-protest-sullivan-weinstein/\">protest</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/1/liang-i-applaud-sullivan/\">divided</a> campus <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/4/26/suh-me-too-winthrop/\">opinion</a>.</span></p> <p><span>As such, the disagreement between Dershowitz and Tribe must be viewed as but one of many arguments in the broader discourse of what good legal defense looks like, taking place on our campus and across the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>Dershowitz absolutely has the right to defend President Trump, both as a private citizen and trial lawyer. Over his high-profile criminal law career, Dershowitz has defended <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/2/15/dershowitz-case-wikileaks-new/\">Wikileaks</a>,<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1993/4/13/dershowitz-wages-media-war-for-tyson/\"> Mike Tyson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1994/6/29/dershowitz-hired-to-defend-simpson-plaw/\">O.J.

Moreover, where <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/1/editorial-sullivan-upholds-law-not-students/\">we</a> notably <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/7/editorial-sullivan-professional-priority-dilemma/\">argued</a> last year that Sullivan\u2019s obligations to the students of Winthrop House provided a conflict of professional interests in his representation of Weinstein, Dershowitz \u2014 as far as we can tell \u2014 lacks any such competing obligations.</span></p> <p><span>A functioning legal system should guarantee everyone equal protection under the law. Central to that principle is that every defendant, from the most underprivileged to the most controversial or unpopular, is entitled to legal representation. As heinous as some of the crimes the accused he defended were charged with, we believe it has been within his rights and the dignity of his profession to do so.</span></p> <p><span>That said, we recognize that professors and more generally members of the Harvard community will disagree on matters of contemporary politics and legal matters. We encourage this disagreement of opinion, including on the topic of impeachment, believing that disagreement can engender critical and mutually beneficial discourse.</span></p> <p><span>Still, we wish this discourse remained firmly centered on the ideas at stake and did not devolve into ad hominem attacks. Dershowitz has invited Tribe to take their squabble off Twitter and instead hold an \u201cacademic\u201d debate about the matter. Such a debate, if opened up for the public to hear, could provide fodder for robust discourse among legal scholars, students, and the general public about one of the most important constitutional and political matters of our generation. In doing so, Dershowitz and Tribe would have the chance to demonstrate what healthy academic disagreement looks like. As it stands, however, their juvenile jabs and attempts at character assassination only perpetuate the clickbaity fueding that now mires the national public sphere.</span></p> <p><span><em>This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board.

Kurilla", "body": "<p><span>Roughly two years since his appointment, University President Lawrence S. Bacow has sought to engage with students, alumni, and political leaders in his extensive international and national travels.</span></p> <p><span>Bacow has not shied away from discussing national issues such as immigration and the role of higher education in the world during his trips, as well as student protests surrounding <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/14/divest-uhall-february-protest/\">divestment activism</a> and the development of an <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/2/11/ethnic-studies-rally-alumni-conference/\">ethnic studies department</a> at the school.</span></p> <p><span>In late January, Bacow traveled to the United Kingdom to deliver Emmanuel College\u2019s annual Gomes Lecture at the University of Cambridge. During his speech, Bacow discussed immigration and its impact on higher education. He noted that John Harvard \u2014 a colonial minister from the United Kingdom and namesake of the university \u2014 immigrated to the United States.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhat was once a strong commitment to academic exchange is being eroded by a visa and immigration process that often treats international students and international scholars with scrutiny and suspicion, if not outright disdain and distrust,\u201d Bacow said. \u201cAs a result of the disruptions and delays, talented women and men from around the world are reconsidering their decisions to join our college and university communities.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bacow added that he believes national immigration policies can \u201cundercut\u201d the strength of academic institutions.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNow, let me be clear, national security is a legitimate concern, but I believe we must be wary of policy that undercuts the strength of the very institutions that make coming to the United States worthwhile,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>In July, Bacow penned a <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/7/17/bacow-letter-immigration-pompeo/\">letter</a> to U.S. Secretary of State Michael R.

McAleenan to share \u201cdeep concern\u201d over immigration policies under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.</span></p> <p><span>Bacow made headlines following his first foreign trip as Harvard\u2019s president to China and Japan last March. He met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and delivered a speech at the country\u2019s elite Peking University as part of his high-profile visit to the country.</span></p> <p><span>The state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Bacow said Harvard will continue promoting exchanges and cooperation with Chinese educational and scientific research institutions during his meeting with the President. The agency also reported that Bacow said he came as a representative of U.S. universities to promote educational exchanges with China.</span></p> <p><span>Former University President Drew G. Faust also <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/3/17/faust-visits-chinese-president/\">met</a> with Xi on a 2015 visit to Tsinghua University.</span></p> <p><span>In recent years, China has faced criticism that the Uighurs, a Muslim minority group living in Western China, experience detention and surveillance at the hands of the Chinese government \u2014 allegations the country denies. Bacow\u2019s speech at Peking University made veiled reference to these issues.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is no wonder, then, that transformational thought and action often take root on university campuses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are places where individuals are encouraged both to listen and to speak, where the value of an idea is discussed and debated \u2014 not suppressed or silenced.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>To conclude his speech, Bacow read from Uighur poet Abdurehim \u00d6tk\u00fcr, calling him \u201cone of China\u2019s great modern poets.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bacow has also reconnected with alumni during foreign visits.

Last November, he also met with alumni on a trip to the inaugural International Leadership Workshop held by the Harvard Alumni Association in Amsterdam, Netherlands.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout his travels, Bacow also made references to protests in Cambridge \u2014 including calls for the divestment of <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/11/24/protesters-interrupt-the-game/\">Harvard\u2019s</a> <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/5/faculty-vote-support-divestment/\">endowment</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/4/5/protestors-interrupt-bacow-talk/\">fossil fuel industry</a> and the establishment of an Ethnic Studies department, and <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/3/grad-union-strikes/\">disputes</a> surrounding the contract negotiation for Harvard\u2019s graduate student union.</span></p> <p><span>During his speech at Emmanuel College in January, Bacow discussed the challenges universities faced when he was an undergraduate, recounting the 1969 occupation of Harvard\u2019s University Hall by anti-Vietnam protesters and the 1970 firebombing of Tufts.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOur students are organizing and protesting,\u201d Bacow said. \u201cThis time it\u2019s not about war. This time it\u2019s about climate change; it\u2019s about inequality; it\u2019s about sexual assault and harassment\u2014it\u2019s against a whole host of structures and systems that jeopardize the possibility of a future that they believe might be far more just.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He added that students\u2019 earnestness and passion remind him of his undergraduate years, but that he fears their ire would put the University \u201cin tension\u201d with their values.</span></p> <p><span>Bacow referenced ongoing student protest at Harvard in his March Peking University speech.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn many circumstances, my role as president is not to define the \u2018correct\u2019 position of the University but to keep the channels of discussion open,\u201d Bacow said. \u201cAnd one of the most important\u2014and most difficult\u2014of our tasks is to ensure that all members of the community feel empowered to speak their minds.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Michelle G.

{"title": "Kennedy, Markey Debate for the First Time | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Jasper G. Goodman", "body": "<p><span>In the first debate between incumbent United States Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.), few major substantive differences emerged between the two candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy criticized Markey for past foreign policy votes and over campaign finance issues, but he declined to attack the incumbent harshly, and instead called him a \u201cgood senator\u201d who has \u201cmade an important contribution to our commonwealth and our country.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In the debate, hosted by WGBH News, Markey stressed his experience and touted legislative accomplishments on policies involving gun control, climate change, and Alzheimer's disease research. He has served in the U.S. Senate since 2013.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOn the big issues of today \u2014 the challenges of today \u2014 I\u2019ve not only been leading, but I\u2019ve been delivering with legislation which passes, which protects the people of Massachusetts and the whole country,\u201d Markey said.</span></p> <p><span>Markey also trumpeted his introduction of the Green New Deal \u2014 a resolution aimed at curbing carbon emissions \u2014 with freshman U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Green New Deal, since we introduced it \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and I \u2014 just one year ago, it\u2019s transformed the debate on this issue,\u201d Markey said.</span></p> <p><span>The two candidates sparred over campaign finance during the hour-long debate. Kennedy, a 2009 graduate of Harvard Law School, threw barbs at Markey for declining to comply with the People\u2019s Pledge, which aims to limit outside money in politics, in this election. Markey signed onto the pledge back in 2013.</span></p> <p><span>Markey argued that candidates \u201cshould not silence\u201d progressive groups. He has released an alternative to the People\u2019s Pledge that barrs negative advertising funded by outside organizations but still allows for third-party spending.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHow are you ever going to pass a Green New Deal if you allow the fossil fuel industry to open up the spigot and flood the airwaves with scare tactics?\u201d Kennedy retorted.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy also drew a distinction between himself and Markey on foreign policy issues. He criticized Markey for his 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq War and his 2013 \u201cpresent\u201d vote on a resolution to authorize military force in Syria.</span></p> <p><span>Markey said that the administration of former President George W. Bush \u201clied\u201d about the presence of nuclear weapons in Iraq.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt was a false pretense to start a war,\u201d Markey said. \u201cI\u2019m still angry about the lie to the American people. I regret that vote. It was a mistake.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Markey said that he voted \u201cpresent\u201d in committee on the 2013 Syria authorization due to a \u201crush to judgement\u201d and a lack of information.</span></p> <p><span>To defend his foreign policy record, Markey touted endorsements from several peace groups, including Peace Action and the Council for a Livable World.</span></p> <p><span>The two candidates articulated similar views on many of the debate topics. They both posited their support for similar immigration reforms and Medicare-for-all. Both also chastised President Donald J. Trump for decisions he has made in office and called for Attorney General William P. Barr to be impeached.</span></p> <p><span>Barr has come under fire in recent weeks after he intervened to lessen the Department of Justice\u2019s sentencing recommendation for Trump associate Roger J. Stone Jr.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis president violates his oath of office to protect every single citizen literally on a daily basis,\u201d Kennedy said.</span></p> <p><span>Erin O\u2019Brien, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said Kennedy \u201cpunted\u201d on multiple opportunities to differentiate himself from Markey.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cMy main takeaway from the night is that Kennedy got two opportunities to say why he was better and different than Ed Markey \u2014 both in the opening question and in the closing \u2014 and both times he punted,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI think that was purposeful because people like both Ed Markey and Joe Kennedy, so Joe Kennedy doesn\u2019t want to activate anger.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBut ultimately, at least on the policy side, this is a race of what differentiates the two, and I don\u2019t think Kennedy did that tonight,\u201d she added.</span></p> <p><span>O\u2019Brien said she thought the debate was a \u201cdraw,\u201d but noted that Markey had a strong start to the evening when the discussion was focused on climate change.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe was able to dominate the first 15 minutes of discussion on an issue that he is recognized to be a real leader on,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking to reporters after the debate, Kennedy said he hopes to \u201cleverage\u201d the power of a Senate seat in a blue state better than Markey has over his time in office.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSenators from this state have traditionally been able to leverage that position to and the platform and the platform that comes with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we can get more out of this seat.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Jasper G.

{"title": "Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story: The Legacy of \u2018Hamilton\u2019 Five Years Later | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Sara Komatsu", "body": "<p><span>\u201cHamilton,\u201d the inimitable and original musical that exploded beyond the Broadway bubble and revolutionized both Broadway and American popular culture as we know it, turned five years old this year. In those years, the show has become one of the most discussed musicals of all time and it is still grossing millions of dollars a week. In light of its success, how do we account for its rise to the top \u2014 its incredible, unprecedented, meteoric popularity?</span></p> <p><span>Well, it truly was a revolution like nothing seen on the Broadway stage before: \u201cHamilton\u201d reanimated a familiar story about the ten-dollar founding father to be new, exciting, and modern. \u201cHamilton\u201d re-introduced hip-hop and R&amp;B to a Broadway stage, helping rejuvenate a traditional industry for a young, modern audience. The show is almost entirely sung through, meaning it is possible to experience the show through the soundtrack without missing key elements of the narrative \u2014 making it accessible to those who can\u2019t afford Broadway\u2019s sky-high ticket price.</span></p> <p><span>But it would be impossible to talk about \u201cHamilton\u201d without speaking about its creator, Lin Manuel Miranda. The massive success of \u201cHamilton\u201d conferred upon him the mantle of \u201cgenius,\u201d building a platform that he certainly does not take for granted \u2014 Miranda often utilizes his voice to mobilize people behind causes such as March for Our Lives or the recent earthquakes in Puerto Rico.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHamilton\u201d was not Miranda\u2019s first musical. In 2005, Miranda made his debut with the Tony Award-winning \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d a unique and electrifying blend of musical styles with Spanish influence. After these two major successes, there has been little indication that Miranda is writing a new show \u2014 instead, he has been working in television, film, and other Broadway shows. It is hard to blame him. To top the astronomical success of \u201cHamilton\u201d seems near impossible. Perhaps Miranda is destined to be an Orson Welles of Broadway \u2014 but as is evident from his near-virtuosic tweets, his genius is both undeniable and active. Whether he produces another musical or not, there is little doubt that any work he produces will be nothing short of brilliant.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHamilton\u201d\u2019s revolution was of more than just musical style. One of its most important contributions was putting people of color on Broadway, the \u201cGreat White Way.\u201d The sentiment behind the casting is to \u201ctake back\u201d the story of the founding of America. Having people of color representing a whitewashed history garnered wild attention and critical acclaim in the moment.</span></p> <p><span>Over time, however, the deluge of praise ebbed in favor of important observations about the musical\u2019s political status.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond the misstep of \u201cHamilton\u201d\u2019s erasure of slavery from its narrative, academic Patricia Herrera pointed to a possibly damaging consequence of the casting of people of color in the play. \u201cHamilton may also make it difficult for my daughter, and perhaps other youth, to differentiate Angelica Schuyler, the historical figure and slave owner, from Renee Elise Goldsberry, the African American actress personifying Angelica,\u201d Herrera wrote. Though the insistence on putting people of color on a stage that has historically excluded them is commendable, it may also cause issues by \u201cblurring these historical realities\u201d and potentially confuse young people\u2019s perceptions of history.</span></p> <p><span>In light of this, it is possible that \u201cHamilton\u201d may go the way of \u201cSouth Pacific,\u201d the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical praised for its progressiveness in 1950 but now widely recognized as having failed to break out of the confines of racist thinking. Ironically, Hamilton quotes South Pacific in \u201cMy Shot,\u201d where Burr says \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be carefully taught\u201d in reference to a problematic song by that name in \u201cSouth Pacific.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>So what will be the legacy of \u201cHamilton\u201d \u2014 who will tell its story?<br>\n<br>\r\n\u201cHamilton\u201d is an ingenious piece of work, a catalyst for great social dialogue, and has and likely will stand up to the test of time. Five years after its premiere, the musical is a foundational part of culture and dialogue. Recently, John Bolton\u2019s new memoir, highly anticipated for its importance to Trump\u2019s impeachment, was revealed to be titled \u201cThe Room Where It Happened\u201d \u2014 near-identical to the title of Burr\u2019s climactic song in \u201cHamilton.\u201d We may look back on it in 50 years with pride or we may cringe, but \u201cHamilton\u201d has undoubtedly earned its place among the giants of Broadway musicals in history \u2014 not as a moment, but as a movement.</span></p> <p><span>-Staff Writer Sara Komatsu can be reached at sara.komatsu@thecrimson.com</span></p>"}

He criticized \u201cself-described Republicans\u201d and \u201cpolitical opponents\u201d for giving his joke an offensive interpretation.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn our political climate, a few very loud people will attempt to exploit any possible misunderstanding for political advantage,\u201d Vermeule wrote. \u201cIf we allow these people to dominate public discussion and drive out free expression and political humor, however, we will all be worse off.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Kelsey J.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><em>John Della Volpe is the Director of Polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics whose research has focused on the public opinion of American youth since 2000. FM sat down with him to discuss the challenges that polling faces, its advantages for politicians, and the overall political sentiments of millennials today. This interview has been edited slightly for clarity and concision.</em></span></p> <p><span><strong>Fifteen Minutes:</strong> You\u2019ve now been leading polling initiatives at the IOP for about 20 years. How have the environment and people at the IOP affected the work that you do?</span></p> <p><span><strong>John Della Volpe:</strong> I think the only reason that the poll is respected is because of the unique collaboration that I have as a polling director with students every single semester. My job is to elevate the voice of young people; my job is to tap into the ideas and the attitudes and the hypotheses that they have about political engagement and to measure to the extent to which they\u2019re reflected in the broader population. Every year, there\u2019s a new group of young pollsters who are adding energy and passion and curiosity, so we\u2019re constantly updating and making the survey fresh. It\u2019s always reflecting not just young people, but the unique cohort of young people who are coming of age politically, in real time, in front of us.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM:</strong> When election results vary greatly from what polling suggested would happen, such as in the 2016 election, the validity and importance of polling can be questioned. When something like that happens, how can you assure the importance of polling? What steps should a pollster take to get more accurate results in the future?</span></p> <p><span><strong>JDV:</strong> The first thing is that national polling measures not the Electoral College, but the popular vote. So the polling averages across different kinds of data collection modes were incredibly accurate in 2016. However, clearly, there were important states in the Electoral College where the polling was off. And the industry conducted essentially an autopsy as a group to review data, understand why, and suggest improvements to modernize this process moving forward.</span></p> <p><span>The second thing is that we need to recognize, especially in primaries, that it\u2019s okay for people to change their mind. A poll that\u2019s conducted on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday is not designed to be predictive of an event that hasn\u2019t happened yet or that will happen five or six days from now. What we ask in the poll is, \u201cIf the election were held today, for whom would you vote?\u201d So we\u2019re not predicting what\u2019s going to happen in the future. I\u2019m confident that my colleagues throughout the industry understand the changes that are happening and have been making significant adjustments in order to make sure that the results that made people less confident about polling around the electoral college don\u2019t happen again in 2020.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM:</strong> People talk about the millennial vote and the generation overall as if it is one collective unit. From your experience, how homogeneous is the millennial vote really?</span></p> <p><span><strong>JDV:</strong> What\u2019s important to understand is that age and generation are two of the most divisive demographic groups in America today. The opinions and attitudes of millennials and Gen Zers \u2014 and the way in which they vote \u2014 is significantly different from their parents and grandparents. The divide between gender, and in some cases, the divide between race and ethnicity, is more narrow than the divides between generations. So we talk a lot about America being divided 50/50, but a better way to think about it would be that if you\u2019re under the age of 50, two-thirds of people vote one way, one third the other way. If you\u2019re over the age of 50, it\u2019s the opposite. So it\u2019s really a two thirds, one third country, not a 50/50 country.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM:</strong> How much of a role do you think that the youth vote will play in determining the winner of the 2020 election?</span></p> <p><span><strong>JDV:</strong> I think it\u2019s going to play a critical role \u2014 it already has. There is virtually no way that Bernie Sanders would be the frontrunner, even if he\u2019s a weakened frontrunner, if not for young people. So that\u2019s already showing the role that young people are playing. Because of the strong level of support for Sanders, we\u2019re having a conversation about Medicare for All and other elements of his agenda that we wouldn\u2019t be having without the support over now four years among young people. So in that regard, it already has. The candidate who challenges Sanders or wins the nomination won\u2019t have to win the entirety of the youth vote, but they have to be competitive. They have to be competitive. For a Democrat to win the Electoral College, he or she needs to win approximately 60 percent of the youth vote. Barack Obama did it twice. John Kerry and Hillary Clinton got 55 percent of that youth vote, and obviously we know what happened.</span></p> <p><span><strong>FM:</strong> Based on current polling, do you have a prediction for who will win the Democratic nomination?</span></p> <p><span><strong>JDV:</strong> No. And it\u2019s not the job of polling to make predictions for something that\u2019s many months away. We need to collect more data before we have any real understanding of the variables that are going to be at play. Having said that, I think younger people are reflective of the country as a whole, and that they truly seem torn between the Sanders approach to government and what you might call the Biden, Buttigieg, or Klobuchar approach to government.

{"title": "To Do No Harm | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>What separated the before from the after was an infection. Bacterial meningitis to be exact; an explosion of <em>E. coli</em> bacteria transported by arteries to the brain, inflaming his spinal cord and brain to the point of almost cutting off blood flow entirely, leaving neurosurgeon Eben Alexander III fighting for his life.</span></p> <p><span>On Nov. 10, 2008, a Monday, Alexander went into a coma for a week, with essentially no brain activity.</span></p> <p><span>Alexander claims he spent that time in heaven.</span></p> <p><span>Heaven, at first, didn\u2019t look so different from earth. Past the white light at the end of a tunnel, he saw a valley blushing with flowers, waterfalls tumbling into pools, revelers whirling arm in arm, and a girl flying on a giant butterfly. He says the chants of angel choirs made him aware of what he calls \u201cthe Core\u201d \u2014 an \u201cunending inky blackness filled to overflowing with the infinite healing power of the all-loving deity at the source.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Thus began Alexander\u2019s seven-day spiritual odyssey. On this journey, he says he traveled through different realms of heaven, learning the true nature of space, time, mass, energy, causality, meaning, and purpose.</span></p> <p><span>A week later, he opened his eyes in a hospital room.</span></p> <p><span>Alexander doesn\u2019t dispute that his brain had almost no activity during his coma; actually, it\u2019s one of the facts about his experience that he stresses most. He couldn\u2019t have been hallucinating, <em>because </em>his brain wasn\u2019t working. His apparent journey to the other side, he claims, is evidence that something about us \u2014 a soul, a consciousness, a spirit \u2014 is independent from our bodies: that we come from, and return to, the universe itself.</span></p> <p><span>This idea stands in direct opposition to materialism, the philosophical doctrine that everything, including our consciousness, is generated by the physical world. Materialism is the basis of modern science as we know it. Alexander, though, believes the spirit exists separately from matter.</span></p> <p><span>To Alexander, this conclusion is borne of logical reasoning, not of a disposition towards religiosity. He doesn\u2019t ask his followers to believe in what he says regardless of scientific evidence; he asks them to believe <em>because </em>of it.</span></p> <p><span>In Alexander\u2019s telling, his near-death experience changed his life. At the time, he was the clinical director of the Brain Program at the Focused Ultrasound Surgery Foundation in Charlottesville, Virginia. Today, his professional trajectory bears little resemblance to the more traditional medical career path he was on then. He has authored several best-selling books, appears on daytime television, and hosts public speaking engagements across the globe, all with the intention of spreading his philosophy to the world.</span></p> <p><span>But what separates Alexander from others with similar stories of the afterlife is his authority \u2014 by the time he had his near-death experience, he had been a neurosurgeon for more than 20 years, holding appointments at numerous prestigious medical schools, including Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Alexander is, for obvious reasons, a controversial figure in the medical world. Many professionals, perhaps most famously the late Oliver W. Sacks, have publicly disputed the medical claims in Alexander\u2019s account of his near-death experience. They attribute many aspects of his experience to tricks the brain plays when it\u2019s shutting down \u2014 for example, changes in blood pressure can produce what look like tunnels in one\u2019s vision and bursts of neurotransmitters can create the impression of bright lights. Others worry that he is peddling snake oil to the sick, using his story to sell false hope to a vulnerable population.</span></p> <p><span>But Alexander takes issue with the charge that encouraging the public to develop their spiritual lives makes him a quack. He envisions 1a type of medicine that is continuous with religion in its commitment to heal a patient\u2019s full self \u2014 both their body and their spirit.</span></p> <p><span>As a professor who spent more than a decade \u2014 1988-2001 \u2014 teaching at Harvard Medical School, Alexander is an admirer of the former Harvard psychologist and philosopher William James, whose work at the American Society for Psychical Research applied the tools of empiricism to questions of spirituality.</span></p> <p><span>In \u201cThe Will to Believe,\u201d a lecture delivered to Harvard students in 1896, James described a distinction between what he deemed a \u201clive hypothesis\u201d and a \u201cdead hypothesis.\u201d A live hypothesis refers to an idea that one is capable of believing \u2014 an idea, in other words, that can spark an \u201celectric connection\u201d with one\u2019s nature. A dead hypothesis, by contrast, cannot fit into a person\u2019s understanding of the world.</span></p> <p><span>For many, the claim that there exists an independent soul and afterlife is a dead hypothesis. But by redefining the spiritual in terms of science, Dr. Alexander is trying to resuscitate it.</span></p> <p><span>Eben Alexander grew up in the sixties in North Carolina; he was adopted by a family that boasts a long line of distinguished physicians, all also named Eben Alexander. His father, Eben Alexander, Jr., was a neurosurgeon who graduated from Harvard Medical School, where Alexander himself would eventually become a professor.</span></p> <p><span>Alexander received his undergraduate degree from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1975, graduated from Duke University School of Medicine in 1980, and completed his neurosurgical residency at Duke University Medical Center in 1987. The following year, he took up a joint appointment teaching at Harvard Medical School and practicing at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI absolutely adored my time at Harvard,\u201d Alexander says. He rebuts the assumption that HMS culture was scornful of spirituality, arguing that it was \u201ccertainly an advanced enough institution\u201d to permit free religious expression.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI will confess that it was not something that was really part of our teaching,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I were up there now, teaching residents and medical students, I would be more open-minded to the power of belief and the role of mind over matter, and the beautiful ways that we can truly manifest free will, in ways that I never was able to do back then, mainly due to my own limitations.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He characterizes his religious beliefs during his time at Harvard as somewhat agnostic; though he attended church, he thought that \u201cscience was the absolute pathway to truth.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But his doubt devolved into disbelief in 2000, when he tried to contact his birth family, whom he had never met. They didn\u2019t want to speak to him.</span></p> <p><span>He would find out years later that his birth family was still grieving the death of his biological younger sister, who had died two years earlier. They told him they didn\u2019t have the capacity to meet a new child as they mourned another. Still, the rejection stung. In the following months, he stopped going to church and stopped praying with his children. \u201cI kind of went through a dark night of the soul,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Alexander doesn\u2019t mention it to us, but the following year, in 2001, he was also terminated from his position at Brigham and Women\u2019s. In other interviews, he says that \u201cmedical politics\u201d forced him to leave. Alexander was also sued for medical malpractice the year before he left by a patient who claimed he failed to inform her a surgery she underwent might result in facial paralysis \u2014 which it did.</span></p> <p><span>Alexander moved on to UMass Memorial Medical Center, from which he resigned in 2003 after being suspended for alleged medical malpractice, the details of which have not been publicly disclosed.</span></p> <p><span>In 2006, he began to work at Lynchburg General Hospital in Lynchburg, Virginia. While working there, he faced another malpractice suit in April 2008, this time for fusing the wrong vertebrae together in a patient. The plaintiff alleged Alexander noticed soon after his error that he\u2019d made a mistake, but covered it up with a fraudulent operative report.</span></p> <p><span>Alexander challenges that narrative, however, claiming that though he had indeed operated on the wrong vertebrae \u2014 a mistake he admits \u2014 his patient had displayed positive results, causing him to reevaluate the \u201csurgical reasoning\u201d that had led him to target the intended vertebrae in the first place. He asserts that he changed the surgical note to reflect this \u2014 not as an attempted coverup \u2014 and his patient only chose to pursue a lawsuit after he offered to cover the costs of follow-up surgery. Though he was required to pay a fine and attend a weekend continuing medical education course on recordkeeping, he says all the investigations that followed the incident eventually exonerated him.</span></p> <p><span>Alexander brings to his defense a New England Journal of Medicine article that found neurosurgeons to be the medical speciality most at-risk for facing malpractice suits due to the treacherous situations with which they deal. \u201cI have never been found guilty of malpractice, but I have settled several cases brought against me,\u201d he writes in an emailed statement. \u201cSettlements are made to avoid the steep costs of litigation, not as any admission of guilt.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Still, when Dr. Alexander entered the coma that changed his life, he was being sued for nearly $3 million dollars.</span></p> <p><span>Given the havoc the <em>E. coli</em> wreaked on his brain, it is a miracle that Alexander is alive and speaking right now. When he was initially hospitalized for his coma, his doctors gave him a ten percent chance of survival. As his coma stretched on, they changed that to two percent. When, against the odds, he woke up, his doctors were confident that his brain would never fully recover. Yet it did. He places the odds of this somewhere between one in ten million and one in a billion.</span></p> <p><span>Doctors use the Glasgow Coma Scale to determine \u201cthe depth and duration of coma and impaired consciousness.\u201d The scale ranges from three to 15, where three is death and 15 is completely awake. Nine or below is a coma.</span></p> <p><span>During his coma, Alexander ranged between a five and a seven. In other words, he shouldn\u2019t have had any experience in his coma at all. But according to him, that\u2019s not what happened. When he recovered the ability, he wrote almost 20,000 words about his experience, which later became his first book, \u201cProof of Heaven.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>On the first day of his coma, he says he woke not in his hospital room, but \u201cin a primitive, coarse, unresponsive realm\u201d that had a \u201c\u2018scorched-earth\u2019 intensity\u201d \u2014 one that stripped him of all language, knowledge, or memory.</span></p> <p><span>He was delivered out of this desert by a \u201cslowing, spinning, clear white light\u201d into a glen he calls the \u201cGateway Valley.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe Gateway Valley was filled with many earth-like and spiritual features: vibrant and dynamic plant life, with flowers and buds blossoming richly and no signs of death or decay,\u201d he writes.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe chants and hymns thundering down from [the] angelic choirs provided yet another portal to higher realms, eventually ushering my awareness into the Core,\u201d he continues.</span></p> <p><span>After seven days in his coma, a boy, whom he later identified as his son, earnestly told him that he was needed back on earth, and he returned to the reality of his hospital room.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. Alexander claims that he wrote all of this down as soon as he was able, with little pre-existing knowledge about other narratives of near-death experiences. He says that initially, he thought it had all been a hallucination, perhaps something superimposed by the mind as he returned to consciousness. In his own words, \u201cI was my own worst skeptic.\u201d It was only later, as he compared his experience to that of others that he noticed similarities. His secular worldview began to shift.</span></p> <p><span>But one aspect of his vision eventually convinced him to embrace the spiritual: the girl on the butterfly, who had guided him through heaven. He says he recognized her, four months later, in a photo from his birth family; she was his deceased younger sister.</span></p> <p><span>Alexander refutes any notion that he has been \u201cchosen\u201d. \u201cExperiences are always tailored to teach the individual soul. And it just so happens that sometimes a lesson [for an individual] is a lesson that is also valuable for the world at large,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>For almost a decade now, Alexander has been telling his story to a public audience. In 2012, he released his first book; he has since written two more, chronicling his experience in a coma and his outlook on life and death. He has appeared on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d, Oprah, and Goop, among others.</span></p> <p><span>He regularly gives talks to faith- and medical-based groups \u2014 often in popular vacation destinations, like Virginia Beach or the Bahamas. Currently, he runs workshops around the world, with titles like, \u201cBecoming More Whole \u2014 Retreat in the Bahamas,\u201d \u201cLiving in a Mindful Universe \u2014 Weekend Retreat,\u201d and \u201cDying With Purpose: Consciously Crossing to the Other Side \u2014 Webinar.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The \u201cBecoming More Whole\u201d event description, for example, promises patrons that they will harness \u201cadvanced brainwave entrainment technology produced by Sacred Acoustics to improve stress, anxiety, depression, addiction, and insomnia.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Hearing Alexander speak, you might be surprised by his politics.</span></p> <p><span>He inherited his light drawl, along with his name, from generations of Southern surgeons and scholars, and there seems to be an impulse to typecast Alexander as an evangelical conservative. His recount of his experience in the afterlife are similar to those of other evangelical Christians, and some of his media appearances echo conservative rhetoric as well \u2014 as an Esquire profile pointed out, he once appeared as a guest on Fox News to reassure viewers that the child victims of the Sandy Hook Massacre were being warmly welcomed in Heaven.</span></p> <p><span>But Alexander\u2019s belief system draws upon liberal politics in surprising ways. He supports transgender rights and individualized gender expression, an upshot of his belief that souls have no gender. He is appalled by our country\u2019s class divide, and he is not an admirer of Donald Trump.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI kind of chuckle when I think about what Trump has said in these last few days about Nancy Pelosi, who prays for him,\u201d Alexander says, referring to the then still-ongoing impeachment trial. \u201cHe has no idea what that means. He doesn't understand that the power of praying for your enemy is really a tremendous power.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In the same progressive spirit, Alexander asserts that the loving and creative source he encountered in Heaven \u2014 which he has named \u201cOm\u201d after the reverberating sound he heard in that realm \u2014 is too vast to be claimed by any one religion.</span></p> <p><span>For Alexander, orthodoxy obscures meaning. There is no Hell, he says. Rather, souls experience \u2014 and learn from \u2014 the pain they have wrought in the lives of others through reincarnation. This model asks people to conduct themselves with a strong sense of justice, lest their deeds be answered back upon them.</span></p> <p><span>Alexander\u2019s theology also fits into a larger worldview. He believes we are now living at \u201crock bottom,\u201d as disaster \u2014 in forms like climate change, income inequality, and increasing gun violence \u2014 looms. He also describes a pervasive sense of abandonment: the public abandoned by corporations, the middle class by the one percent, and people by their politicians.</span></p> <p><span>Abandonment should resonate with no one better than Alexander, whose birth parents gave him up. To adopt his worldview is, in a way, to be adopted by his God \u2014 a forgiving, loving, and obliging parent, as described by Alexander.</span></p> <p><span>So what\u2019s stopping people from signing on? The problem of science, mostly. For many of the liberal-minded, the tenets of empiricism are incompatible with a god. Alexander, however, prophetizes the coming of a second scientific revolution \u2014 one in which spirituality will explode into the mainstream of progressive, empirical thought.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBy 2028, no self-respecting, scientifically minded, well-read person on earth will doubt the reality of the afterlife and reincarnation based on the scientific evidence,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>For Alexander, the tool of revolution will be none other than the fledgling field of quantum mechanics \u2014 an elusive discipline about which the physicist Richard Feynman once quipped, \u201cIf someone tells you they understand quantum mechanics, then all you\u2019ve learned is that you\u2019ve met a liar.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Alexander cites quantum entanglement, or what Einstein called \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d \u2014 a phenomenon in which two particles separated by huge swaths of distance continue to influence each other \u2014 as evidence for the metaphysical realm in which consciousness ultimately resides.</span></p> <p><span>Dr. Alexander isn\u2019t the first person to have had a near-death experience; people have recorded similar instances since humans invented written language. Alexander takes this as further evidence for his theory.</span></p> <p><span>However, many scientists believe the exact opposite \u2014 that the frequency and reproducibility of these experiences show that the brain is wired in ways that can trick us into believing that we are coming into contact with the supernatural.</span></p> <p><span>In a 2012 article in The Atlantic, \u201cSeeing God in the Third Millennium,\u201d the late physician and author Oliver Sacks explains that the \u201cbright light at the end of a tunnel,\u201d almost universal in near-death experiences, is a \u201cconstriction of the visual fields due to compromised blood pressure in the eyes.\u201d The light, meanwhile, is caused by \u201ca flow of visual excitation from the brainstem\u2026 to the visual cortex.\u201d He attributes the rest of Alexander\u2019s experience to a standard hallucination.</span></p> <p><span>Our perception of time, as Sacks points out, is not the same as the actual passage of time; Alexander\u2019s experience, which he describes as being years long, could have easily taken place over the span of a few seconds \u2014 namely, when his neocortex (the part of the brain that produces hallucinations) was recovering function.</span></p> <p><span>Alexander is aware of Sack\u2019s skepticism, as well as that of his other detractors. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even read the book,\u201d he says. If Sacks had taken the time to read \u201cProof of Heaven\u201d and his medical report, Alexander claims, Sacks would \u201ctear up his original article and throw it out.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>But the criticisms of Sacks and others have not dissuaded Alexander\u2019s followers, who fill conference halls and retreat centers to hear him speak.</span></p> <p><span>For many, hearing someone like Alexander recount his transcendent experience is faith-sustaining and affirming. For those who are suffering \u2014 perhaps those grappling with life-shattering situations like terminal illness or the death of a loved one \u2014 accounts like Alexander\u2019s are comforting.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe there are simply some phases of life that aren\u2019t adequately dealt with by scientific reality \u2014 regardless of what is actually true, there might be a place for alternative modes of belief inasmuch as they make the tragedies of life a little more bearable.</span></p> <p><span>Some suggest that Dr. Alexander is motivated by profit.</span></p> <p><span>Alexander strongly disputes these claims. He allows that he has benefited from the publication of his books; at the same time, he says that profit is an inevitable result of going with a mainstream publisher, which he had to use in order to effectively spread his message. He cites numerous free resources he has provided, from programs on his website to YouTube recordings of his lectures.</span></p> <p><span>Alexander is hardly the only evangelist who has had a near-death experience; the internet is filled with them. Maybe they\u2019re all cynical actors trying to get rich. Nevertheless, there are many others who believe the same thing happened to them, and have been much less public about it.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps profit is beside the point. Rather than investigating how Alexander\u2019s story benefits him, it seems relevant to ask how it affects others.</span></p> <p><span>The leading precept ingrained in medical school students is \u201cdo no harm.\u201d Martin A. Samuels, a neurologist who once worked with Alexander at Brigham and Women\u2019s hospital, applies this oath to the ethics of belief. \u201cYou can believe whatever you want, as long as you don't hurt people,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Tracy A. Balboni, an oncologist who helms Harvard Medical School\u2019s Initiative on Health, Religion, and Spirituality, says that spirituality can be a source of comfort and solace for many of her patients. \u201cIn medicine in general, but definitely in cancer care, I think we\u2019re faced with death and tragedy and suffering so often it\u2019s hard not to wonder about that reality,\u201d she says.</span></p> <p><span>Balboni is well versed in western medicine\u2019s rich \u201cspiritual heritage\u201d \u2014 albeit one largely obfuscated by an obsession with materialism. She explains that hospitals as we know them were \u201cbirthed\u201d in monasteries, and notes that the ubiquitous symbol of medicine is the Rod of Asclepius, the God of medicine in classical antiquity.</span></p> <p><span>And yet, she says that medical training is so focused on the technical aspects of care that some physicians might shut out patients\u2019 spiritual needs or experiences. \u201cI think there are definitely some that just feel like they can\u2019t go there \u2014 like that\u2019s not in their purview, and that they would be frankly uncomfortable,\u201d she explains.</span></p> <p><span>Balboni says that she recently lectured at a course offered jointly between HMS and the Divinity School, titled, \u201cSpirituality and Healing in Medicine.\u201d The class surveys how different religious traditions interface with the patient experience, and also teaches practical skills on how to take a patient\u2019s spiritual history and provide pastoral care.</span></p> <p><span>According to Balboni, the course\u2019s student body also boasts a large contingent from the School of Public Health. She cites a number of studies \u2014 including Harvard\u2019s Nurses\u2019 Health Study \u2014 which suggest that community religious engagement promotes group flourishing.</span></p> <p><span>Balboni mentions in our discussion on the continuity of spiritual and medical care that one of her patients, who had advanced metastatic cancer, gave her Alexander\u2019s \u201cProof of Heaven\u201d as a gift.</span></p> <p><span>Balboni says that reading Alexander\u2019s book struck in her patient the realization that he could choose whether or not to accept materialism, an idea which he had never thought to question. \u201cThere\u2019s an assumption that there\u2019s nothing more than what\u2019s around us \u2014 the material world that we can see, touch, and feel,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget that [materialism], in and of itself, is a form of belief and we can\u2019t prove that that\u2019s the case. We can\u2019t prove that\u2019s all we are.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the way to read Alexander\u2019s book, then, is not as a doctrine, or a commandment, but rather as a \u201clive hypothesis\u201d \u2014 one that empowers the sick and the scared with a choice to believe that something exists for them in the beyond.</span></p> <p><span>Shahram Khoshbin, a neurologist and Harvard professor in the medical humanities, expresses reservations about the utility of such stories. \u201cDogmatic religions,\u201d he says, \u201ccan be pernicious. Medicine, and ethical decisions around treatment, are so complicated that there is little room for modes of belief that are not fact-based.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>However, that doesn\u2019t mean that he thinks religion is useless. \u201cI would be damned if I walked up to any person and took away their hope,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the things about religions that I adore as a physician is that allows for hope.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>According to Alexander, there is no better example of hope manifesting in medicine than the placebo effect \u2014 a phenomenon in which a patient\u2019s condition improves simply because they believe in the power of a treatment, though it has no real therapeutic effect. Alexander also cites cases of spontaneous remission in patients with cancer, advanced infections, and congenital deformities.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA patient believed that they could get better,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd so what we find in medicine is this reality that mind can have a tremendous influence over matter.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps Alexander\u2019s philosophy could function as a sort of placebo. What doctor \u2014 sworn to the Hippocratic Oath \u2014 would tell their vastly improved patient that they had taken only a sugar pill?</span></p> <p><span>In \u201cThe Will To Believe\u201d \u2014 the 1896 lecture in which William James made the distinction between \u201clive\u201d and \u201cdead\u201d hypotheses \u2014 James concludes with the following: \u201cWe stand on a mountain pass in the midst of whirling snow and blinding mist, through which we get glimpses now and then of paths which may be deceptive. We do not certainly know whether there is any right one. What must we do?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>He answers, \u201cAct for the best, hope for the best, and take what comes\u2026 If death ends all, we cannot meet death better.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>And if Alexander is right, perhaps in meeting death, we also meet new life.</span></p> <p><span><strong><em>Correction: March 10, 2020</em></strong></span></p> <p><span><em>A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Eben Alexander recognized a woman he saw in a vision in his deceased younger sister in a photo years later.

{"title": "Sandel Debates The Future of Truth in Politics at IOP | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Kevin A. Simauchi", "body": "<p><span>Government professor Michael J. Sandel and Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center Fellow Gwyneth Williams spoke about the role of truth in politics to a crowd of more than 70 people at the Institute of Politics Thursday evening.</span></p> <p><span>Sandel and Williams defended \u201cpassionate public discourse in democratic societies\u201d but said more than facts are necessary for political discourse. Sandel said \u201cfact-checking alone\u201d would not be enough to combat the growing influence of political polarization and misinformation.</span></p> <p><span>Sandel attributed disagreement over facts to moral and ethical divides in society.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe don't agree on the basic facts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe disagree on the basic facts because we have a deep divide morally and ethically.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Facts, however, must be coordinated with a worldview to effectively convey arguments, according to Sandel. \u201cOnly when facts are connected to a view of the world that is connected to your political argument do they carry out,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Sandel also touched on the prevalence of false statements in national politics.

Bacow, have continued to lobby the White House and Congress on issues including immigration, student financial aid, and an excise tax on the University\u2019s $40.9 billion endowment.</span></p> <p><span>In recent months, Bacow has met with U.S. Senator Benjamin E. Sasse \u201994 (R-Neb.), U.S. Representative Jamie B. Raskin \u201983 (D-Md.), U.S. Representative Juan C. Vargas (D-Calif.,), and Representative Joshua K. Harder (D-Calif.), and U.S. Representative Bradley R. Byrne (R-Ala.), according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.</span></p> <p><span>Bacow frequently visits Washington to \u201cmake the case\u201d for Harvard\u2019s higher-education policy priorities, including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Temporary Protected Status programs, immigration, and research funding, according to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton.</span></p> <p><span>DACA is an Obama-era program that allows some young undocumented people to live and work in the United States; TPS is a program that grants immigrants from certain countries protected status because they cannot return home due to circumstances like ongoing armed conflict and environmental disaster.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cPresident Bacow is actively engaged with members and leaders when they visit campus, as well as through correspondence and telephone conversations,\u201d Newton wrote in an emailed statement. \u201cIn 2020, he has already traveled to DC once and likely will have other trips during the year.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In January, Bacow <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/20/bacow-travel-ban-trump-letter/\">penned a letter</a> to United States President Donald Trump urging him not to expand the controversial travel ban, a federal policy announced in early 2017 that restricted entry to the United States from several Muslim-majority countries.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard\u2019s lobbying efforts in 2019 saw wins on higher education-related tax legislation. Efforts to repeal the endowment tax \u2014 which is estimated to <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/25/harvard-annual-financial-report/\">cost</a> the University $37.7 million over the fiscal year 2019 \u2014 still remain a work-in-progress. <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/12/20/endowment-tax-passed/\">Passed</a> by a Republican-controlled legislative branch 2017, the tax would levy a 1.4 percent tax on net investment income for universities with large endowments.</span></p> <p><span>Bacow continues to call for a repeal of the \u201cunprecedented and damaging tax,\u201d according to Newton.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard is joined in these efforts by many of these schools and leading higher education associations, like AAU, ACE, and AICUM, as we work toward repeal of this tax,\u201d Newton wrote in an emailed statement.</span></p> <p><span>In 2019, the Office for Federal Relations successfully advocated for two tax changes in the \u201cConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2020.\u201d The act, signed into law last December, restored tax protections for scholarship grants and repealed a new tax on transportation benefits for nonprofits, according to Swain.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard administrators also continued to monitor changes to financial aid policies in 2019. Trump\u2019s Fiscal Year 2021 proposal requests $64 billion for the Department of Education, which is $7.1 billion less than the 2019 appropriation. The proposal also reduces Pell Grant funding by $2 billion.</span></p> <p><span>Of all undergraduates at the College, 16 percent of students receive Pell Grants as part of their financial aid packages, according to the University\u2019s website.</span></p> <p><span>Newton wrote in an email that the plan \u201cproposed steep cuts\u201d in non-Defense spending below \u201cpreviously approved bipartisan topline spending for FY21.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cLike many in higher education, Harvard is concerned that it would roll back many of the increases of recent years on education spending and research,\u201d Newton wrote. \u201cHowever, there remains bipartisan Congressional support for these priorities, and we continue to work for stronger funding outcomes in the final spending legislation.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Harvard is currently advocating for certain provisions within the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, federal legislation that governs student financial aid programs and grants to universities, according to Newton. These include expanded Pell Grants, stronger benefits for professional and graduate students, and language surrounding Harvard\u2019s policies on single-gender social organizations.</span></p> <p><span>Newton wrote that, beyond frequent travels to the nation\u2019s capital, Bacow also meets with civic leaders when they come to campus.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn addition, President Bacow is actively engaged with members and leaders when they visit campus, as well as through correspondence and telephone conversations,\u201d Newton wrote. \u201cIn 2020, he has already traveled to DC once and likely will have other trips during the year.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><strong><em>Correction: February 21, 2020</em></strong></span></p> <p><span><em>A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that U.S. Senator Benjamin E.

{"title": "Cocktail Party Politics | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\u201cHow \u2018bout that debate last night? Pretty crazy, huh?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Last week, the Las Vegas debate outperformed both the Grammys and the Golden Globes, becoming the most-watched Democratic primary debate ever. But I doubt that nearly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/business/media/democratic-debate-las-vegas.html\">20 million</a> people tuned in because they thought listening to Elizabeth Warren explain her universal child care plan would be more intellectually stimulating than an Ariana Grande performance. People got exactly what they came to see: some damn good entertainment.</span></p> <p><span>Take a look at the headlines after the debate: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/19/2020-democratic-debate-recap-highlights-from-nevada.html\">Elizabeth Warren came out swinging, and Mike Bloomberg was left battered</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elizabeth-warren-roasts-mike-bloomberg-las-vegas-debate-955318/\">Elizabeth Warren Roasts Mike Bloomberg in Rowdy Las Vegas Debate</a>.\u201d Clearly the Las Vegas setting was apt for the show; if you change the names in the articles it might sound like a recap of Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather. Now, many of these articles seem to be using sports language facetiously, but it's not an unreasonable way to describe the debate. NBC, the airing network, clearly wanted to evoke a sporting event; many of the questions were designed to conjure heated one-on-one matchups. Even the debate\u2019s introduction looked like something they would air before Sunday Night Football.</span></p> <p><span>The way many of us follow politics mirrors the way we follow sports. It's entertaining, even a little fun \u2014 cracking jokes about the opposition, laughing with your fellow supporters, diving into the details and statistics.</span></p> <p><span>There\u2019s an emptiness to much of our political culture \u2014 a hobby masquerading as civic engagement. Opinion pieces, cable news, podcasts, debates, what is the point? It\u2019s easy to have a bad relationship with politics. With so much information available, we can arm ourselves with an encyclopedia of useless political knowledge that is almost never applied to anything meaningful. As Tufts political science professor Eitan Hersh <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/10/804612601/passion-isnt-enough-the-rise-of-political-hobbyism-in-the-united-states\">said</a>, \u201cWhat they're actually doing is not participating themselves in any active way. They're really just following the news.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Political knowledge can often be nothing more than cocktail party fodder \u2014 a way to signal your sophistication and intellect. Dinner table punditry might make you look good; after all, knowing the demographic makeup of Ohio is sure to turn a few heads. But if impressing our friends is the culmination of our efforts, then we end up looking a bit silly.</span></p> <p><span>Many people do, however, go beyond the cocktail party and act in the real world, but not because they can predict how Ohio will vote. They might not know the details of how Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg differ on gun control, but they fought for a park in their town. They might not know who represents Florida\u2019s fifth congressional district, but they volunteer at the homeless shelter. We need to do more to commend these people for the impact they have.</span></p> <p><span>But I\u2019m not talking about these people; I\u2019m talking about the large portion that are hyper-invested and at the same time do so little. There\u2019s a subset of people \u2014 well-educated, probably liberal \u2014 whose knowledge goes far beyond being well informed into the unnecessary (you will find many right here on this campus).</span></p> <p><span>Now, I could have written this piece as a call to action. We certainly need more civic activity in local and state politics, and it would surely help the country depolarize, but I\u2019m not convinced that being politically attentive necessarily makes one more likely to act. Reading about politics on the internet is a lot easier than going out and accomplishing something tangible, so we cannot assume that the political junkie is one step away from civic action.</span></p> <p><span>I\u2019m not asking people to jump into local politics. Instead, I propose that some of us dial back the obsession with politics \u2014 to really reconsider the urge to consume so much politics.</span></p> <p><span>In 2018 the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/style/the-man-who-knew-too-little.html\">published</a> \u201cThe Man Who Knew Too Little,\u201d an article about Erik Hagerman, who in the aftermath of the 2016 election, \u201cswore that he would avoid learning about anything that happened to America after Nov. 8, 2016,\u201d and secluded himself in the woods to restore the land. He was met with strong criticism as people considered his vow to be another perk of rich white male privilege \u2014 he didn\u2019t have to pay attention because he wasn\u2019t under threat. However, Vox co-founder Ezra Klein notes, \u201cWere those of us sending angry missives into the ether really doing more than this guy who was restoring land to gift back to his neighbors?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Now, I\u2019m not advocating for sticking our heads in the sand. People obviously play a crucial role in representative democracy; if everyone acted like Hagerman, the government could run amok. In fact, I would still argue that far too many people in this country are under-informed and under-engaged. A <a href=\"https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/americans-are-poorly-informed-about-basic-constitutional-provisions?utm_source=news-release&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=2017_civics_survey&amp;utm_term=survey&amp;utm_source=Media&amp;utm_campaign=e5f213892a-Civics_survey_2017_2017_09_12&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_9e3d9bcd8a-e5f213892a-425997897\">poll</a> showed that almost 40 percent of Americans asked could not even name one right protected by the First Amendment.</span></p> <p><span>But we must keep in mind that political hobbyism is not civic virtue. Our country needs a well-informed electorate, but it\u2019s a representative democracy; we don\u2019t all need to roleplay as senators with an important vote in the morning.</span></p> <p><span><em>Daniel L.

{"title": "Not All Foreign Money Is Dirty Money | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "The Crimson Editorial Board", "body": "<p><span>Earlier this month, the United States Department of Education opened an <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/13/doe-investigation-foreign-governments/\">investigation</a> into Harvard\u2019s foreign funding, requesting information on gifts and contracts connected to various foreign governments, including China and Iran, as well as from a number of foreign companies. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/education-department-investigating-harvard-yale-over-foreign-funding-11581539042\">Harvard is not alone</a> in receiving this scrutiny; Yale, Georgetown University, Cornell University, and MIT are all part of the government\u2019s larger <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/11/6/nih-research-faculty-meeting/\">campaign</a> to crack down on \"academic espionage.\"</span></p> <p><span>Harvard has been roiled with funding scandals this year, from the <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/1/31/lieber-million-bail/\">arrest</a> of Chemistry Department Chair Charles M. Lieber for lying about Chinese funding sources to the exposure of the University\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/12/3/epstein-harvard-ties/\">ties</a> to Jeffrey Epstein. These situations raise deep concerns about the ethics and intentions of the people that fund our institution and are given access to it. In light of these recent events, we agree with the premise of the Department of Justice\u2019s probe: that Harvard\u2019s system to evaluate its funding sources is imperfect, and is in need of improvement.</span></p> <p><span>However, Harvard\u2019s relationship with the Department of Education must be understood in the context of the Department\u2019s broader backlash against institutions of higher learning. In her <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches/us-secretary-education-betsy-devos%E2%80%99-prepared-remarks-2017-conservative-political-action-conference\">2017 speech</a> at the Conservative Political Action Conference, current Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos made a point of specifying that \u201cthe fight against the educational establishment\u201d she has committed her Department to extends to colleges and universities. DeVos went on to condemn institutions of higher learning broadly, which she characterized as places where \u201cthe faculty, from adjunct professors to deans, tell you what to do, what to say, and more ominously, what to think.\u201d The Trump administration has also <a href=\"https://time.com/5600299/donald-trump-china-trade-war-students/\">already targeted Chinese students</a> at elite institutions of higher education, restricting student visas as part of a broad package of trade restrictions targeting Beijing. Because of developments such as this, we are cautious of fully embracing the Department of Education\u2019s inquiry, though we think the specific concern raised is valid in nature.</span></p> <p><span>The key issue regarding accepting financial contributions must be its impact on the academic work of our institution. Harvard should be open to accepting contributions from foreign governments so long as these contributions improve the quality of our institution. We do not believe that the foreignness of a funding source, in and of itself, should lead us to exclude donations. If Harvard receives money from a foreign government to study specific legitimate academic inquiries, we should welcome the contributions for the knowledge or good they will help produce.</span></p> <p><span>However, if the foreign government in question contributes in the hopes of propagating some self-serving political counter-narrative, or does so for some other overtly political purpose by leveraging Harvard\u2019s credibility, then the donation becomes problematic. Contributions for the purpose of whitewashing misdeeds and exerting influence must obviously be avoided.</span></p> <p><span>In short, intention is key. Harvard must keep its contributions clean to facilitate its ability to do rigorous academic work. But ruling out donations simply because they come from another country runs deeply counter to the international, open spirit we believe the University should champion.</span></p> <p><span><em>This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board.

In Massachusetts, 91 pledged delegates are up for grabs \u2014 the fifth most of the any of the 14 Super Tuesday states.</span></p> <p><span>Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor who has served in the Senate since 2012, has finished below 15 percent \u2014 the threshold to receive a delegate \u2014 in two of the three states that have voted. After receiving a bump in national polling following a strong debate performance last week, the Warren campaign is counting on Super Tuesday to rebound.</span></p> <p><span>Super Tuesday will also serve as an important test for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who struggled in <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/4/Iowa-caucus-results-delayed/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>the Iowa caucuses</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/12/sanders-wins-new-hampshire/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>the New Hampshire primary</u></a>, while providing an opportunity for former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P.M. Buttigieg \u201904.</span></p> <p><span>For the past several weeks, billionaire Michael R. Bloomberg has loomed large over the Democratic race as he has spent large sums of money and campaigned across the country \u2014 but has not appeared on the ballot in the states that have voted. Super Tuesday will serve as Bloomberg\u2019s effective debut.</span></p> <p><span>Warren has been mobilizing her campaign infrastructure in Massachusetts ahead of Super Tuesday, when Bay State voters will go to the polls along with 13 other states.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe feel like Senator Warren has had the most touchpoints with Massachusetts residents,\u201d State Representative Andres X. Vargas said. \u201cBeing the senator from here, folks have been able to get to know here better than anybody else.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Warren holds a number of high-profile Massachusetts endorsements, including state Attorney General Maura T. Healey \u201992. U.S. Representative Joseph P.

His campaign has been ramping up its ground game in the state since the New Hampshire primary by hosting events and recruiting organizers.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s a real distributed model of local captains bringing people together in their own neighborhood,\u201d Cambridge State Representative Mike Connolly, a Sanders supporter, said.</span></p> <p><span>Connolly attended a canvass kick-off event at Harvard\u2019s Dudley Co-op Saturday where roughly 10 volunteers turned out to knock on doors.</span></p> <p><span>Jason B. Kleban \u201911, a Sanders volunteer who trained canvassers before they went door-knocking Saturday, said the campaign focuses on encouraging casual supporters to become more involved and volunteer.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a real grassroots movement here,\u201d Kleban said. \u201cThe strategy is really just to activate as many people as possible to plug into the campaign, and not just commit to vote but to volunteer as well.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bennett \u201cBen\u201d Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, two longtime Sanders supporters who founded the popular Vermont ice cream company Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, held several events for Sanders over the weekend in Massachusetts. Climate change activist Varshini Prakash, a Boston native who co-founded the Sunrise Movement, also stumped for Sanders over the weekend.</span></p> <p><span>Sanders blew away the Democratic field in the Nevada caucuses over the weekend, receiving support from 47 percent of caucusgoers.</span></p> <p><span>Biden finished in a distant second place in Nevada.</span></p> <p><span>Biden is relying on several high-profile endorsements from Massachusetts politicians, as well as support from five of the state\u2019s labor unions to build his profile in the Bay State.</span></p> <p><span>The former vice president has the backing of former Secretary of State John Kerry, who represented Massachustts in the Senate from 1985 until 2013, as well as U.S. Rep. Seth W. Moulton \u201901 (D-Mass.) and U.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch (D-Mass.).</span></p> <p><span>\u201cCollectively, we\u2019ve got support throughout the Commonwealth,\u201d State Representative Brian M. Ashe, a Biden supporter, said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful if people are watching and paying attention that they know Joe Biden\u2019s the right choice.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Biden\u2019s path to the nomination has been complicated by the late entrance of Michael R. Bloomberg to the race. Bloomberg, a conservative Democrat who served as the mayor of New York for three terms, is out-spending his Demoratic rivals by a country mile.</span></p> <p><span>He has poured a staggering sum \u2014 more than $450 million \u2014 into his campaign so far.</span></p> <p><span>Bloomberg has focused his spending on Super Tuesday states in particular, where he has dropped $124 million on advertising alone. He has also centered on internet advertising and has spent nearly $42 million on Facebook ads.</span></p> <p><span>Ashe said he does not think Bloomberg presents a threat to Biden in Massachusetts, but cautioned that Democrats nationwide should take him seriously.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn Massachusetts, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll have much of an impact,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Biden\u2019s going to do very well here and I don\u2019t think Mike Bloomberg\u2019s going to take away from that here in the Commonwealth.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHowever, obviously [Bloomberg\u2019s] a big presence,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen you have that kind of money and that kind of personality, people are going to take notice.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bloomberg came under fire from Democratic rivals at last Tuesday\u2019s debate for his reported treatment of female employees, as well as for stop-and-frisk policing policies he enacted in New York that disproportionately affected African Americans.</span></p> <p><span>He has built a large campaign infrastructure in Massachusetts, now boasting six campaign offices and 60 full-time staff members in the state.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe biggest thing that we\u2019re working on is connecting folks with a candidate who hopped in 13 weeks ago,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Massachusetts state director, Jordan Overstreet, said in an interview with The Crimson Sunday. \u201cPeople see his TV ads, but I think it\u2019s been very helpful that they\u2019re also seeing people at their doors, too.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bloomberg\u2019s campaign held several events with surrogates around Massachusetts over the weekend. Academy Award-winning actor Michael Douglas and former Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis III, who serves as the campaign\u2019s state chair, stumped for Bloomberg in Lowell, Mass.</span></p> <p><span>Will Keyser, a longtime Massachusetts political operative who worked for Ted Kennedy and later as a strategist on Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker \u201979\u2019s Republican gubernatorial campaigns, serves as a senior advisor to Bloomberg\u2019s Massachusetts operation.</span></p> <p><span>Overstreet said the campaign plans to highlight Bloomberg\u2019s childhood growing up in Medford, Mass., to show that he is \u201cthe epitome of the American success story.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Senator Amy Klobuchar\u2019s (D-Minn.) daughter, Abigail Bessler, made a campaign stop in Harvard Square Sunday afternoon to speak at a canvass kickoff. Several Harvard students attended and knocked on doors for Klobuchar.</span></p> <p><span>Buttigieg has also been working to grow his presence in Massachusetts. The former president of the Harvard Institute of Politics Student Advisory Council named three state co-chairs last week.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s making sure that the strategy is focused on delegate pickup, which means no part of any Super Tuesday state is being left behind,\u201d Maria D.

{"title": "The Trump Bucket: The Perils of Being Conservative at Harvard | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As a non-liberal student on Harvard\u2019s campus, I\u2019ve always had an instinct to stay quiet about my beliefs. I could never pin down why, though. Sure, there is the sheer fact that only 10.3 percent of students in the class of 2023 consider themselves to be <a href=\"https://features.thecrimson.com/2019/freshman-survey/lifestyle/\">somewhat conservative</a> (while 2.1 percent call themselves very conservative). Overall, however, I\u2019ve usually been able to override my instinct to remain subdued.</span></p> <p><span>Recently, I was able to pin down a reason. While talking to a peer about her work with a conservative woman on campus \u2014 a moderate, at that \u2014 I asked her if she was conservative herself. She looked as though I had uncovered her deepest secret. Her eyes bulged and she stuttered. My first impression was that she was nervous to admit her conservatism; however, after reflecting, I\u2019m almost positive that her apprehension was due to the common association of conservatism with Trumpism at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>The fear of being associated with Trump and the current Republican Party stifles conversations between liberal and conservative students while simultaneously delegitimizing conservative students\u2019 beliefs. Going forward, both groups must take steps to create a productive, respectful dialogue. Moreover, liberals must correct their understanding of conservative views, and conservatives must overcome their fear of being labeled as supporters of a widely unpopular president among Harvard students.</span></p> <p><span>Liberal students must take steps to differentiate Trumpism from conservatism. While some conservative students do support the president, my bet is that most on this campus do not (though if they do, their reasons for doing so may be surprising and acceptable to liberals upon open dialogue). Here is why: The president does not govern conservatively. The Trump administration has \u201chijacked\u201d a traditionally conservative party and imposed on it a mix of populist assertions. As the GOP undergoes an identity crisis, a huge contingent of the party is finding itself politically displaced.</span></p> <p><span>There are a few key distinctions between today\u2019s party and the current administration. Conservatism does not entail an overall rejection of change, but is a moderated and controlled attitude towards change that asserts that when the government tries to resolve one issue, it usually creates more. Yet while many conservatives celebrate free trade, little government involvement, and consequently less spending, this administration has pursued heightened protectionism and huge amounts of government spending and expansion. Of course, it is hard to define conservatives as a whole over space and time, but what I can say with confidence is that just ten years ago, the Trump platform would not have survived a Republican primary.</span></p> <p><span>With a better understanding of general conservative principles, liberal students may start to see conservatism as a distinct political philosophy and differentiate it from the surge of populism that they so harshly condemn. In the same vein, liberal students should also consider engaging Trump supporters in conversation to understand their standpoints \u2014 some of which will certainly be reasonable. In this way, they can leave the echo chambers that condemn and misconstrue the conservative ideology. Understanding leads to the type of dialogue that can heal the divides between ideologically opposed students on this campus.</span></p> <p><span>While liberal students need to educate themselves and open the dialogue to all views, conservatives need to step up and stand by their opinions. Only then can they destigmatize their beliefs on campus.</span></p> <p><span>Conservative students\u2019 fear is understandable, however. The automatic association between President Trump and conservatism is not just deeply flawed, but it can even be dangerous for non-liberal students. The President is broadly perceived as an unintelligent, even malicious, individual in most circles on this campus. Take a moment and think about what your reaction would be if you were falsely accused of voting for President Trump and thus associated with those traits. Surely you would do everything in your power to dismiss the accusation. Perhaps you would avoid even bringing up topics that could lead to this conversation.</span></p> <p><span>But even if I, and other non-liberals, fear speaking up, we cannot afford to stay quiet if we hope to engage in comprehensive, inclusive conversations on campus. For instance, I have made it a point to engage my liberal friends in more political conversations. This is always an anxiety-inducing experience at the beginning. In a short amount of time, however, the majority of my peers are surprised by the legitimacy of my opinions and my lack of maliciousness and ignorance.</span></p> <p><span>Going into the 2020 elections, it is now more imperative than ever that liberal students overcome their false associations by listening with an open mind and educating themselves about actual conservatism. At the same time, conservative students also have a job to do: Instead of fearing what others think of them, they must clearly articulate their beliefs in order to distinguish themselves from the false caricatures that have become the defaults in so many of their peers\u2019 minds.</span></p> <p><span><em>Carine M.

Rosenbach, co-director of the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Belfer Center, Comey acknowledged that decisions he made in handling investigations into Trump and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton \u201churt the FBI.\u201d However, he insisted repeatedly during the discussion that he made the best possible choices given the situations he was in.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cDecisions that I made hurt the FBI \u2014 and that\u2019s important,\u201d Comey said in response to a question from Rosenbach about public trust in the Bureau. \u201cI still believe if I had chosen the other door, I would\u2019ve hurt the FBI worse. But there\u2019s no doubt, I knew we were spending the FBI\u2019s credibility.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Less than two weeks before Election Day 2016, Comey sent shockwaves through the political sphere when he reopened an investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she served as Secretary of State under then-President Barack Obama.</span></p> <p><span>Comey has also drawn criticism for publicly assailing Clinton as being \u201ccareless\u201d during a July 2016 press conference during which he announced the FBI would not recommend charges against her.</span></p> <p><span>Following her loss to Trump, Clinton publicly said Comey was a factor in her defeat.

Mueller III, who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, Comey assented.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf I had to do it over again in the benefit of hindsight, I would either not include any of the facts about obstruction or lay them all out and make the accusation,\u201d Comey said.</span></p> <p><span>He added that he also would have tried to \u201ccommunicate in a way that Americans consume information today,\u201d as opposed to a 448-page report, which Mueller released to the public last April.</span></p> <p><span>In his report, Mueller found 10 actions by Trump that could have constituted obstruction of justice, but he declined to make a determination as to whether or not Trump broke any laws.</span></p> <p><span>Rosenbach also asked Comey about academic espionage and brought up the controversy surrounding Harvard Chemistry Chair Charles M.

Jorrit de Jong, a Kennedy School professor, is the faculty director of the program.</span></p> <p><span>The program, started in 2017, has schooled some of the nation\u2019s most prominent mayors, including Chicago\u2019s Lori E. Lightfoot, Philadelphia\u2019s James F. Kenney, and Seattle, Wash.'s Jenny A.

Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg \u201904 \u2014 who took part in the program himself during its first year \u2014 received 10 public endorsements from program participants.

In the past, Bloomberg has hosted all 40 participating mayors in New York City for an orientation weekend in July.</span></p> <p><span>Albany, N.Y. Mayor Kathy M. Sheehan, a participant in the program\u2019s second class, said Bloomberg greeted them, joined them for dinner, and spoke at an orientation event.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe was very personable, very down to earth,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were substantive interactions about his experiences, as well as talking about the challenges of being a mayor, and sort of the personal side of his experiences as well.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Sheehan and other mayors lauded the yearlong education that followed. Sheehan said she took part in online courses and was paired with a \u201ccoach\u201d who checked in with her throughout the year.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe experience was really one that helped to empower both myself and my staff members to move forward on a number of initiatives that are really important to the city of Albany,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>Andr\u00e9 Sayegh, the mayor of Paterson, N.J., said the program was \u201cenlightening,\u201d and that it helped him to become more analytical.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNothing can properly prepare you for being a mayor,\u201d Sayegh said. \u201cThere\u2019s no real professional development course that you can take at a college, so this was like the equivalent of mayors university, and you receive professional development training.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Bloomberg, who is estimated to have a net worth of nearly $60 billion, has garnered the political support of more than 100 mayors in his 2020 campaign. Many of the mayors\u2019 cities have benefited from his philanthropic donations, which total nearly $9.5 billion since 1997.</span></p> <p><span>Davis, who endorsed Bloomberg in December, insisted that his ongoing participation in the Harvard City Leadership Initiative has \u201cnothing to do with\u201d his decision to support Bloomberg\u2019s candidacy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhether I had gone through Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative or not, Mike Bloomberg would still be my candidate of choice because of his body of work,\u201d he said.</span></p> <p><span>Other mayors said that participating in the initiative made them more aware of Bloomberg\u2019s political and philanthropic work.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it was a direct relation, but I will say that being part of the program allowed me to see Mike Bloomberg\u2019s leadership ability up close and personal \u2014 to be able to see the types of people that he surrounded himself with,\u201d Sheehan said.

{"title": "Inside the Conservative Media Outlet Feeding Harvard Students to Fox News | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When Christopher G. Colby \u201920 left Eliot House and climbed into the limousine that awaited him outside, not a single other person on Harvard\u2019s campus knew where he was going.</span></p> <p><span>Colby sat quietly in the backseat as the dimly-lit limousine made its way through downtown Boston\u2019s evening traffic.</span></p> <p><span>Soon, some 2.5 million Americans would hear his voice and see his face on Fox News.</span></p> <p><span>Dressed in a gray suit, Colby smiled tightly at the camera. An image of the Boston skyline glittered behind him and below him, a banner read \u201cHarvard sued over single sex-clubs.\u201d Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum announced, \u201cHere now, Christopher Colby, a senior at Harvard University, and a Campus Reform Correspondent.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Campus Reform is a media website operated by The Leadership Institute, a nonprofit that, in its own words, \u201cteaches conservatives of all ages how to succeed in politics, government, and the media.\u201d The Institute\u2019s top donors include the Charles Koch Foundation and the anonymous conservative groups Donors Capital Fund and Donors Trust. Billing itself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s leading site for college news,\u201d CampusReform.org employs college students \u2014 \u201cCampus Correspondents\u201d \u2014 to write articles about perceived \u2018liberal bias\u2019 on college campuses.</span></p> <p><span>Campus Reform also acts as a middleman that places college students on television networks like Fox News for short media segments \u2014 college students like Colby. According to Media Matters, in March 2018 alone, Fox News ran at least 53 segments about controversies on college campuses, 40 of which were previously reported by Campus Reform. 15 of those 40 segments either cited Campus Reform explicitly, or contained an appearance from a Campus Reform correspondent.</span></p> <p><span>When the limousine arrived at the television studio, Colby sat down, put his ear piece on, and stared at the wall. He was alone, far away from the main Fox studio in New York City.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s just you in a dark room,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHow oddly metaphorical.\u201d The dark room was a good metaphor, he explains, for the absence of political disagreement on Harvard\u2019s campus. At once, no one was listening and everyone was listening.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cUnfortunately, it led me to believe that I could just moonlight as a Fox News commentator, you know, without any repercussions,\u201d Colby says. \u201cI know nobody here watches Fox News,\u201d he explains. \u201cI was like, \u2018Nobody\u2019s ever going to find out about this.\u2019\u201d For Colby, the limo, the dark room, and the media segment were perhaps all just one big inside joke \u2014 with himself. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be kind of funny, you know?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The first two times he appeared on Fox, this proved true. It was a reasonable assumption \u2014 despite its massive size, the audience of Fox News has little overlap with the people on Harvard\u2019s campus. These two groups exist in separate information and media spheres, with little to no contact between them.</span></p> <p><span>But Campus Reform correspondents like Colby seem to have one foot in both worlds.</span></p> <p><span>Unbeknownst to most college students, groups like Campus Reform have for the past few years worked to craft an alternative reality about their campuses \u2014 an ecosystem that reaches directly through the gates of Harvard Yard. Campus Reform reports on many aspects of life at Harvard deemed normal by most students, including implicit bias training, Black commencement, and divestment activism.</span></p> <p><span>Another conservative group, Turning Point USA \u2014 a national campus organization founded in 2012 by conservative \u2018boy wonder\u2019 Charlie Kirk \u2014 publishes a \u201cProfessor Watchlist,\u201d a collection of \u201cspecific incidents and names of professors that advance a radical agenda in lecture halls.\u201d It is published in conjunction with Campus Reform, and its listings are often sourced solely from Campus Reform articles.</span></p> <p><span>In 2017, Danielle S. Allen, a prominent Harvard professor and director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, started receiving racist death threats over phone and email. It was only then that she realized her name had been published on the Professor Watchlist.</span></p> <p><span>If not for those messages, she likely never would have known about the alternative reality in which she had suddenly been cast a villain.</span></p> <p><span>In order to create this reality, media outlets need testimony from real college students. Campus Reform acts as a third party broker, bringing those college students from their campus realities to the living rooms of millions of Americans through a prolific media stream: articles shared widely online, and Fox News segments. The way Campus Reform functions, however, means that the narratives these students tell about their schools \u2014 the stories that shape the perceptions of millions of Americans \u2014 perhaps represent a reality distorted to confirm a pre-existing bias.</span></p> <p><span>Campus Reform correspondents described a preparation process that made their Fox News appearances closer to performances than journalistic reports: The ideas in the scene are determined before it is filmed. The questions students receive on Fox are crafted around the answers they have been prepared to give, rather than the other way around.</span></p> <p><span>Irena Briganti, executive vice president for corporate communications at Fox, and Caley Cronin, a Fox spokesperson, declined to comment on the record on how Fox and Campus Reform prepare Campus Correspondents for their media appearances. Cabot Phillips, the editor-in-chief of Campus Reform, and Jon Street, its managing editor, did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the same concerns.</span></p> <p><span>In print, Campus Reform correspondents are conditioned to pitch and write articles about an amorphous conception of <strong>\u2018</strong>liberal bias,\u2019 typically yielding stories centered largely around identity: race, sexuality, and immigration status. These articles are then widely proliferated on social media \u2014 but only within specific circles.</span></p> <p><span>Phillips and Street also did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Campus Reform\u2019s pitch selection process.</span></p> <p><span>Like a drumbeat, college conservatives report being marginalized and silenced on campus. Many say Campus Reform presents a unique opportunity for them to speak out. But given the largely distinct spheres of their campuses and the audiences Campus Reform targets, their articles and media appearances serve only to fortify the existing echo chamber among those who had bought into it from the start. Rather than speaking out, these students are speaking in \u2014 on behalf of larger conservative interests.</span></p> <p><span>Taken together, this system leads to a warped media narrative about college campuses in which the majority of students live in one reality, and a select few are deployed by a sprawling media empire to help create a divergent, parallel reality.</span></p> <p><span>When those two realities collide, rarely is it pretty.</span></p> <p><span>When Campus Reform found Arik C. Schneider, he never imagined his face would soon appear on Fox News.</span></p> <p><span>A Campus Reform correspondent interviewed Schneider for an article about an expansion of the University\u2019s \u201cDiversity Peer Leaders\u201d program when he was a sophomore at UCLA. Schneider considered the program a waste of Department of Education money and condemned it. In the article, he quips, \u201cOn the plus side, this shows Trump\u2019s administration is creating jobs.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A few days after the article was published, Schneider received an email from Campus Reform offering him a \u201cunique media experience.\u201d At first, Schneider assumed the organization wanted him to go on the radio. But as he emailed back-and-forth with Campus Reform over the next 24 hours, Schneider saw he had underestimated the group: The unique experience they meant was Fox News.</span></p> <p><span>Schneider would soon appear on Fox during a segment regarding \u201cUCLA Spending to Combat Social Injustices\u201d \u2014 the same topic on which he had voiced his opposition in the Campus Reform article.</span></p> <p><span>When Schneider was tapped to appear on Fox, the people who tapped him already knew his opinion on the subject.</span></p> <p><span>For Colby, this is an essential part of how the process works.</span></p> <p><span>In his case, a Harvard friend who was connected to Campus Reform \u2014 and who knew his politics \u2014 recommended him as a correspondent. As with Schneider, when Campus Reform reached out to Colby, it did so sure of his conservative bona fides.</span></p> <p><span>Soon after Colby agreed to discuss the lawsuit regarding Harvard\u2019s single-gender social organizations on Fox, he received a call meant to prepare and vet him for an appearance before an audience of three million.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s like a rehearsal, basically,\u201d Colby says.</span></p> <p><span>Colby and Schneider both explain that during the preparatory phone call, they went through the content of what they would say on air. Colby is unsure whether the people he spoke with on these phone calls were from Campus Reform, Fox, or both. Schneider says that he spoke with a person from Campus Reform.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI ended up being in a phone call with one of the senior staff members for about an hour as he went over talking points and such,\u201d Schneider recalls. \u201cRefining them so there\u2019s no verbal slip ups \u2014 just so I knew exactly what to say.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The preparation for Schneider\u2019s Fox appearance was atypical for someone meant to serve as a source in a piece of journalism: Rather than preparing for questions, Schneider prepared answers. \u201cI was able to write talking points, things I wanted them to talk about, and then from that, they then generated the questions,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me those ahead of time, but they mostly generated them in accordance with the talking points I submitted.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Colby describes a similar process. \u201cIt was like: \u2018Here are the talking points that we are pitching to the news network. And then the host will take those points and generate their own questions.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Emily M. Hall \u201918, who worked as a Campus Reform correspondent while an undergraduate at Harvard and continues to do so at Yale Law School, declined to comment on the preparation process for her six Fox appearances.</span></p> <p><span>Students work with the Campus Reform staff members to refine their talking points, chiseling them into punchy soundbites designed to present Fox News viewers a specific narrative of college campuses.</span></p> <p><span>By his third appearance on Fox News, which followed the divestment protest that took place amidst this year\u2019s Harvard-Yale game, Colby felt he had become an expert.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard-Yale protesters on their way back to Cambridge and Yale \u2014 on buses: Ooh, isn\u2019t that cool?\u201d he says, explaining his thought process. \u201c\u2018Don't you see how they\u2019re arguing against fossil fuels, but they\u2019re using fossil fuels?\u2019 This is catchy stuff \u2014 and they liked it,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Colby said something nearly identical when he appeared on Fox.</span></p> <p><span>Colby and Schneider\u2019s experiences demonstrate that Campus Reform works with the students to prepare for a journalistic report on Fox News that is in fact closer to theater \u2014 the segment shows a narrative that has been carefully vetted, rehearsed, and predetermined. Despite the appearance of a back-and-forth, both inquiry and rejoinder are in fact cut from a single block of stone.</span></p> <p><span>Briganti and Cronin declined to comment on behalf of Fox. Phillips and Street did not respond to multiple requests for comment on behalf of Campus Reform.</span></p> <p><span>Colby compares the process to car advertising: \u201cPeople don\u2019t sell car ads to networks to get them to buy cars,\u201d he reflects. \u201cThey sell car ads to networks in order for people that have bought cars to feel better about buying a car.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>During his first Fox appearance, Colby sat in the dark studio, a smile on his face as he strained to hear the anchor through a scratchy earpiece.</span></p> <p><span>Anchor Martha MacCallum went through the prompts about the University\u2019s sanctions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations. But then Colby heard a question unrelated to the answers he had prepared.</span></p> <p><span>MacCallum glanced towards her notes and then stared directly at the camera: \u201cNow, it\u2019s interesting because there are groups at Harvard that are ethnically-based,\u201d she said. \u201cDo those groups exclude people who are not of that ethnicity?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Colby remembers this, the final question of the segment, well: \u201cThey threw me this horrible race-bait question,\u201d he says. Colby says that he felt caught off guard. In the clip, he continues to smile and hesitates only slightly before answering.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cYou can\u2019t just be like, \u2018You\u2019re racist,\u2019 and hang up the phone \u2014 because that\u2019s not good dialogue,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you also can\u2019t just look at them and be like, \u2018Oh, I completely agree.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In the moment, he decided to settle on \u201cYeah, to a certain extent,\u201d and referenced a 2017 Campus Reform article written by Emily Hall about Harvard\u2019s first Black Commencement ceremony.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBlack graduate students at Harvard University are planning a first-of-its-kind graduation ceremony for black students,\u201d the article\u2019s teaser reads. \u201cThere is no \u2018White Graduation\u2019 scheduled, but Harvard will hold its third-annual \u2018Latinx Graduation Ceremony\u2019 the same day, and last month offered a \u2018Lavender Graduation\u2019 for LGBTQ students.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA very interesting battle,\u201d MacCallum says in the clip. \u201cChristopher Colby, thank you very much for coming on tonight \u2014 good to have you with us.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>In theory, Campus Reform correspondents are looking for articles that align with Campus Reform\u2019s amorphous mission of exposing \u2018liberal bias.\u2019</span></p> <p><span>In practice, sources reveal a pitch process that trains, conditions, and encourages Campus Reform correspondents to attune themselves to key words, topics, and trends that focus on political correctness and identity. Campus Reform correspondents must develop and hone their own sense of what \u2018stories\u2019 will please their editors \u2014 and their audiences.</span></p> <p><span>Natalie B.T. Le, a masters student at the Harvard Extension School, first encountered Campus Reform at a libertarian conference she attended as an undergraduate. She quickly applied to become a Campus Correspondent.</span></p> <p><span>Eventually, though, her relationship with Campus Reform soured. As Le got further into the organization, she grew less comfortable with their pitching and writing practices.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why I stopped writing for Campus Reform,\u201d she says.</span></p> <p><span>But for a year, Le published articles with Campus Reform while an undergraduate at College of Charleston and later at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen you get accepted, you get a call with [Campus Reform] to make sure everyone\u2019s on the same page,\u201d Le explains. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t want people to be confused, and then pitch the wrong things.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>To avoid this, Le explains, \u201cThey give you tips on how to find the stories.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As per Campus Reform\u2019s suggestion, Le set Google Alerts for \u201cFree Speech,\u201d and \u201cSocial Justice.\u201d From there, it was up to her to comb through the stream of results that poured into her inbox each day and select stories to pursue further.</span></p> <p><span>Schneider also published written articles for Campus Reform.</span></p> <p><span>After his first Fox News appearance, he said he was enamored. He wanted more, so he applied to become a Campus Reform Correspondent. In February, Schneider published an article in Campus Reform with the headline: \u201cHarvard group for \u2018anti-Zionist\u2019 Jewish students fights \u2018oppression,\u2019 like \u2018capitalism.\u2019\u201d Though he is a Campus Reform Correspondent at UCLA, Schneider\u2019s jurisdiction is not limited to any one school.</span></p> <p><span>He says he has two ways of coming up with pitches for Campus Reform.</span></p> <p><span>The first is rather tedious: About once a week, Schneider systematically scrolls through the homepages of different college newspaper websites \u2014 including The Harvard Crimson \u2014 and scans the headlines. He\u2019s looking for something specific, though sometimes, it can be hard to articulate what that is.</span></p> <p><span>The second is Google Alerts \u2014 the same strategy that Campus Reform taught Le.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI look for very specific search terms like \u2018College Protest,\u2019 \u2018College Israel, Palestine,\u2019 \u2018College Chinese,\u2019\u201d \u2014 Schneider pauses, and tries again. \u201cYou know, \u2018China,\u2019\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019m throwing a giant net into the ocean and seeing what happens.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA lot of it is just trial and error,\u201d he says. \u201cLearning how to separate the good stories from the bad, figuring out what they will and will not accept.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Internalizing those skills is lucrative, since Le reports that Campus Reform\u2019s compensation structure rewards the prolific. The group ranks Campus Correspondents by precious metals: Beginning as Bronze-level correspondents, Le explains, students can advance to the next level \u2014 first Silver, then Gold \u2014 by writing more articles.</span></p> <p><span>Le says that bronze-level correspondents are paid $50 per article, while gold-level correspondents \u2014 who attain their elite designation after publishing 15 articles \u2014 can receive up to $100 per piece.</span></p> <p><span>Eventually, though, Le realized that the subjects the outlet was interested in covering \u2014 specifically articles regarding transgender and gender non-binary people \u2014 conflicted with her values. As her reservations grew, Le began to distance herself from the group. Campus Reform emails would sit unread in her inbox. Le\u2019s articles remain on the website, but her author link redirects to a Campus Reform home page, her profile erased.</span></p> <p><span>After a year of writing articles, Le got a phone call. Campus Reform had an offer for her. It told her it wanted her to appear on Fox News to discuss the ongoing lawsuit challenging Harvard\u2019s race-conscious admissions policies, which some critics claim discriminate against Asian Americans.</span></p> <p><span>Le claims that Campus Reform wanted her to \u201csay certain things\u201d about Harvard and the lawsuit \u2014 things that she disagreed with, phrased in ways that made her uncomfortable. Le declined the appearance.</span></p> <p><span>Over the subsequent months, Campus Reform called Le on at least two additional occasions to ask her to appear on Fox News. Each time, she recalls, they wanted her to discuss the admissions lawsuit with specific, predetermined talking points, asking Le to paint Asian Americans like herself as victims of discrimination. Each time, she declined.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike with Schneider and Colby, Campus Reform and Fox\u2019s interest in Le had little to do with her willingness to promote specific talking points about a controversy \u2014 in fact, Le repeatedly expressed that she was uncomfortable with the script they suggested. Le had never been outspoken on the admissions lawsuit: It was her race, Le claims, and not her political views, that recommended her to Campus Reform for an appearance on Fox.</span></p> <p><span>Eventually, Le redirected Hannah Blair, her contact at Campus Reform, to Romil A. Sirohi \u201921, an acquaintance from the Harvard Republican Club. In a Facebook Messenger chat from Nov. 21 2017, Le introduces Sirohi to Blair and explains that he may be better suited than her to appear on Fox.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHi Romii! (sic)\u201d Blair writes. \u201cCan you tell me your overall thoughts on the story?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Before Sirohi responds, Blair sends two more texts in succession. \u201cI also believe that affirmative action should be based on socioeconomics rather than race.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhoops I\u2019m sorry I copied and pasted the wrong text,\u201d she explains. \u201cmeant to send this\u201d She sends a FOX opinion editorial with the headline: \u201cIs Harvard racist? If you\u2019re Asian-American, their admission policies just might be.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI oppose racial affirmative action,\u201d Sirohi replies. \u201cI support holistic admissions, including economic affirmative action.\u201d (Sirohi notes that his opinions on race-based affirmative action have changed since 2017; he now supports the practice.)</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThanks! I\u2019ll be in touch when I hear back from Fox,\u201d Blair writes back.</span></p> <p><span>Two hours pass before Sirohi types \u201cLmk.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Four hours after the initial text, Blair replies with Fox\u2019s answer. \u201cThey moved forward with another students (sic),\u201d she informs Sirohi. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it didnt work out!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Blair\u2019s messages suggest that Campus Reform cleared potential guests\u2019 opinions with Fox prior to their appearances on air.</span></p> <p><span>Blair could not be reached for comment on her exchange with Le and Sirohi. Briganti and Cronin declined to comment on this apparent practice on behalf of Fox. Phillips and Street did not respond to multiple requests for comment on behalf of Campus Reform.</span></p> <p><span>I ask Le why she believes Campus Reform was so persistent with her specifically \u2014 despite her saying no over and over again.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cOh, I was one of the few Asians,\u201d she says.</span></p> <p><span>The first two times Colby appeared on Fox News via Campus Reform, almost nobody at Harvard noticed. The third time, however, that changed. The world of Campus Reform and Fox crossed into his life at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>When Colby attended the Harvard-Yale game in New Haven this November, he watched as students stormed the field during half time to demand that Harvard and Yale divest their endowments from fossil fuels and Puerto Rican debt. The following Monday, he appeared on Fox News to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span>Fox and Friends airs at six a.m., so it was still early in the morning when Colby returned to campus after his appearance. Soon, strange messages began to appear on his phone and computer, texts and emails about his TV appearance hours earlier. The messages were from Harvard students, not the national audience of Fox viewers, and Colby knew many of them.</span></p> <p><span>For the first time, Colby\u2019s secret life as a Fox correspondent became widely known at Harvard. As the segment spread across campus via social media that morning, the two divergent realities collided.</span></p> <p><span>As he waited in line for lunch, Colby says he felt people staring at him. \u201cIt was like everybody knew me all of a sudden,\u201d he remembers. \u201cNot the good kind of know.\u201d From Colby\u2019s perspective, it seemed as if Harvard had turned against him.</span></p> <p><span>When people at Harvard got an insight into the parallel media sphere their classmates inhabited \u2014 and saw how Campus Reform, Fox News, and Colby himself were portraying Harvard, many were infuriated.</span></p> <p><span>That same day, Colby also received multiple texts from his contacts at Campus Reform asking if he would discuss the protest again on different segments airing throughout the afternoon and evening. He repeatedly turned them down: He had class, and he was exhausted and wary.</span></p> <p><span>Eventually, however, Colby agreed.</span></p> <p><span>He had made a calculation: Perhaps a second, more measured appearance could help him reclaim the narrative. \u201cSome of the things I said in the first one were pretty callous,\u201d he admits. \u201cI stand by what I said, but it was pretty brutal.\u201d He pauses. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help that you know, you have to smile the whole time.\u201d If Harvard saw a tamer version of his position, perhaps the campus would forgive him.</span></p> <p><span>Colby told the same story about Harvard on Fox News twice that day \u2014 but he attempted to address two very different audiences. In the morning, he performed for a national audience of Fox News viewers. In the evening, he spoke with Harvard\u2019s campus in mind.</span></p> <p><span>This time, he hadn\u2019t gone through the same preparation process with Campus Reform as he had for his previous three appearances on Fox. \u201cThere was no planning whatsoever for the second one,\u201d he recalls. He was permitted to come up with his own talking points, phrase things how he wished. Colby repeats the word \u201creasonable\u201d again and again.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt tells a different story,\u201d Colby explains. Without oversight from Campus Reform, he hoped to win back Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>When his two worlds collided, Colby faced a swift backlash.</span></p> <p><span>When Professor Danielle Allen emerged as a threat to the conservative agenda, she was vilified in the media sphere created by Fox, Campus Reform, and Professor Watch List. That world crossed into her own in the form of racist, sexist threats.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHey, you f*****g c**t, you. Professor Watchlist b***h,\u201d one anonymous voicemail said. As a barrage of similar messages poured into her email and Twitter accounts, the strange phrase \u201cProfessor Watchlist\u201d appeared repeatedly. This was how Allen found out she had been \u201cwatchlisted.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Launched in November 2016 by Charlie Kirk, \u201cProfessor Watchlist\u201d is a website run by Turning Point USA \u2014 whose mission is to \u201cexpose and document college professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.\u201d According to the TPUSA website, as of 2019 Charlie Kirk had appeared on Fox News, CNBC, and Fox Business News over 600 times.</span></p> <p><span>As of 2016, the site listed 143 professors by name. Campus Reform served as the singular source for 75 of those.</span></p> <p><span>Allen\u2019s listing on Professor Watchlist references an article she published in February 2016 as a Washington Post contributing columnist. In it, she cites Hannah Arendt and draws a parallel between the rise of Donald J. Trump and Adolf Hitler to illustrate, in her words, \u201chow a demagogic opportunist can exploit a divided country.\u201d That nuance was lost in the Professor Watchlist posting, which claims that \u201csaid that the rise of Donald Trump is just like the rise of Hitler.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>On the evening of April 1, 2017, Kirk appeared on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson\u2019s evening show on Fox News. Carlson begins by introducing Professor Watchlist, and together he and Kirk work through a list of professors they have deemed worthy of watchlisting, the names and photos of these academics flashing across the screen. Then Allen\u2019s face appears.</span></p> <p><span>Kirk and Carlson do not click past her profile \u2014 and with each second that her face flickers on the screen, each second that Kirk continues to rant about her Washington Post article, lamenting that \u201cShe teaches this in class,\u201d Allen\u2019s national profile among Fox viewers grows.</span></p> <p><span>Charlie Kirk could not be reached for comment.</span></p> <p><span>Allen was unaware that she had been pilloried on Fox, her name and face appearing on televisions across America. She remained unaware until the anonymous phone calls began.</span></p> <p><span>Something else must have happened, Allen reasoned, to prompt this new wave of negative attention. This was how she learned of the Carlson segment. \u201cOnce something\u2019s amplified on TV,\u201d she explains, \u201cit\u2019s just a different level than when things are only circulating as text on a newspaper or a website.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>As with the Professor Watchlist profile, Allen had unknowingly become a prominent villain in the alternative media narrative \u2014 only finding out through the pernicious consequences for her emotional and physical safety.</span></p> <p><span>Another voicemail said: \u201cYeah, yeah, Danielle. You\u2019re a lowlife f*****g n****r motherf*****g c**t, you know that? Saying what you say about Trump. You f*****g n****r b***h. F*****g scum. I hope he pisses on your grave some day. Ah, you\u2019ll outlive him but maybe his kid will piss on your f*****g grave and shit on it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Allen reported the voicemails to the Harvard University Police Department.</span></p> <p><span>Kirk\u2019s allegations on the Carlson segment are inaccurate \u2014 he claims repeatedly on Fox that Allen \u2018teaches this in class,\u2019 but Allen maintains that she does not. Neither Kirk nor Carlson offer any evidence to support the claim.</span></p> <p><span>Allen soon attempted to correct the record.</span></p> <p><span>On May 1, 2017, she wrote to Fox News to record a complaint about the segment, writing that her photo was broadcast next to inaccurate commentary about her by Kirk.</span></p> <p><span>On July 6, after two further inquiries from Allen, Tucker Carlson responded.</span></p> <p><span>In correspondences between Allen and Carlson, Carlson repeatedly asks Allen how he could have verified that she does not teach the comparison in class. In her replies, Allen holds that without any evidence or sources to support Kirk\u2019s claim, the burden of proof does not fall upon her.</span></p> <p><span>Carlson responds, \u201cI hear that a lot, unfortunately.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Briganti and Cronin declined to comment on Carlson\u2019s behalf.</span></p> <p><span>The second time Colby appeared on Fox to discuss the Harvard-Yale protests, he had also hoped to span the two spheres \u2014 to little avail. The \u201cmore reasonable\u201d segment seemed to fall on deaf ears at Harvard. \u201cI\u2019m sure nobody watched it,\u201d he says.</span></p> <p><span>Allen\u2019s attempt to bridge separate media spheres was equally unsuccessful. Carlson declined to apologize or correct the record, letting the unsubstantiated and contested claim stand.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAnd I have clarified my evaluation of your character,\u201d Allen wrote. They had no further correspondence.</span></p> <p><span><em>\u2014Magazine staff writer Malaika K. Tapper can be reached at malaika.tapper@thecrimson.com.

{"title": "End Bigotry Against Atheists at Harvard | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When Harvard Law Professor Adrian C. Vermeule \u201990 made a lame attempt at humor by <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/26/vermeule-tweet-backlash/\">tweeting</a> that principled conservatives would be \u201c[t]he very first group [headed] for the camps\u201d under a post-Trump liberal regime, critics condemned him for trivializing the Holocaust. They did so even though he did not mention the Holocaust and even though he might just as easily have had in mind the camps in which Japanese Americans were interned during World War II or those in which the People\u2019s Republic of China is confining the Uighurs today. A joker who comes anywhere near the Holocaust does so at his peril.</span></p> <p><span>But a few months earlier, when Vermeule took dead aim at atheists, the critics were silent. In defense of state laws that forbid atheists from holding public office or serving on juries, he tweeted that they are \u201csensible\u201d because atheists \u201ccan\u2019t be trusted to keep an oath.\u201d This wasn\u2019t an inadvertent insult, like his tweet about \u201ccamps\u201d may have been; Vermeule demeaned atheists intentionally. The critics were silent because bigots enjoy far greater freedom to slander atheists than any other minority group.</span></p> <p><span>If Vermeule had said the same thing about laws in Southern states depriving African Americans of the right to hold public office and to serve on juries, the uproar would have been deafening. Harvard students would have overrun the Law School and demanded his resignation. Had he targeted Muslims, gay individuals, or Hispanic immigrants, the reaction would have been the same. But even at a university whose students detest bigotry and discrimination, a faculty member who accuses atheists of immorality bears no greater risk of being condemned than one who speaks out against, say, abusive husbands and neglectful parents.</span></p> <p><span>Because bigotry against atheists is common and tolerated, most atheists refuse to describe themselves as such. When asked by polling organizations about their religious beliefs, about 4 percent of respondents say they are atheists. But a clever study conducted by researchers at the University of Kentucky found that people who do not believe in God comprise about <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550617707015\">26 percent</a> of the population. The researchers hypothesized that, because \u201creligious nonbelief is often heavily stigmatized, \u2026 many atheists [] refrain from outing themselves even in anonymous polls.\u201d Summarizing the results of a study published in 2016, one author <a href=\"https://sojo.net/articles/americans-still-distrust-atheists-and-muslims-reasons-why-are-changing\">described</a> atheists as the \u201cgroup Americans love to hate.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>It is all but certain that many Harvard students are closeted atheists. Atheists tend to be far more educated than those who are religious. According to a 2018 <a href=\"https://www.pewforum.org/2018/08/29/the-religious-typology/\">report</a> by the Pew Research Center, 45 percent of atheists and other \u201cSolidly Secular\u201d persons hold college degrees versus 14 percent of \u201cGod-and-Country Believers\u201d and 12 percent of the \u201cDiversely Devout.\u201d The student bodies at universities and other places of higher learning also contain mostly young people, and young people are far less likely to affiliate with churches than their elders. Yet, because atheism is stigmatized, many are reluctant to state their lack of faith openly and the influence of atheists is muted.</span></p> <p><span>Because atheists tend to be better educated than believers, Vermeule\u2019s attack on them is also a veiled broadside against education. His assertion that it is \u201csensible\u201d to preclude atheists from holding elected office and serving on juries further implies that less-educated people are better suited to public service. Why anyone would hold these opinions is a mystery; that a professor at one of the country\u2019s elite law schools does is horrifying.</span></p> <p><span>Vermeule\u2019s attack on atheists also implies that religious individuals can be trusted to uphold oaths. But if that is so, one must wonder how he can explain the ease with which Republican members of the United States House of Representatives and Senate ignored their oaths during the impeachment proceedings? The GOP is the party of religion. Republican officeholders typically wear their religious affiliations on their sleeves. Yet, instead of upholding the Constitution and judging President Donald Trump\u2019s culpability objectively, as their oaths required, they frustrated the investigation, rigged the process in his favor, and ignored the evidence entirely. When push came to shove, their religious beliefs gave them no moral courage. The only exception was Senator Mitt Romney, who was pummeled by Trump and Fox News for allowing his religious convictions to influence his vote. Oh, the irony.</span></p> <p><span>Vermeule\u2019s defense of state laws denying civil rights to atheists is religion-inspired bigotry, pure and simple. It\u2019s time to put people like him on notice that atheists are entitled to respect. I hope that members of the Harvard community will send him this message, loudly.</span></p> <p><span><em>Charles M. Silver is a Professor of Law at the University of Texas at Austin.

{"title": "Where Pop Culture Meets Politics | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Ellie M. Taylor", "body": "<p><span>That the line between celebrity and politician is blurred is nothing new. But this election cycle, the involvement of stars in the presidential race feels like a daily phenomenon, from endorsements and hot takes on Twitter to collaborations between celebrities and candidates. Jonathan Van Ness of \u201cQueer Eye\u201d fame has been campaigning for Senator Elizabeth Warren for months. Senator Bernie Sanders has hosted multiple concert-rally hybrids featuring artists like Bon Iver, Vampire Weekend, and The Strokes.</span></p> <p><span>Two endorsements from this past week are especially fascinating. Actor Dick Van Dyke joined the company of pop artists Cardi B and Ariana Grande in endorsing Sanders. Longtime Republican Clint Eastwood gave a surprisingly unsurprising endorsement of former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s campaign. These endorsements serve as interesting manifestations of the problems facing their respective campaigns, and the blending of public figures with public servants through celebrity endorsements demonstrates just how high-stakes and high-publicity this election is.</span></p> <p><span>Van Dyke\u2019s endorsement was an appeal to older voters to consider casting their ballots for a candidate who is often associated with energizing millennials and the burgeoning voting bloc of Generation Z. Among the various calls for unity in this election cycle, this endorsement stands out, calling for the transcendence of generational divides in the wake of \u201cOk Boomer.\u201d According to entrance polls from the Nevada caucus, the plurality of voters age 65 and older support former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, and Sanders\u2019 support wanes among older age groups.</span></p> <p><span>Eastwood\u2019s endorsement could be interpreted as an indication of the possibility of breaking partisan lines, but it would be more accurate to understand it as representative of Bloomberg\u2019s conservatism costumed as centrism. Eastwood has not exemplified stoic bipartisanship. Instead, he picked the closest candidate he could get to a Republican while distancing himself from the stench of a Trump endorsement in 2016.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the highly publicized nature of these endorsements, a celebrity\u2019s ability to change electoral outcomes is limited \u2014 <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/200180_crosstabs_HOLLYWOOD_Adults_v6_EM.pdf\">89 percent of over 2,000 survey</a> respondents said that there was not a celebrity that could influence their vote with their endorsement. The only causes that celebrities have a plausible chance of furthering through their political endorsements are their careers, name-recognition, and egos. So, how much damage could a celebrity endorsement actually do?</span></p> <p><span>Enough damage that it\u2019s worth discussing. The state of our politics has put Americans through the wringer. Bad news, scandals, and profound societal issues that face our communities, our country, and the world feel inescapable. For celebrities to insert themselves into the political spotlight is suffocating. There is a sickening irony in celebrities \u2014 often people with net worths placing them at the top tenth of the one percent of earners in the U.S. \u2014 endorsing candidates whose platforms discuss profound inequalities that are furthered by the ultra-rich while doing little to actively change their position in our society.</span></p> <p><span>Then again, a practically meaningless endorsement is far preferable to the direct influence certain famous figures have in our politics. Bill Gates\u2019 meddling in public education <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2242.html\">through funding charter schools and charter school advocacy groups</a> or the history of celebrities running for office, like Ronald Reagan, Al Franken, and even Donald Trump, are just a few examples of dangerous celebrity incursion into our national politics. While we face the inevitable slew of celebrity endorsements that will come in the next few months, it\u2019s important not to lose sight of how manipulative politics already are without the involvement of superstars.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Plurality of Surveyed Harvard Faculty Support Warren in Presidential Race | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Harvard\u2019s Faculty of Arts and Sciences strongly favor United States Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) over other 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, according to a survey of FAS faculty conducted by The Crimson.</span></p> <p><span>Forty-four percent of faculty members who took the survey said they back Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor. The tally is far higher than any other presidential hopeful. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) boasted the second-highest level of support among surveyed faculty at 20 percent.</span></p> <p><span>A mere three of the 260 respondents said they support President Donald J. Trump in his re-election campaign.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson distributed its faculty survey to more than 1,000 members of the FAS in late February, polling Harvard\u2019s flagship faculty on key University policy decisions, pressing issues on campus, and challenges they face as academics. Emeritus, tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure-track faculty all received the survey.</span></p> <p><span>The 74-question survey garnered nearly 500 responses, though not all respondents answered each question. The anonymous survey, a link to which was emailed to nearly every member of the FAS, was open from Feb. 20 to 27. The Crimson did not adjust the data for possible selection bias.</span></p> <p><span>As faculty <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/2/mass-super-tuesday/\">head to the polls today on Super Tuesday</a> alongside other Massachusetts voters, the first installment of The Crimson\u2019s 2020 faculty survey series explores the political beliefs of Harvard professors in a highly contentious and consequential election year.</span></p> <p><span>The survey closed before the Feb. 28 South Carolina primary, which former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. won handily. Businessman Tom Steyer, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg \u201904 and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) have dropped out of the race in the days since the survey closed.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond the top-line results, The Crimson\u2019s survey provided insight into the faculty\u2019s political views along a variety of demographic lines.</span></p> <p><span>According to the survey, Sanders is less popular among the top and bottom faculty income brackets. The longtime Vermont senator has support from just 9.7 percent of faculty members who earn north of $250,000 per year from the University. He holds the support of 9.1 percent of those who earn $40,000 per year or less from Harvard. He finds his strongest support among faculty members who earn between $41,000 and $65,000, with 37.8 percent of respondents in that income bracket expressing their support.</span></p> <p><span>Warren and Sanders received strong support among surveyed faculty aged 25 to 35, at 41 percent and 35 percent, respectively. Fifty-one percent of respondents aged 36 to 45 favored Warren, while Sanders came in second in that age bracket at 21 percent. Support for the pair of progressives waned among faculty over 65, with Warren at 38 percent and Sanders at a mere 8 percent. Buttigieg, meanwhile, placed second among the oldest age bracket, receiving 19 percent of respondents\u2019 support.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to indicating support for Warren on The Crimson\u2019s survey, FAS faculty also backed her with their wallets more than any other candidate in 2019, according to an analysis of Federal Elections Commission data conducted by The Crimson.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson cross-referenced all faculty members with FAS in their title in the Harvard Connections database with contributors who listed Harvard as their employer in 2019 FEC filings. According to that analysis, Warren received at least $19,666.59 from at least 28 Harvard faculty members. In 2019, Buttigieg \u2014 who dropped out of the Democratic race Sunday night \u2014 came in second with at least $7,091 in donations from FAS faculty.</span></p> <p><span>An overwhelming majority of faculty members who took the survey broadly characterized their political leanings as \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cvery liberal\u201d \u2014 forty-one percent of faculty responded they are \u201cliberal,\u201d and 38 percent said they are \u201cvery liberal.\u201d Just four professors identified themselves as \u201cconservative\u201d or \u201cvery conservative.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>A similar survey of the faculty in 2018 also <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/5/2/faculty-survey-part-2/\">found</a> that the vast majority of respondents identified as \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cvery liberal,\u201d and a similarly large majority reported that they voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.</span></p> <p><span>Despite indicating in large numbers that they planned to vote for Warren, faculty survey respondents were divided over which Democratic candidate they believe is most electable. The plurality of respondents, 30 percent, ranked Sanders as the \u201cmost likely to beat candidate President Donald Trump\u201d on a question which garnered 246 responses.</span></p> <p><span>A combined 53 percent of faculty believed one of the candidates on the left wing of the ideological spectrum \u2014 either Sanders or Warren \u2014 would be most likely to win in the general election. Former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who will appear on Democratic primary ballots for the first time Tuesday, ranked third on electability among surveyed faculty at 17 percent, followed by Biden at 11 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Opinions on electability also diverged along lines of age. Fifty-six percent of respondents aged 25 to 35 believed Sanders to be the most electable, while only 14 percent of respondents aged over 65 felt the same. A plurality of surveyed faculty over 65 believed Bloomberg to be the most electable, at 31 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Nationally, Democratic primary voters say electability is one of the most important factors in selecting a nominee to face Trump in the general election. Just four major candidates \u2014 Warren, Sanders, Biden, and Bloomberg \u2014 remain in the Democratic race ahead of <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/2/mass-super-tuesday/\">today\u2019s pivotal Super Tuesday contests</a>.</span></p> <p><span>For its 2020 Faculty Survey, The Crimson collected electronic responses through Qualtrics, an online survey platform, from Feb. 20 to 27, 2020. A link to the anonymous survey was sent to 1,341 FAS and SEAS faculty members through emails sourced in October 2019 from Harvard directory information. The pool included individuals on Harvard\u2019s Connections database with FAS titles, including emeritus, tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure-track faculty.</span></p> <p><span>Of those faculty, 476 accessed the link to the survey. A total of 416 participants answered at least one question, while 263 participants completed every question in the survey.</span></p> <p><span>To prevent participants from accidentally taking the survey more than once, The Crimson enabled Qualtrics\u2019 browser cookie functionality to register unique survey sessions on each device. This device data is controlled by Qualtrics, and The Crimson does not retain information that could identify devices accessing the survey with anonymous responses.</span></p> <p><span>In an effort to check for response bias, The Crimson compared respondent demographics with publicly available information on faculty demographics provided by the University \u2014 information regarding gender, minority background, SEAS affiliation, and ladder versus non-ladder status. Overall, respondent demographics tracked with faculty demographics.</span></p> <p><span>Of survey respondents, 41 percent identified themselves as women and 20 percent identified themselves as minorities. Based on data in the 2019 FAS Dean\u2019s Annual report, women and minorities make up 39 percent and 24 percent of FAS ladder faculty, respectively.</span></p> <p><span>According to the Dean\u2019s report, 41 percent of the FAS were non-ladder faculty \u2014 a term synonymous with non-tenure-track faculty. By contrast, 39 percent of respondents to The Crimson\u2019s survey identified themselves as non-ladder faculty.</span></p> <p><span>Of faculty who were sent the link to the survey, 127 \u2014 or 9 percent \u2014 are affiliated with SEAS. In comparison, of respondents who indicated their divisional affiliation on the survey, 7 percent reported an affiliation with SEAS.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer James S.

{"title": "A Case for Harvard\u2019s Own: Elizabeth Warren | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The 2020 Democratic candidate must have the temperament and platform that motivates every Democrat \u2014 not to mention their independent father \u2014 out to the polls. That candidate is Elizabeth Warren \u2014 and not just because she is an emerita professor at Harvard Law School.</span></p> <p><span>Two overarching questions face Democrats right now. The first question asks, \u201cWill Democrats win 2020 by appealing to the median voter, or will they win by mobilizing the Progressive flank?\u201d And the second question asks, \u201cIs Trump an aberration, or is he a symptom of the nation\u2019s deeper ailments?\u201d</span></p> <p><span>I am not the first to raise these questions \u2014 just go over to CGIS and you\u2019ll hear them debated ad nauseum. But as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/19/what-is-super-tuesday/?arc404=true\">Super Tuesday</a> approaches and many <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/26/early-voting-mass-primaries/\">Harvardians</a> gear up to vote in Massachusetts or mail ballots home, people outside the political punditry must fiercely interrogate these questions themselves. After all, how we answer them matters for how we answer the bigger question of who is best positioned to beat Donald Trump in November.</span></p> <p><span>If Democrats believe that galvanizing the progressive vote will carry them to victory in 2020 and that Trump is symptomatic of deeper issues, then the logical conclusion is to nominate Bernie Sanders. Conversely, if Democrats believe that victory rests with the median voter and that Trump was an aberration, then the logical conclusion is to put forward Joe Biden, Michael Bloomberg, or Amy Klobuchar\u2014 who can appeal to middle-of-the-road America.</span></p> <p><span>The answers to these two questions, however, are not so black and white. Looking at <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/08/24/545812242/1-in-10-sanders-primary-voters-ended-up-supporting-trump-survey-finds\">2016 voting</a>, for instance, it is noteworthy that 12 percent of Sanders's primary voters ultimately voted for Trump, which should be a cautionary tale about nominating a candidate with lackluster progressive credentials. Still another 12 percent of Republican primary voters (particularly supporters of John Kasich and Marco Rubio) cast their ballot for Hillary Clinton, indicating that the median voter is not \u201cdead\u201d as many progressives decry. It would therefore be dangerous to put forward either a progressive who risks alienating the median voter or a moderate who can\u2019t keep progressives in the fold.</span></p> <p><span>Let\u2019s instead nominate a candidate positioned to straddle the intraparty rift; who promises to usher in big, structural change while not going so far as to abandon America\u2019s core systems; who dreams big and fights hard; who refuses to hold her punches. Let\u2019s nominate Senator Elizabeth Warren.</span></p> <p><span>When it comes to envisioning a more equitable America, Warren is unparalleled. Her dizzyingly comprehensive <a href=\"https://elizabethwarren.com/plans\">agenda</a>, genuine sensitivity to issues of race, gender, and identity, and expansive interpretation of executive power qualify her as the best standard-bearer for the progressive cause, not Bernie.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike Sanders, Warren has spent the past 40 years studying the factors exacerbating inequality and degrading American mobility. Unlike Sanders, Warren has the record of creating a highly effective federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has returned $12.4 billion back to American households cheated by financial companies. And unlike Sanders, Warren has actually fulfilled her Senatorial duty and legislated \u2014 the primary sponsor on<a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/elizabeth_warren/412542\"> nine Senate bills</a>, compared to Sanders\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/bernard_sanders/400357\"> three</a>, and since 2013, a co-sponsor on<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/member/elizabeth-warren/W000817?searchResultViewType=expanded&amp;KWICView=false&amp;q=%7B%22congress%22%3A%22all%22%2C%22bill-status%22%3A%22law%22%7D\"> 50</a> laws, compared to Sanders\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/member/bernard-sanders/S000033?q=%7B%22congress%22%3A%5B%22113%22%2C%22114%22%2C%22115%22%2C%22116%22%5D%2C%22bill-status%22%3A%22law%22%7D\">17</a> over the same period. Warren is therefore the more qualified representative of the progressive cause, eager to pick up the fragmented pieces of the executive branch and better people\u2019s lives through the subtle yet seismic push-and-pull of regulatory levers.</span></p> <p><span>Warren would also handily maintain moderate\u2019s support.</span></p> <p><span>First, Warren\u2019s establishment support \u2014 proxied by endorsements \u2014 is surpassed only by Biden and Bloomberg, according to <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-endorsements/democratic-primary/#BernieSandershttp://FiveThirtyEight\">FiveThirtyEight</a>\u2019s analysis. And I would argue that merely analyzing Warren\u2019s endorsements from the likes of Edward Markey (D-Mass.), Julian Castro, Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) actually under-estimate her cache. After all, she was also a professor at Harvard Law School, where she taught current members of Congress, including Katie Porter (D-Calif.), and Kennedy, both of whom formally endorsed her, and she maintains strong ties to the Obama administration from her days building the CFPB and cleaning up after the Global Financial Crisis.</span></p> <p><span>Second, the mantelpieces for Warren\u2019s campaign \u2014 anti-corruption, reviving the American Dream for all, education, and labor rights \u2014 are broadly popular among the American electorate, which will motivate Moderates to embrace her platform given their belief in victory through broad appeal. In turn, down-ballot Democrats will be able to ride Warren\u2019s coattails with a laser-focus on not-so-sexy but oh-so-important policies.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, Warren elevates reform over revolution, channeling the legal and political traditions of Louis Brandeis, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, and Lyndon B. Johnson to inform her plans for a more equitable and just America. These three figures are demigods in Democratic lore, and Warren gives Democrats the chance to revive some of that transformational glory.</span></p> <p><span>Up until this point, the electability conversation has focused too much on individual candidates and too little on party unity. So, before we cast the last ballot, let\u2019s be straight with ourselves: Neither moderates nor progressives will win without each other, and neither moderates nor progressives can govern alone. There is only one candidate positioned to unify the party. That candidate is Senator Elizabeth Warren.</span></p> <p><span>Warren is ready to roll up the sleeves of her Nina McLemore blazer and fight like the dickens. Her persistence, her intellect, and her fierceness is Trump\u2019s worst nightmare. And it is the Democrats\u2019 best shot.</span></p> <p><span><em>Michael G.

In Massachusetts, which will award 91 pledged delegates, polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Cambridge boasts 34 polling locations, including one at Harvard\u2019s Quincy House.</span></p> <p><span>When they step into the ballot box, Democratic voters will choose among six major candidates still in the race.</span></p> <p><span>Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg \u201904 announced he would drop out of the Democratic race ahead of Super Tuesday. Nevertheless, Buttigieg\u2019s name \u2014 alongside the names of other Democrats who have dropped out of the race \u2014 will appear on the ballot Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard affiliates were out in force over the weekend campaigning for their candidate of choice. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) held a canvass kick-off event in Harvard Square Saturday, and several other groups also rapped on doors in hopes of boosting turnout.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson examined what experts and Harvard affiliates say Tuesday means for each Democratic hopeful, both in Massachusetts and across the country.</span></p> <p><span>No candidate has more on the line in the Bay State primary than Senator and former Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren.</span></p> <p><span>Despite briefly leading in national polls, Warren struggled in the first four states that weighed in on the race. Warren has finished above 15 percent \u2014 the threshold required to receive a delegate to the DNC \u2014 just once, in Iowa.</span></p> <p><span>Polls suggest Warren could be in jeopardy of losing her home state. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who came within two points of defeating Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Massachusetts presidential primary, is leading Warren on her home turf, according to the RealClearPolitics state polling average.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt is jarring that an incumbent senator might in fact lose her home state\u2019s primary,\u201d Stonehill College Political Science Professor Peter N. Ubertaccio said. \u201cBut the seeds for that were sown four years ago.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Warren has strong support from high-profile elected leaders in Massachusetts, including U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.), and state Attorney General Maura T. Healy \u201992.</span></p> <p><span>Warren recently also picked up the endorsement of a high-profile Harvard student: Jaclyn L. Corin \u201923, a survivor of the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., who went on to co-found the gun-violence prevention group March for Our Lives.</span></p> <p><span>Corin, who canvassed for Warren over the weekend with other Harvard students, said she is confident in where the campaign stands.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cGoing around Cambridge and talking to voters, I felt so much excitement around Elizabeth specifically,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that Cambridge is really loving Warren right now and I\u2019m hoping that Massachusetts swings that way.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>After finishing in first place in three out of four of the state primaries that have taken place so far, including a dominant finish with almost 47 percent of the vote in Nevada, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is entering Super Tuesday as a clear front-runner.</span></p> <p><span>He announced Sunday morning that he had raised $46.5 million in February \u2014 far more than any other 2020 candidate in any given month.</span></p> <p><span>Sanders held a rally in Boston that was attended by more than 13,000 people on Saturday.</span></p> <p><span>Xavier R. Morales \u201923 said he believes Tuesday\u2019s primaries \u2014 including the Massachusetts contest \u2014 will buoy Sanders\u2019s chance of winning the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with everything he wants and how he wants it,\u201d Morales said. \u201cBut I think he\u2019s the best fit.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Like Warren, Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. also struggled to gain traction in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada.</span></p> <p><span>But after a 29-point win in the South Carolina primary on Saturday, Biden supporters on campus hope his campaign is on a rebound.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA lot of the pundits tried to count us out, but the campaign is still alive and it seems like we\u2019re poised to be a strong contender for the nomination,\u201d Harvard College Democrats for Biden co-founder Diego A. Garcia \u201920 said.</span></p> <p><span>Biden is not scheduled to campaign in Massachusetts ahead of Super Tuesday, but several high-profile surrogates who support him will do so, including former Secretary of State John F. Kerry and U.S. Representative Seth W. Moulton \u201901 (D-Mass.).</span></p> <p><span>Garcia, who has canvassed for Biden around the country, said he hopes that Buttigieg\u2019s decision to drop out of the race will help Biden.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI hope that some of his supporters both across the country and on campus will consider the Biden campaign,\u201d Garcia said.</span></p> <p><span>As early-state primaries rolled on, former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has loomed over the race as an unknown.</span></p> <p><span>Bloomberg, whose net-worth is estimated to be around $55 billion, has been spending big in Super Tuesday states, including Massachusetts. Bloomberg has 60 staffers and six field offices open in the Bay State.</span></p> <p><span>Ubertaccio said he is skeptical of Bloomberg\u2019s ability to succeed in Massachusetts, despite his spending.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t make much of people who pour hundreds of millions of dollars into a race and think that that\u2019s somehow going to translate into support on the ground,\u201d Ubertaccio said.</span></p> <p><span>Bloomberg has surged in national polling quickly since entering the race last November, but he lags well behind Sanders and Warren in Massachusetts polls.</span></p> <p><span>For U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Super Tuesday will likely be her last shot at reviving a campaign that has endured disappointing results in all of the primaries thus far.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard College Democrats for Amy Klobuchar founder J.

Griffin", "body": "<p><span>The Harvard Animal Law and Policy Clinic filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court on Thursday supporting a Center for Biological Diversity-led challenge to the Trump administration\u2019s wall along the Mexico-United States border.</span></p> <p><span>The Center for Biological Diversity filed a petition for certiorari on Jan. 31, asking the Supreme Court to review six decisions by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security which allowed the Trump administration to waive over 40 federal laws that would slow down the construction of a border wall.</span></p> <p><span>The Law School clinic represents the North American Butterfly Association and the National Butterfly Center \u2014 who manage a refuge along the border \u2014 as amici curiae in the case. Their brief claims the waivers DHS approved subvert laws that protect endangered species such as butterflies and moths.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis includes irreparably harming dozens of rare animal and plant species that inhabit the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and forever destroying the already extremely fragile ecosystems on which they depend,\u201d the brief reads.</span></p> <p><span>Law Student Ashley Maiolatesi said the proposed border wall will differ from the barriers previously in place and could harm animals living in the area.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt's going to be made of steel and metal and be completely solid, and it's going to have stadium lighting around the top and so that affects a lot of animals in their migration patterns and how they breed and travel and all sorts of things like that,\u201d Maiolatesi said in an interview.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAnything that is like a terrestrial animal \u2014 like the endangered ocelot that lives in that area \u2014 it can't obviously get past this 36-foot high wall,\u201d she added. \u201cThat is a huge issue because these animals are already so endangered.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Maiolatesi also said constructing the wall would necessitate clearing land on either side of the border. The amicus brief describes the proposal for this 150-feet-wide clear-cut area as an \u201cenforcement 10 zone\u201d and claims it would destroy an estimated 20 miles of habitat for each mile of the wall built.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThat eliminates over 13,000 acres of viable habitat along the Rio Grande Valley right now,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>The brief mentions additional concerns about the proposed wall, including the lack of a sloped escape route for animals in the case of fire or flood and an increase in danger, pollution, and erosion due to high-speed patrol vehicles.</span></p> <p><span>Maiolatesi said the Law School clinic hopes to raise awareness about the alleged lack of research into the potential consequences of the proposed wall.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cNone of the environmental assessments or any paperwork was filed on what these ramifications would be if these changes to the law were made,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to really bring to light the animal aspects, and how this was going to be affecting animals in the area throughout the United States and Mexico.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Kelsey J.

{"title": "After So Many Disappointments, a Case for Joe | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>A year ago, the candidates running for the Democratic nomination were the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/27/politics/2020-democratic-field-diversity/index.html\">most diverse</a> ever to run for a major party\u2019s nomination. This diversity reflected the party itself \u2014 a party that\u2019s increasingly uplifting the voices of minorities, working-class Americans, and those suffering through <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-income-inequality-highest-level-50-years-economic-gap-n1058956\">historic</a> inequality. That diversity made me proud.</span></p> <p><span>I was proud because I thought I\u2019d be casting my first vote in a primary election for a candidate that looked like me and that supported many of the ideas I care about. But my candidate would drop out in early January, and over a few weeks, the field would whittle down from the most diverse ever to one whose front-runners have all the diversity of a 77-year-old white man and a 78-year-old white man.</span></p> <p><span>I don\u2019t mean to minimize the ideological differences between these candidates \u2014 though they\u2019ve often voted together in the Senate, more than a handful of differences set them apart. These differences give their supporters ammunition to use against the other candidate, but this infighting will only hurt the party as it struggles to find its leader.</span></p> <p><span>The soul-searching of finding another candidate to support over and over has taken a toll on my enthusiasm and has left me only mildly energized, to say the least. From my conversations with others, I think that\u2019s how many of us young Democrats feel \u2014 especially those from minority backgrounds.</span></p> <p><span>But on Super Tuesday, while the latest of my chosen candidates underperformed, another overwhelmingly won over <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/election-results/super-tuesday/\">crucial minority voters</a>. For all the talk of increasing turnout among young voters and minorities, my then-candidate demonstrated an inability to do so. We cannot extend this primary and risk a repeat of 2016. I want to make the case for Joe Biden.</span></p> <p><span>Joe Biden is a dedicated, passionate public servant, a proven leader, and more than qualified to be the next President of the United States. He\u2019s been endorsed by more local, state, and national leaders than any other candidate, and has demonstrated an ability to build a winning coalition. He is not the perfect candidate. He has made mistakes and is more centrist than many young voters would like, but now is the time for unity because the alternative is too dangerous. I believe these are the calculations that other candidates made before dropping out of the race, and they might also be why a plurality of them now support Biden.</span></p> <p><span>We\u2019ve already seen what can happen when a primary battle goes on for too long. In 2016, the election was decided by a total of <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/459832-the-10-counties-that-will-decide-the-2020-election\">77,700 voters</a> in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. In all of these states, turnout for Democrats decreased from the last election by more than or approximately this amount. No one can know whether this was because Democratic voters didn\u2019t like their candidate or because the lengthy primary race had disillusioned them, but we should not risk the same outcome again. We cannot repeat the mistake of fracturing the party and frustrating its voters.</span></p> <p><span>Over the last four years, we\u2019ve gotten a taste of what\u2019s at stake when Democrats are unable to successfully rally around a candidate. Economic gains and tax cuts have disproportionately <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2019/10/10/trump-tax-cuts-helped-billionaires-pay-less-taxes-than-the-working-class-in-2018/#b4791d03128f\">benefited</a> the wealthy. On civil rights, we\u2019ve watched this administration <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-administration-federal-law-lgbtq-workers-10c1ee34-41e6-4cd0-bc84-5c10ec392398.html\">fail</a> to stand up for those at risk. At the border, we\u2019ve watched this administration commit <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/americas/united-states-of-america/report-united-states-of-america/\">human rights violations</a> against children. We have no plan for the <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/new-trump-rule-would-allow-government-ignore-climate-impacts-major-projects\">climate</a>, no end in sight to a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2019/09/11/chinas-economy-will-shrink-trade-war-has-no-end-in-sight/#31ba67ea1789\">costly trade war</a>. Now a dangerous disease\u2019s global spread has been <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/07/trump-coronavirus-management-style-123465\">fueled</a> by this administration\u2019s empty statements and lack of action.</span></p> <p><span>It\u2019s on all Democrats to rally behind the frontrunner and to make sure we extoll his virtues \u2014 and there are many. <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/joes-story/\">He</a> wrote one of the first climate change bills, has been a leader in the Senate, has taken on the National Rifle Association, spoke up about gay rights before many others, and has remained in the public eye for most of his life. He\u2019s been vetted, he\u2019s experienced, and I trust him to lead this country.</span></p> <p><span>When my home state of Florida votes on March 17, I will cast my ballot for Joe Biden. He wasn\u2019t my first choice, but he is a good man and a good candidate. Come November, he will provide a clear contrast to our current leader for voters around the country.</span></p> <p><span>What\u2019s at stake here are the lives of migrants, health insurance for millions of Americans, the economic stability of farmers, workers, and businessmen alike, the future of our climate, and the sanctity of our democratic institutions. This election is too important to lose in the primaries, again.</span></p> <p><span>To echo the slogan of the 2016 Democratic nominee, we are stronger together. As Democrats, we must recognize this truth and cast aside internal differences. Instead, we must work together to put this country back on track. While the words of a New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/opinion/sunday/joe-biden-2020.html\">opinion</a> columnist say that to choose Joe Biden is \u201cto choose the past over the future,\u201d really it\u2019s to choose a past we can build upon and one that I believe a majority of Americans would prefer to the present. In Joe Biden, I might be voting for a lesser evil, but I\u2019m also voting for the chance at a greater good.</span></p> <p><span><em>Patrick C.

Harvard\u2019s decision has already begun to lay bare these inequalities and will no doubt continue to do so in deeply troubling and dangerous ways.</span></p> <p><span>Coronavirus will hit the most <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/11/harvard-coronavirus-fgli-student-concerns/\">vulnerable</a> members of our community and Cambridge at large with force. Those who stand to lose include people experiencing homelessness, University employees making hourly wages, students with pre-existing risk factors, international and low-income students \u2014 particularly those from countries the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has classified as warning level three \u2014 and students who may face other forms of precarity.</span></p> <p><span>The University must extend support to these groups. It could start by compensating all workers, allowing international students who find themselves in a broad array of challenging immigration conditions to stay on campus, and supporting those from unstable home backgrounds \u2014 many of whom will struggle with Zoom-ing and the other means of remote learning. Furthermore, the University should support organizations that serve vital community service functions, like the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and Y2Y, which run on student labor, to ensure they can perform their work going forward. And it might also consider collaborating with Cambridge on supporting the local economy and small business owners.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond these first concerns \u2014 concerns of life here and now \u2014 there is also the message Harvard sends to the world.</span></p> <p><span>It may not be an exaggeration to say that in removing students from its campus, Harvard has conceded that knowledge production and transmission has effectively stopped. With empty classrooms, archives, laboratories and offices, the closed gates of Harvard University turn away those who see in it the promise of institutions devoted to learning, knowledge, and open dialogue.</span></p> <p><span>At times of instability and catastrophe, our institutions should be beacons of hope. In desperate times, they must continue the vital human work of being, thinking, and acting together. As one of the leading institutions of scholarship in the world, Harvard\u2019s response will inevitably amplify a growing sense of global collapse.</span></p> <p><span>Especially as our government \u2014 in its messaging, policies, and aid \u2014 fails to put together anything even approaching a coherent response to the pandemic, institutions of knowledge should fill the void \u2014 step up where President Donald Trump has now repeatedly stepped away from waiting eyes. The production of knowledge has a significance that, at its best, shines through uncertainty, confusion, and doubt. And as we feel an existential humility in the face of this pandemic, Harvard's choice to close its doors gives us deep reason for worry as students and global citizens.</span></p> <p><span>We must as a community remain courageous, compassionate, and committed to each other. We must, as a University, remain committed to the ideals and hard work and of knowledge as a human enterprise and an enterprise for the betterment of humankind.</span></p> <p><span><em>This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board.

{"title": "\u2018Bombshell\u2019 Breaks Down in Execution of Complex Story | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Jenna X. Bao", "body": "<p><span>Jay Roach\u2019s \u201cBombshell\u201d seeks to tell the ambitious story of three women involved in a groundbreaking sexual harassment case, inspired by the 2016 Fox News sexual harassment scandal involving then-CEO Roger Ailes (John Lithgow). If the movie was going for an explosion, however, the result was more along the lines of a small fire. While the film features several compelling performances and competent worldbuilding, it is burdened by its pacing and incomplete character arcs.</span></p> <p><span>Roach adapts a documentary style storytelling approach with voiceovers and direct-to-camera shots where the female leads Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman), and Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie) break the fourth wall to address the audience. These shots sets a blunt and direct tone for the film from the beginning, as Megyn explains the power structure of the network. This dramatization is further grounded in reality by including media clips from 2016, which depict the world\u2019s reaction to one of the most significant sexual harassment stories in entertainment.</span></p> <p><span>At the core of \u201cBombshell\u201d lies themes of journalism and stories, including accusations, rumors, and suspicions, which help render the toxic workplace at Fox believable. Other persistent motifs include scrutiny, both from the public and others in the office, the similar appearances of nearly all the female characters, and an emphasis on closing doors, which all establish an oppressive and anxious atmosphere as the film\u2019s strongest point.</span></p> <p><span>But the film fails to deliver on the most critical part: doing justice to the stories of the women embroiled in the scandal and harassment. \u201cBombshell\u201d bites off more than it can chew by trying to highlight three separate stories with Megyn, the star anchor, Gretchen, the woman who sues Roger first, and Kayla, a fictional young journalist Roger harasses. Each of these characters\u2019 arcs could easily support a feature film on its own, but with a divided spotlight, none of them feel as fleshed out or as complete as they deserve to be. Confusing pacing choices contribute to this issue: News of the accusation and the investigation don\u2019t occur until well into the movie, after too much time is spent on establishing each character\u2019s situation and Megyn\u2019s \u2018feud\u2019 with Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election. These pacing choices make the development and resolution of the investigation, and each character\u2019s response to the accusations against Roger feels rushed, and thus ingenuine.</span></p> <p><span>Given the limited time the film had to tell so many stories, the focus on Roger\u2019s perspective was another problematic choice. Roger is painted as an aggressive, sexist predator from the beginning, yet many scenes depict Roger\u2019s staunch insistence of his innocence. He\u2019s deeply convinced that he never pushed women to do anything they didn\u2019t want to do and that he never hurt them because of the benefit he gave to their careers. It is a difficult attitude to believe, even though his wife and (female) lawyer seem to accept it completely. While it\u2019s important to tell everyone\u2019s side of the story, the effect essentially paints Roger as a victim despite his decades of destructive behavior. In particular, the scene where the Murdoch family abruptly fires him and refuses to stand by him, suddenly pushing Roger from his empire, depicts him as a frail and defeated old man instead of an abuser who got less punishment than he deserved.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cBombshell\u201d makes a clear effort to give a nuanced look into the complex story of Fox News and the sexual harassment claims that brought down one of the most powerful men in the industry. But failures in the plot development and problematic depictions of Roger Ailes prevent the film from hitting its mark.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014 Staff writer Jenna Bao can be reached at jenna.bao@thecrimson.com.</span></p>"}

{"title": "A Definitive Ranking of the Decade\u2019s Golden Globes Opening Monologues | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": "Amelia F. Roth-Dishy", "body": "<p><span>The art of a good Golden Globes monologue is delicate and elusive. When ignored, the structural racism and sexism that plagues the very industry being lampooned overshadows any attempt at cheer; when mishandled, the same occurs. And the monologue has to be absurd \u2014 but often that absurdity generates itself organically, which is a large part of what makes the Globes such a feckless joy in the sea of gloomy, irresponsible, and unrepresentative escapism that is awards season. The last decade has variably fulfilled this mandate. Below is a ranking of the ten most recent monologues \u2014 from 2011 to 2020, the content of which covers the actual decade, from 2010 to 2019 \u2014 discerned with tools of rigorous science.</span></p> <p><span><strong>10. Ricky Gervais, 2020</strong></span></p> <p><span>Other than slandering the good name of Dame Judi Dench by suggesting she partakes in feline anal sampling like her \u201cCats\u201d character, there was nothing particularly egregious about Gervais\u2019 monologue this year except its unfunniness. The jokes about Martin Scorsese being short? Tired. \u201cJames Corden as a fat pussy?\u201d Witless bully-comedy. Awards shows are stupid and don\u2019t matter? Sure, so stop hosting them. Gervais is at his worst when he gets lazy, and he clearly phoned it in this year: In his own words, \u201cit\u2019s the last time, who cares?\u201d</span></p> <p><span><strong>9. Ricky Gervais, 2012</strong></span></p> <p><span>In 2012, it seemed quite possible that Gervais had not actually seen any of the movies or TV shows in contention except for \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d for which, Gervais riffed, \u201cthe cast spent the weekend with Dame Helen Mirren.\u201d Other targets included Justin Bieber, Kim Kardashian, and Gervais\u2019 own vocabulary, penis, and Hollywood Foreign Press Association contract. Credit where credit is due: Gervais landed a joke about the inanity of James Cameron a year before Tina Fey and Amy Poehler would announce themselves with a quality zinger at the same target. But otherwise, Gervais\u2019 2012 monologue fell flat largely because it wasn\u2019t about much of anything.</span></p> <p><span><strong>8. Jimmy Fallon, 2017</strong></span></p> <p><span>Following Gervais\u2019 signature rambling roast style in 2016, Fallon, historically the nice guy of late-night, tried for a more methodical approach \u2014 and took swings outside the ballroom at President Trump with jokes about the popular vote and Putin. The result was short and sweet enough, but it was hard to overlook the tinge of Fallon\u2019s desperate attempts at reinvention after his <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2016/09/jimmy-fallon-musses-donald-trump-s-hair-on-the-tonight-show-video.html\">infamous hair-tousling interview with Trump</a> lost him both viewers and respect. Ironically, Fallon\u2019s funniest joke had nothing to do with the election and playfully joshed our digital corporate overlords instead. With Jeff Bezos in the audience, Fallon remarked, \u201cHe actually arrived yesterday, but there was no one around to sign for him.\u201d</span></p> <p><span><strong>7. Ricky Gervais, 2016</strong></span></p> <p><span>\u201cI\u2019m gonna do this monologue and go into hiding,\u201d Gervais promised us at the opening of his not-so-triumphant return to the Beverly Hilton stage. Somehow the HFPA found him again this year, which was disappointing. Not much of Gervais\u2019 material landed in 2016, in particular his extended riff on Jeffrey Tambor\u2019s balls that has only become more grotesque with time and context. Gervais did manage a solid class critique of equal pay in Hollywood \u2014 for Jennifer Lawrence, he joked, \u201cthere were marches on the street with nurses and factory workers wondering, \u2018How the hell can a 25-year-old live on $52 million?\u2019\u201d that showed a glimmer of the bubble-popping satire Gervais became famous for. His best jokes have always drawn on Hollywood\u2019s discomfort with its own foundational, elitist truths.</span></p> <p><span><strong>6. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, 2015</strong></span></p> <p><span>Fey and Poehler\u2019s performance in 2015 was a perfectly serviceable version of the formula they had perfected over the previous two years \u2013 the tight, 10-minute set, the roaming collection of indiscriminate zingers, the alternating roles of set-upper and deliverer. Their 2015 monologue is this far down the list only because the novelty of their distinct roasting genius had worn off slightly by their three-peat. A long-winded joke about the many noble accomplishments of Amal Clooney, Average Joe George Clooney\u2019s wife, has the honor of being the second-funniest joke Fey and Poehler ever made about George Clooney at the Golden Globes. (See 2014.)</span></p> <p><span><strong>5. Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg, 2019</strong></span></p> <p><span>Drawing on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7Cc4F7Ayno\">Samberg\u2019s signature roast style of disarming kindness,</a> Oh and Samberg came on board to gamely play, as they called themselves, \u201cthe two nicest people in show business.\u201d Anxious laughter gave way to warm, appreciative guffaws as the two took turns dishing out snappy compliments to stars and to each other for their savage takedowns. From calling Amy Adams a \u201cmega-talented piece of dog crap\u201d to renaming Michael B. Jordan \u201cMichael B. Buff AF,\u201d two very uncontroversial people parlayed their neutrality into serious laughs without hurting any feelings. Was it the funniest monologue of all time? No, but it did feature Sandra Oh telling Amy Adams to \u201ctake your lumps,\u201d and you\u2019re lying if you didn\u2019t chuckle at that.</span></p> <p><span><strong>4. Ricky Gervais, 2011</strong></span></p> <p><span>That organic absurdity which only the Globes can deliver, cutting through awards-season ennui like a butter knife? We got it in 2011, when Gervais\u2019 prolonged absence in the middle of the show led many titillated watchers to believe that he had been fired mid-show for a monologue joke about corruption in the HFPA. Or maybe it was the one about homosexuality and Scientology. Nevertheless, in the early-ish days of Twitter, the public intrigue of a host gone missing added an unexpectedly delicious wrench to the night\u2019s proceedings. Gervais\u2019s jokes were meaner than usual \u2014 and received the full wrath of the discomfited Hollywood elite \u2014 but for the audience watching palpable drama unfold at an otherwise predictable ceremony, the spark was worth the hits. Gervais should have quit while he was ahead.</span></p> <p><span><strong>3. Seth Meyers, 2018</strong></span></p> <p><span>As #MeToo swept Hollywood, Seth Meyers put on a dapper suit and did his very best. The mood of the evening was best encapsulated in Meyer\u2019s first real joke about the outpouring of allegations: \u201cFor the male nominees in the room tonight, this is the first time in three months it won\u2019t be terrifying to hear your name read out loud.\u201d Meyers, drawing on his chops of late-night civic critique, managed to blend the politics of the nation with the politics of the rich and famous. He arguably benefitted from a collective, socialized distaste for many of his targets: Woody Allen, Harvey Weinstein, and Donald Trump all made the cut. Still, an unsteady industry needed a methodical takedown of its villains, and Meyers delivered.</span></p> <p><span><strong>2. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, 2014</strong></span></p> <p><span>The Platonic ideal of the Globes speech in some respects, Fey and Poehler\u2019s second go-around had nothing to prove. What they mastered here was the art of the cut-away: a jaded, sunglasses-wearing Julia Louis-Dreyfus sitting in the film section; a \u201cPoehler\u201d close-up that cut to a beaming Jennifer Lawrence. In the post-Gervais era, audience participation became fun again. 2014 also saw the best Clooney joke of the decade: \u201c[\u2018Gravity\u2019 is] the story of how George Clooney would rather float away into space and die than spend one more minute with a woman his own age.\u201d Fey and Poehler excelled in cheerfully decimating the ranks of Hollywood\u2019s untouchable white men with the power of two well-established white women, and that\u2019s as close as we\u2019ve ever gotten to the backdoor send-up Hollywood deserves.</span></p> <p><span><strong>1. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, 2013</strong></span></p> <p><span>\u201cWhen it comes to torture, I trust the woman who spent three years married to James Cameron.\u201d With that joke emerged a new dynasty. This night established a legendary rapport between two comedians at the peak of their cultural powers, with Poehler thriving in the \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d era and Fey riding the wave of \u201c30 Rock\u201d\u2019s critically acclaimed six-season run. The duo managed to be both meaner and funnier than Gervais ever was, lulling the audience into a false sense of comfort before dropping the guillotine and leaving everyone else\u2019s heads spinning. The night\u2019s precipice of praise and takedown landed all the more raucously because no one expected it. The magic would be conjured again, but never like this. Thankfully, we\u2019ll get <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/tina-fey-amy-poehler-host-golden-globes-2021\">one more round</a> of the best to ever do the dance.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014 Staff writer Amelia F.

{"title": "Whiteness Without the Privilege | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Worried that I would not be able to afford college, I spent the better part of my senior year of high school applying to dozens of scholarships. I grew frustrated as I read through the eligibility criteria of multiple scholarships that deemed me ineligible. I sent emails hoping that perhaps they would understand: I am Middle Eastern, not white. But it was to no avail.</span></p> <p><span>The United States Census Bureau considers people descended from the Middle East and North Africa (known as the MENA region) to be white. Scholarship programs that are targeted towards minority students often use the Census\u2019s race and ethnicity definitions. Despite how uncomfortable I felt checking the \u201cwhite\u201d box on every form, it was not until that moment last year that I fully understood the consequences of the conflation of Arab and white identity on the U.S. Census.</span></p> <p><span>Arab communities have spent <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-census-middle-east-north-africa-race/\">decades lobbying</a> the U.S. Census Bureau to create a separate category for themselves. Toward the end of President Barack Obama\u2019s term, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/01/29/581541111/no-middle-eastern-or-north-african-category-on-2020-census-bureau-says\">the Bureau considered</a> doing so. However, in 2018, the Bureau decided to ask respondents to write in which country they are from after selecting their race, with Egyptian, for example, as an option under white for the 2020 census, which is <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/edge-america-census-begins-tiny-alaska-town-n1118806\">already underway</a> in Alaska.</span></p> <p><span>This option is not enough. Categorizing Arabs as white or black is inaccurate because much like Latinx communities, Middle Easterners and North Africans are racially diverse even within the Arab countries they hail from. By indiscriminately characterizing Arabs as white, the Census and the many organizations that use their race and ethnicity definitions erase the different racial identities that Arab Americans hold. Instead, we are left in limbo, neither seen as white in American society nor considered minorities by the government.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond these identity issues, the lack of representation of Arabs on the U.S. Census has had other significant consequences for our communities. Population data is used for <a href=\"https://civilrights.org/resource/will-you-count-middle-eastern-and-north-african-americans-in-the-2020-census/\">many purposes</a> including political redistricting, the allocation of resources to communities, and the assessment of racial disparities in healthcare. The exclusion of North African and Middle Eastern communities from the Census has <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/arab-americans-lack-representation-2020-census-c8c0a524-ee4b-42d5-aa59-c7a603b25628.html\">resulted in</a> a lack of political power, health data, and social services. Diversity recruitment programs and scholarships for minority students often rely on Census definitions of race and thus exclude Middle Eastern and North African applicants. The end result is that our communities are neglected by both the federal government and private institutions.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the overwhelming consequences of our lack of inclusion, some Arab Americans have legitimate concerns about a separate MENA box. The Arab American existence has been inextricably tied to government surveillance due to media and government branding of us as terrorists, radicals, and extremists. Attacking Muslim communities has been a timeless government pursuit from George W. Bush\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/nseers-muslim-database-qa-trnd/index.html\">NSEERS</a> (an Arab and Muslim registry), to Obama\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/countering-violent-extremism/519822/\">counter-radicalization</a> policing program, to Trump\u2019s Muslim ban. Some Arab American Muslims have concerns that given the government\u2019s track record, providing them with the exact locations of Arab Americans is risky at best.</span></p> <p><span>This concern is justified. In my hometown of New York City, the New York Police Department spent a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/nyregion/nypd-spying-muslims-surveillance-lawsuit.html\">decade </a>spying on my Arab-Muslim community, designating mosques as \u201cpotential terrorist organizations.\u201d Plainclothes officers spied on Muslims in cafes and stores where they considered the presence of a Quran a potential sign of radicalization. When I travel, I am almost always pulled to the side for an extra pat-down and somehow my family\u2019s bags are always selected for TSA\u2019s random checking. If only my whiteness could help me in those circumstances. The U.S. government denies us resources by calling us white, all while subjecting us to the discrimination that our \u201cwhite counterparts\u201d are excluded from.</span></p> <p><span>Last fall, the <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/11/1/pulse-survey-results/\">inaugural</a> Harvard University Pulse Survey on Inclusion and Belonging found that Middle Eastern respondents felt the least belonging of all other races and ethnicity, with only <a href=\"https://pulse.harvard.edu/files/pulse/files/pilot_pulse_survey_ib_data_charts.pdf\">68 percent of Middle Eastern</a> respondents indicating that they at least \u201csomewhat agree\u201d that they belong at Harvard. In contrast, <a href=\"https://pulse.harvard.edu/files/pulse/files/pilot_pulse_survey_ib_data_charts.pdf\">81 percent of white respondents</a> indicated that they felt that they belong, the highest of all racial or ethnic subgroups. Despite these disheartening results, it was validating that the University acknowledged our very existence and that we may have unique struggles as a separate ethnic group by including a Middle Eastern category. Rather than rely on the Census\u2019 false racial and ethnic definitions, college surveys, diversity initiatives, and scholarship programs should recognize Middle Eastern and North Africans as a separate ethnic group, and bring us one step towards being counted in American society. Perhaps the 2030 Census will give Arab Americans minority status through a distinct Census classification without fear of surveillance, but instead with pride in their heritage.</span></p> <p><span><em>Salma Elsayed \u201923, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Stoughton Hall.</em></span></p>"}

Mann traveled from Cambridge to Manchester, N.H. to rally canvassers for Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Saturday.</span></p> <p><span>With Warren off the campaign trail while she attends the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald J. Trump, Mann \u2014 Warren\u2019s husband of 39 years \u2014 has stepped forward as a surrogate. At the event in the campaign\u2019s Manchester field office, he said the Massachusetts Senator is dedicated to working-class families, a demographic that Warren has sought to court.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThis is not a career move for her,\u201d Mann said in a speech to supporters. \u201cThis goes down a lifetime of research, studying, thinking about the problems facing working families and because of the depth of her background, because of the fact that her research led her to always see people whose issues she studying and designing to be effective, that sets her apart from everyone else.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Warren, a former Law School professor, has focused her campaign on tackling income inequality and regulating large financial institutions and individuals, proposing new taxes on corporations and wealthy households.</span></p> <p><span>Mann lauded the volunteers for their work campaigning for the policies Warren \u201ccares about and talks about and fights for.\u201d Reminding canvassers that they are on the \u201cfront lines\u201d of Warren\u2019s campaign, Mann said the key to reaching New Hampshire voters is engaging with locals.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAs with any grassroots campaign, it really is face to face,\u201d Mann said. \u201cIt involves people who are passionate about the issues and about a candidate. They\u2019re passionate about the future on behalf of that candidate and communicate that passion to everyone they see, whether it\u2019s through knocking on doors or through casual conversations.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The New Hampshire primary is Feb. 11. Warren is currently polling fourth among seven Democratic candidates in the state, according to a January CNN poll.</span></p> <p><span>Mann also described Warren\u2019s character on the trail and at home.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe same Elizabeth you see in town halls \u2014 her passion and enthusiasm \u2014 and the Elizabeth you see hugging people in selfie lines is the same Elizabeth who goes shopping for sparkly shoes with our granddaughters and the same Elizabeth who absolutely terrifies bankers,\u201d Mann said.</span></p> <p><span>In his speech, Mann referenced Warren\u2019s sharp questioning of Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf in 2016 during a Senate Banking, House, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing.</span></p> <p><span>Before leaving to canvass, Veronica Joyce, a Manchester resident, said she had never seen Mann in person before but could see why he spent time campaigning for Warren.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s so supportive of her,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cHe seems very calm while also wanting change to happen and wanting people to know the truth about what she\u2019s saying and what she\u2019s putting forward.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Ben Moser and Andrea Goetschius traveled from Norwood, Mass. with their five-year-old son to help canvass. Moser said they were drawn to Warren\u2019s campaign because of her progressive policies.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe anti-corruption pitch that they talked about here is a big piece of it,\u201d Moser said. \u201cMedicare for All is a big piece of it. Universal child care is a very personal piece of it for me.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s the way that all of those policies fit together to buoy folks,\u201d he added.</span></p> <p><span>Moser and Goetschius said they hoped they could instill their values to their son through their work with the Warren campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHe\u2019s just old enough that I want him to at least remember that we tried,\u201d Moser said.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014 Staff writer Charles Xu can be reached at charles.xu@thecrimson.com.

Kennedy III (D-Mass.) criticized incumbent Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), his primary opponent, for Markey\u2019s initial vote in favor of the Iraq War at a Cambridge Democrats event featuring both candidates Sunday night.</span></p> <p><span>The two candidates spoke to a room of about 150 local residents at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. Kennedy, who has served in the House of Representatives since 2012, said Massachusetts Democrats \u201ccould get more\u201d out of their representation in the Senate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI believe we are at a moment of great consequence for our party, for our commonwealth, and for our nation \u2014 and that those times require a Senator who is going to be fully engaged in every aspect of this job,\u201d Kennedy said.</span></p> <p><span>Markey declined to target Kennedy directly in his remarks. Asked by an audience member what policy issue the two Democrats differ on the most, Markey punted.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to leave that to him to tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m running on my record. I\u2019m running on my achievements \u2014 the things that I\u2019ve fought for, the things that I\u2019ve been successful on.

After the strike, House Democrats, who criticized the move, passed a resolution to restrict President Donald J. Trump\u2019s war powers in Iran.</span></p> <p><span>Markey said Sunday that he regretted voting for the 2002 Iraq War resolution. In an interview after the event, Markey pointed to his endorsements from peace groups, including Massachusetts Peace Action \u2014 a Cambridge-based non-profit advocating for peaceful foreign policy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThey see me as the leader on peace issues \u2014 not only here, but across the country,\u201d Markey said.</span></p> <p><span>Markey, who traveled back to Massachusetts from Washington for the event, focused his remarks on his plans to pressure Senate Republicans to vote in favor of witness testimony in President Trump\u2019s ongoing Senate impeachment trial.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSo far, there\u2019s been [an] overwhelming avalanche of evidence which has been presented that the president did, in fact, try to extort an investigation of the Biden family out of the Ukraine President,\u201d Markey said.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe evidence is overwhelming,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Republicans say it is not. And so we say to them, \u2018Then give us the witnesses.\u2019\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Former Cambridge Mayor Marc C.

Burstein", "body": "<p><span>As members of Harvard\u2019s graduate student union return to work after nearly a month on strike, labor experts say the union may have ended their record-setting demonstrations due to a variety of factors, including economic pressure and growing hopes of reaching a contract agreement.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers representatives <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/31/strike-ending-breaker/\">announced</a> in an email to union members Monday that strikers would return to work Jan. 1 without reaching a contract with the University.</span></p> <p><span>Student workers <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/3/grad-union-strikes/\">began</a> their strike on Dec. 3, the last day of the fall semester. Over the past several weeks, union workers have picketed in <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/3/grad-union-begins-picketing/\">Harvard Yard</a> and in the <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/6/longwood-union-strike/\">Longwood</a> medical area, calling for the University to acquiesce to their demands in contract negotiations.</span></p> <p><span>Mark G. Pearce \u2014 Executive Director of the Workers' Rights Institute at Georgetown University Law Center and a former Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that upholds U.S. labor law \u2014 said the strike may have ended due to financial considerations.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cSome strikes can last longer than others because there are strike funds available depending on the capabilities of the National Union,\u201d Pearce said. \u201cOther strikes fold because the economic pressure that ensues is too much for the strikers to withstand.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>William A. Herbert, Executive Director of the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions, a New York-based think tank, said he believed the agreement between the University and HGSU-UAW to enter federal mediation could be a reason the union decided to end the strike.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cA strike is a means to an end, not an end in and of itself,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cI suspect that the reason for ending the strike is that the ends of reaching most of what was being sought has been successful. And that now it's just trying to finish up and reach a final agreement.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The union and the University agreed to engage <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/20/outside-mediators-proposal/\">federal mediators</a> to facilitate collective bargaining between the University and the union beginning with their Jan. 7 negotiating session. In an email to members of HGSU-UAW, the union\u2019s bargaining committee wrote that Harvard\u2019s commitment to begin mediation served as a \u201cnew foundation to finish negotiations.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Former NLRB Chairwoman and former Deputy Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Wilma B. Leibman said she believes it is a \u201cvery good sign\u201d that the University and the union have agreed to federal mediation.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe mediators certainly give it their all to try to help the parties reach an agreement, to try to find ways to deal with difficult issues that are really keeping them apart,\u201d Leibman said. \u201cIt's entirely possible that the mediator got them to agree to stop the strike and give bargaining another chance.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Pearce noted that federal mediation is often an effective way for both sides to reach an agreement.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe mediator is always striving for a settlement, striving for the common ground in the negotiations, and sometimes a mediated process is the best way to get to that common ground,\u201d Pearce said. \u201cOftentimes it's mediated negotiation that will bring to light that which would stimulate settlement.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Experts also pointed to other challenges the union may face as potential factors in their decisionmaking, including a<a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/9/21/nlrb-proposal-reverse-graduate-student-employee-status/\"> new rule</a> proposed by the NLRB in late September that would reverse the <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/24/nlrb-grad-student-unionization/\">decision</a> that first granted graduate students the right to unionize.</span></p> <p><span>Leibman said this proposed rule could affect bargaining between the University and HGSU-UAW.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThere's always the lingering question whether Harvard is going through this in good faith trying to reach an agreement, which I would hope, or whether they're trying to run out the clock until the NLRB does something, and then Harvard wouldn't be legally obliged to do something,\u201d Leibman said.</span></p> <p><span>Leibman added that the outcome of the negotiation sessions would rely on both parties\u2019 willingness to negotiate.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI would hope that both Harvard and the union really have a good faith effort to make collective bargaining work here\u2026 I\u2019d like them to be able to show the Trump majority on the NLRB that collective bargaining can work,\u201d she said.</span></p> <p><span>Even if the NLRB\u2019s proposed rule is implemented, Herbert said private sector institutions \u2013 including private universities like Harvard \u2013 have the option to \u201cvoluntary recognize\u201d graduate student unions. In recent years, Brown University and Georgetown University both used the voluntary recognition process to facilitate collective bargaining with their graduate employees.</span></p> <p><span>When the NLRB announced the new proposal, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain said Harvard was \u201creviewing the proposed rule\u201d to establish how it may impact negotiations.</span></p> <p><span>Even though the union ended its strike without reaching a contract, the strike set new records. HGSU-UAW went on strike for 29 days \u2013 from Dec. 3 to Dec. 31 \u2013 making it the longest strike in higher education since 2012, according to Herbert.</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of the outcome, Pearce said HGSU-UAW\u2019s strike showed the University the union\u2019s solidarity and highlighted the University\u2019s need for graduate student workers.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cThe reason why there\u2019s a right to strike is because it's designed to stimulate negotiations through economic pressure,\u201d Pearce said. \u201cIf that is the result, then striking is worthwhile.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>Former NLRB chairman William B. Gould IV said HGSU-UAW\u2019s strike could have national implications for future actions by graduate workers.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cI think that it does demonstrate to both to Harvard itself and the country at large the seriousness and importance of these issues and the resolve of a union like this one to endure both hardship and delay in getting to its objective,\u201d Gould said.</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Ellen M.

At points, hundreds of students and supporters joined the picket line.</span></p> <p><span>Still, the union and University have yet to reach a contract. They remain at odds over the three provisions that prompted picketing: compensation, health care, and grievance procedures for discrimination and sexual harassment complaints.</span></p> <p><span>The union first stepped toward the strike via an October authorization <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/8/graduate-student-union-vote/\">vote.</a> The vote began Oct. 15, exactly one year after HGSU-UAW first met Harvard at the bargaining table. By Oct. 25, more than 90 percent of the union <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/26/harvard-grad-union-authorizes-strike/\">had voted in favor</a> of the strike. Of the 2,682 members who cast ballots in the election, 90.4 percent voted in favor of withholding their labor, according to an email sent to HGSU-UAW members by the union\u2019s bargaining committee.</span></p> <p><span>Following the vote, HGSU-UAW announced that it would strike if negotiations were unable to reach a contract by the union\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/11/5/union-strike-deadline/\">deadline</a> of Dec. 3.</span></p> <p><span>As negotiations stalled, the union began <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/3/grad-union-begins-picketing/\">picketing</a> on Dec. 3, despite cold winds and snow. The demonstrators carried signs reading \u201cUAW on Strike\u201d and chanted \u201cWhat do we want? Contract! When do we want it? Now!\u201d Throughout the day, they transitioned between various marching routes in Harvard Yard with a strike headquarters located at the Phillips Brooks House.</span></p> <p><span>The union also set up picket lines outside Harvard Yard. Student workers at the University's Longwood campus \u2014 home to the Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School, and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/6/longwood-union-strike/\">joined their Cambridge counterparts</a> in strike activities, including hours of chanting, singing, marching, and daily rallies.</span></p> <p><span>Picketers at Longwood chanted various science-themed slogans, shouting, \u201cPut pipettes down! We need a contract now!\u201d and \u201cHey, don\u2019t make that buffer, while your fellow students suffer!\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The strike also had practical consequences for Harvard affiliates. Some classes collectively walked out of their lecture halls as part of a University-wide walk out held on the first day of the strike. Other courses <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/4/strike-impact-classes/\">cancelled</a> review sessions and office hours and delayed grading course material and final exams.</span></p> <p><span><a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/6/UPS-delivery-delays-strike/\">Mail and package deliveries</a> slowed as individual picketers attempted to block delivery entrances, asking drivers to withhold their deliveries. United Parcel Services stopped deliveries to Harvard in support of picketers, causing a delay in packages sent to the University\u2019s Cambridge campus and several undergraduate Houses.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to the mail deliveries, the graduate student union strike also disrupted BorrowDirect, a service that enables library borrowing across academic institutions in the United States. UPS delivers some of BorrowDirect\u2019s mail.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout the strike, several high-profile public figures participated alongside union members. United States Representatives <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/15/kennedy-hgsu-picket/\">Joseph P. Kennedy III</a> (D-Mass.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Katherine Clark (D-Mass.); Massachusetts State Representative Marjorie C. Decker; then-Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern; Cambridge City Councilors Sumbul Siddiqui, Alanna M. Mallon, Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler; and Boston City Councilor Priscilla MacKenzie \u201cKenzie\u201d Bok \u201911 all picked up shifts on the picket line.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, a number of Democratic presidential candidates took to Twitter to support the striking students. United States Senator and Harvard Law School professor emerita Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jul\u00edan Castro, Mayor Pete P. M. Buttigieg \u201904, and former Vice President Joe Biden all stood in solidarity with the union.</span></p> <p><span>During the strike\u2019s second week, <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/6/strike-dept-emails/\">academic departments</a> across the University emailed graduate student teaching staff to ask whether they were participating in the strike, prompting outcry from some union members.</span></p> <p><span>One memo \u2014 originally sent out to Government department affiliates by Chair Jeffry A. Frieden \u2014 was posted in part by union members on Twitter. Frieden informed graduate students that they are responsible for reporting whether they are working and that those who strike should not expect to be paid. He also reminded faculty that they are \u201cmanagement\u201d and were still responsible for \u201cinstructional responsibilities.\u201d In a separate email, the Government department asked graduate students teaching fellows whether or not they were striking.</span></p> <p><span>In response, the HGSU-UAW organizing committee wrote letters to department chairs expressing concern about emails asking faculty members to report graduate students\u2019 strike status. In a letter obtained by The Crimson, they stated that administrators may use such information to \u201cdock students\u2019 pay\u201d and requested that chairs \u201cproceed with more caution\u201d when distributing work to department members.</span></p> <p><span>More than a week after the strike began, the University and union had <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/11/hgsu-harvard-yet-to-meet/\">yet to announce</a> plans to meet at the bargaining table again. They eventually <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/13/hgsu-strike-bargaining-session/\">scheduled</a> a Dec. 18 bargaining session, marking the first meeting between the groups since just before the strike began.</span></p> <p><span>The HGSU-UAW bargaining committee headed to the Dec. 18 session buoyed by cheers from rank-and-file members, but left disappointed. At the conclusion of that session, Harvard and the union <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/19/union-strike-negotiations/\">reached</a> tentative agreements on six contract provisions regarding discipline and discharge, strikes, grievance and arbitration, titles and classifications, an emergency grant, and housing. But none of the new agreements related to the issues at the heart of the strike.</span></p> <p><span>The next day, though, the nature of negotiations changed. On the afternoon of Dec. 19, University Provost Alan M. Garber \u201976 announced that the University would suggest engaging <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/20/outside-mediators-proposal/\">federal mediators</a> in an attempt to reach a contract.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cAlthough these proposals reflect the University\u2019s continued good-faith commitment to these negotiations \u2013 we have reached tentative agreements on 18 articles \u2013 movement has been minimal on remaining areas of substantial disagreement between the parties,\u201d he wrote.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cToward that goal, we believe that the parties would now be best served by utilizing the services of a mediator to help us resolve remaining issues,\u201d Garber added.</span></p> <p><span>Union organizers soon informed members in an email they had accepted Harvard\u2019s proposal and scheduled a bargaining session for Jan. 7. They would later cite the change as a victory substantive enough to merit returning to work.</span></p> <p><span>On Dec. 30, the HGSU-UAW bargaining committee emailed members announcing they planned to <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/12/31/strike-ending-breaker/\">end the strike</a> the next evening. Still without a contract agreement, they urged union members to continue expressing their displeasure to administrators until the clock struck midnight on New Year's Eve.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIn order to win a fair contract, we all will need to keep organizing together,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cAnd as we head into mediation, we look forward to continuing to fight for a more just and equitable university with all of you.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff writer Declan J.

In a letter to United States Senators Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ABA cited interviews in which VanDyke was characterized as \u201clacking in knowledge\u201d and \u201carrogant,\u201d and raised concerns about his judgment towards LGBTQ individuals.</span></p> <p><span>The Ninth Circuit did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p> <p><span>Based in California, the Ninth Circuit, which reviews cases for several western states, is one of the most desirable clerkships, according to Bloomberg Law.</span></p> <p><span>In a follow-up message on Dec. 19, the Law School referenced other 2020 clerkships that received zero applications from Harvard, including the Los Angeles chambers of California appellate court judge John Wiley and a recently confirmed Ninth Circuit judge, Patrick Bumatay.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIf you could be available for a 2020 clerkship, now is a time you can stand out with just the Harvard brand name, not to mention your other qualifications, as the applicant pool nationwide shrinks,\u201d the message read.</span></p> <p><span>That same day, the People\u2019s Parity Project \u2014 a Law School student group that has pushed law firms to dispose of controversial arbitration policies \u2014 tweeted criticizing the school\u2019s messages.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHarvard thinks we have \u2018wasted opportunities\u2019 by not applying to these judges,\u201d the group wrote.</span></p> <p><span>A screenshot posted on the organization\u2019s Twitter shows listings for clerkships for VanDyke, Southern District of Ohio Judge Douglas Cole, Eastern District of Missouri Judge Sarah Pitlyk, Ninth Circuit Judge Patrick Bumatay, and California Court of Appeals Judge John Wiley in Los Angeles.</span></p> <p><span>Both Pitlyk and VanDyke have received \u201cNot Qualified\u201d ratings by the American Bar Association.</span></p> <p><span>Law School Assistant Dean for Career Services Mark Weber wrote in an emailed statement that his office works to share available clerkship opportunities for students.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe work to share available clerkship opportunities with our students, confident they will apply for the ones that best suit their interests and needs,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe understand that different judges appeal to different applicants for different reasons.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>University of Michigan law professor Leah Litman \u2014 who previously taught at the Law School \u2014 also sharply criticized Harvard\u2019s message on Twitter. Litman previously clerked for the Sixth Circuit and for now-retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s not responsible to tell students that they should apply to any/every judge, or to say that *anyone* with whom the students might disagree is a judge they should be willing to clerk for,\u201d she wrote on Dec. 20. \u201cIt is also a good reminder to our profession that we should be thinking (and rethinking) the kinds of positions/jobs/work experiences we reward.\"</span></p> <p><span>In a blog post, Litman added that Harvard students are in a \"fortunate position,\" as they come from a \u201ctop law school.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u201cHLS students are in an extremely fortunate position \u2013 because they\u2019re at a top law school, they have more choices among clerkships than students who might be applying for clerkships from a lower ranked school,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf some students are exercising that privilege to stand up for themselves or others, they should be applauded, not chastised.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>The Law School\u2019s Office of Career Services wrote in a post that it will continue to promote more clerkship opportunities in the future.</span></p> <p><span>\u201cWe will continue to post separately about any new opportunities that come to our attention for before Fall 2020,\u201d the school wrote. \u201cThere will be more.\u201d</span></p> <p><span>\u2014Staff Writer Michelle G.
