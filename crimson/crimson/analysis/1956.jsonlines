{"title": "The Forgotten Man | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Historians, political scientists, and just plain politicians will probably be pondering the rise of Senator Joseph McCarthy to prominence and power for a good many years to come.  Even more spectacular, in a way, has been the Wisconsin senator's rapid descent into almost as much political obscurity as a United States senator can ever hope to attain.  Harry Truman and Richard Nixon are not exactly noted for their harmony on most issues, but both have labeled McCarthy a political has-been in recent months and agree that his power has virtually evaporated.  A.D.A. national chairman Joseph Rauh, Jr. tuned in his sensitive antennae on McCarthy last summer and gave the \"all clear\" signal to professional libertarians everywhere, assuring them that \"the McCarthy era is over.\"</span></p> <p><span>That statement in itself represents a remarkable transformation of attitude.  One needs only to recall that less than three years ago, its author was apparently ready to believe that Senator McCarthy had stored a private arsenal of Lugers, revolvers, and machine guns in the basement of the Senate office building.  Whether Rauh feared at the time that Private Schine, the military member of the McCarthy menagerie, might be preparing to lead a march up the Capitol steps did not become entirely clear from the testimony at the recent Hughes perjury trial in New York City.  But the trial revealed that responsible and otherwise rational men were willing to attribute both powers and motives to the junior senator from Wisconsin that might make Satan himself a little envious.  Nor was the phobia confined to the self-appointed guardians of the liberal tradition.  At the height of McCarthy's influence in 1954, articulate members of both parties seemed convinced that the Republic had not been in greater danger since the colors came down at Fort Sumter in 1861.</span></p> <p><span>The Republic has so far survived.  And McCarthy, for the moment at least, has become the \"forgotten man\" of American politics.  His decline can actually be plotted statistically, in terms of the politician's private Hooper rating, press and magazine publicity.  Dramatic evidence lies even in the monotonous pages of the Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature.  In his two-year publicity hey-dey, 1953 and 1954, McCarthy was the subject of no less than 474 articles in major American periodicals, an average of 237 articles for each of the two years.  In the last twelve months, he managed to break into magazine print only 33 times, with most of the articles appearing early in 1955 just after the Senate censure.  Only one major publication saw fit to write on him at all in the last three months of the year--and that was the evervindictive <i>Nation,</i> whose correspondent pursued the Senator on a speaking tour to Boston to write a piece entitled \"Comeback Flop.\"  The news index of the New York <i>Times</i> tells the same story of lack of stories.  In 1953 and 1954, McCarthy made the front page of the <i>Times</i> almost as much as the President of the United States.  It was a rare day when some newspaper somewhere in the country did not carry a picture of the Senator in one of another of his expressionless poses.  In 1955, McCarthy dropped off page one of the <i>Times</i> almost altogether, often to an uncomfortable position at the tail-end of a story on Senator Knowland or Vice-President Nixon.</span></p> <p><span>All in all, 1955 was an aimless and frustrating year for the Senator.  The Ford Foundation's Fund for the Republic, the National Labor Relations Board, the United States guided missile program, the Administration's farm policy, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Milton Eisenhower and a cherished McCarthy enemy, Harold Stassen, all came in for their share of criticism, but somehow the public and the press failed to sit up and take notice as they had done only a few months before.  With his committee chairmanship gone in the Democratic victory in 1954 McCarthy was just another minority member of the Senate Committee on Government Operations; he has never been much disposed to provide newspaper copy for another man's headlines.  On the legal front, he lost two important decisions in the acquittal of Corliss Lamont and Leon Kamin on contempt of Congress charges.</span></p> <p><span>Increasingly, McCarthy has taken his one-man show out of the Senate and into the back-country.  Speaking invitations and Americanism awards from veterans' groups, Knights of Columbus chapters, and other organizations of public-spirited citizens are always forthcoming when the Senator arrives in the neighborhood.  Yet even some of the traditional centers of support appear to have cooled slightly in their enthusiasm for McCarthy, or at least in their outrage at his enemies.  In past years, a visit to Boston, for example, was certain to induce an outpouring of loyalty among large elements of the population, much as Antaeus in the Greek myth gained renewed strength by contact with Mother Earth.  The Senator's supporters were still vocal enough to cause a mistrial when he came to testify in the Kamin trial, but there seemed to be fewer of them.  He spoke to rows of empty seats in Boston late in October, despite the presence on the platform of such stalwarts as Joseph P. Kennedy, James Michael Curley, and Republican State Chairman Elmer C. Nelson.  Even in Wisconsin, according to some reports, McCarthy's popularity has diminished, although letter writers to the Milwaukee <i>Journal</i> still insist:  \"Every loyal citizen of Wisconsin can feel proud to be represented by this courageous patriot.\"  The fact that the patriot has made a point of championing the Wisconsin dairy farmer against the \"open war\" on farmers of the Eisenhower Administration perhaps helps to account for some of the favorable sentiment he still arouses in the state.</span></p> <p><span>As for the future, it seems safe to say only that McCarthy's prospects are slightly brighter than they were a year ago, while his position in the country at large and in the Republican Party remains far weaker than it was three years ago.  An Eisenhower decision not to seek re-election would remove McCarthy's most formidable antagonist within the G.O.P. and would presumably give the right wing a greater voice in party policy.  Yet the right wing has a more stable and respected leader in Senator Knowland, and McCarthy might still find himself well to the outside, still looking in.</span></p> <p><span>There remains the possibility that he could ride back to great influence on a wave of popular discontent, if the cold war turns hot again and the United States becomes involved in new difficulties in Asia.  In his protest against the present course of American foreign policy, McCarthy has announced:  \"I shall go to the people\" to warn them against the dangers of an accommodation with communism.  \"I may be too late, but insofar as my abilities and endurance permit,\" he promises, \"I shall see to it that this country does not die without the people of this country being given a chance to save it.\"  But there are other Cassandras besides McCarthy crying out in the land, and it is likely that Senator Knowland, for one, would be a greater beneficiary of widespread public disillusionment with \"the spirit of Geneva.\"  In politics, as in boxing, the heavyweights supposedly never come back.  Yet it was an exciting brawl while it lasted.  And the men who came not to praise McCarthy, but to bury him, have been wrong before.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Eisenhower Administration:  Its Security Record | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Regardless of who won the 1952 election, the nation's loyalty and security programs were ripe for a thoroughgoing revision by the end of the Truman Administration.  Disorganized and handcuffed by continuing Congressional investigations, hiring procedures were uneven and inadequate to protect the national security.</span></p> <p><span>Few, therefore, would question the value of the new President's efforts to keep the government free from subversion and raise popular respect for the bureaucracy.  In this regard the Administration has heeded its public mandate.  But in the workings of the Eisenhower security program and in the President's conduct of the executive office lie some of the most justifiable criticisms of the Republican regime.</span></p> <p><span>By 1953, when Eisenhower entered the White House, 4,300,000 individuals were covered under the Truman loyalty and security programs.  Under these systems only 414 employees had been suspended as risks from 1947 to 1952.  For most civil servants, \"reasonable doubt\" of loyalty was required before they could be suspended, but a special Congressional order had invested heads of certain sensitive agancies with broader powers of \"summary dismissal.\"  Approximately 800,000 civilians in the Atomic Energy Commission, the Department of Defense, the armed forces, the State Department, C.I.A., E.C.A., and the Voice of America were covered by this latter \"security\" requirement.</span></p> <p><span><b>Uniform Standard</b></span></p> <p><span>Under mounting public criticism, the Truman Administration set up the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security to study the whole loyalty system.  In April 1952, the Committee recommended that the government establish one encompassing program based on \"suitability\" or general fitness for federal employment.  Such a criterion would have regularized the security procedure and enabled the government to suspend an employee without undue damage to his personal reputation.</span></p> <p><span>But when it came time for the Eisenhower Administration to supply its own uniform program, the keystone became security instead of suitability.  Under the new standard, \"employment or retention in employment in the Federal Service\" had to be \"clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\"  The program thereby greatly extended the possible cause for suspension and placed the stigma of \"security risk\" on employees whose sins were no worse than casual association with characters of dubious loyalty.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, the Eisenhower order eliminated the Loyalty Review Board, a commission of twenty leading lawyers and educators set up by President Truman to hear appeals on security firings.  The abolition of the Board, however, lessened rather than increased the uniformity of government security procedures, as each department head was given the sole responsibility over the security of his office.  This lack of central organization led to confused situations like that in which Wolf Ladejinsky was cleared by the State Department and then suspended by the Department of Agriculture on tenuous grounds.</span></p> <p><span><b>Injustices</b></span></p> <p><span>Several such blatant examples of inequity were corrected only after embarassing public protest.  The Air Force removed Lt. Milo Radulovitch as a reserve officer because his sister was a Communist, and the Navy Department suspended a cartographer, Abraham Chasanow, on the basis of derogatory rumors that were proved baseless.  Chasanow's case illustrated the injustice to government employees caused by the operations of the Eisenhower program.  Under severe economic and financial hardship during his 13-month suspension, Chasanow was denied an opportunity to confront the witnesses who had testified against him.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, Administration spokesmen, including the President, were deliberately misrepresenting the number of employees fired under the Eisenhower program and were trying to place sole responsibility on the Democrats for the fact that the government has been \"honeycombed with Communists.\"  Administration figures on security firings ranged from 1,459 up to 9,600, but Congressional findings last year revealed that only 342 employees had actually been removed as security risks.  And many of these, it was discovered, had been hired since 1953.  When this information was made public, the Administration hastily ceased its allegations but never offered to correct its misleading statements.  In this context, the \"numbers game\" seems to have been a calculated attempt to keep the issue of Communists in government at the focus of political debate, rather than to remove subversion from national concern.</span></p> <p><span><b>Low Morale</b></span></p> <p><span>But the Eisenhower Administration's security record has more significant failings than its political shenanigans, and its needless damage to lives and careers.  More important are the profound effects that security-consciousness has had on the public mind.  It is still too early to asses the popular conception of freedom that has emerged from the assaults of Senator McCarthy.  It is too early also to examine the damage to government morale and effectiveness stemming from unimpeded Congressional investigations and loyalty requirements that place a premium on mediocrity.  But it is alarmingly clear that, as government work becomes less attractive, applications for career posts in the foreign and civil service have fallen markedly.  And within the Foreign Service, according to Senator Alexander Wiley, ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, 97 percent of the officers feel that morale in the Service is poor.  A leading scientist, as well, Vannevar Bush, has warned that our defense effort has been impaired by uncertainty and distrust arising from security restrictions--notably from revulsion at the fate of J. Robert Oppenheimer.</span></p> <p><span>This retrospective view stands in gloomy contrast to the optimism that greeted the President in 1953.  Then, his program had promise of settling the subversive issue fairly and efficiently.  Because he was a military hero honored with deep national affection, it was hoped that he could not only overcome McCarthy-inspired hysteria with the force of his moral leadership, but also that he could lift government service from the level at which Truman's stubborn devotion to his political friends had left it.  Public criticism and court decisions have since forced the Administration to soften some of its initial harsh policies, but the fact remains that the President, like his predecessor, has failed to use his office to create a climate in which government service can be a vital and creative career.</span></p>"}

However, I cannot condone the pseudo-scientific criticism of Republican policy given by Mr. Norris in the September 28 issue of the CRIMSON.</span></p> <p><span>First, may I ask why Mr. Norris did not use statistics generally available for 1955 and early 1956?  If he decries the size and behavior of the public debt in 1954, should he not become apoplectic at its movement in 1955?  In 1955 gross public and private debt increased $61 billion to $76 billion--more than ever before in a peacetime year.</span></p> <p><span>Further, 1954 was not a boom year.  The period was termed even by the Republicans to be one of \"rolling readjustment\" caused, some say, by the sharp decline in government expenditures of almost $7 billion.  Government expenditures fell from $74.3 billion (1953) to $67.8 billion in 1954.  Mr. Norris says that government expenditures total $75 billion.  If he insists upon using this approach to present his political views he should at least present the correct statistics.</span></p> <p><span>May I ask, also, how Mr. Norris justifies his reference to \"a plethora of non-essential consumer items\"?  I could take exception with the rest of the sentence but the phrase \"nonessential consumer items\" intrigues me.  I am curious to discover how he determines the essentiality of a consumer good.  Not being omnipotent, I have a difficult time conceiving of anyone being able to decide what is and what is not necessary for each individual.</span></p> <p><span>The use of half truths and colored prose seem to completely obviate Mr. Norris' call for an \"analytical and candid approach\" to the present political campaign.

{"title": "Happy Talk | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Just a bit like <i>South Pacific's</i> Bloody Mary, President Eisenhower seems to have been concerned largely with \"talking about things he'd like to do\" to meet the nation's crucial education problem.  For the President has succeeded only in setting other people talking about a problem which had become pressing several years before his election.  Not that this talk has been without its uses.  The White House Conference on Education did serve to stir the interest of either apathetie or conservative segments of the populace.  Certain previously reactionary groups as a result of the conference have suddenly taken an interest in organizing local action to alleviate the critical overcrowding of their schools.</span></p> <p><span>Despite all the Eisenhower administration's talk and study, however, no legislation, and not even a comprehensive program materialized.  Even Eisenhower admits that the latest imaginative addition to federal aid to education was made six years ago, though the intervening years were fraught with war babies.  The reasons for the President's failure in this respect are not completely clear.  The President blames the Democrats, who, he maintains, voted against his bill 215 to 9.  He fails to point out that a majority of Democrats afterward voted for a similar bill, which the Republicans managed to kill through their shenanigans over the Powell amendment.  Thinking to make political capital by supporting the enforcement of integration through restriction of federal aid, the Republicans voted for the Powell amendment.  Then using the amendment as their excuse, they proceeded to quash the bill.</span></p> <p><span>Republican responsibility for the Powell amendment fiasco seems fairly definite--ninety-six Republicans in the House voted for the Powell amendment and against the bill.  Whether, as the Democrats claim, Eisenhower might have prevented this devious behavior is open to question.  It is possible that Ike's inaction on the question was based on his principle of \"quiet leadership,\" although on other issues he has exerted himself conspicuously.  One factor in this particular disintegration of White House leadership was the President's somewhat disabling post-operation convalescene at the time.  Whatever the cause, by allowing Republican legislators to play political shuttlecock with a vital problem, Ike has let the seed of his prestige fall on stony ground.</span></p> <p><span>Even had the President secured passage of his education bill, it would have been inadequate.  The Eisenhower administration concerned itself only with school construction, whereas the program proposed by Stevenson in his latest New America report asks in addition for aid for teachers' salaries, government scholarships for higher education, increased foreign student exchange, and the encouragement of adult education.</span></p> <p><span>The fact that Stevenson does not have to convince a large wing of his party of America's educational needs helps to explain his much bolder and more comprehensive plan of action.  Although there are some Democrats who oppose increased federal aid for education, the majority need no urging to see the danger of the situation, particularly in states without industry and consequently without much tax income.  Even considering the strong support of his party on this issue, however, Stevenson's program reveals a more imaginative and comprehensive approach then has yet appeared in an Eisenhower proposal on education.  In one report he has informed the people far more of their need than Eisenhower has in four years of happy talk and dog paddling.  And the remedies which the Governor prescribes for the nation's educational ills are indisputable--all are absolute necessities for a nation which hopes to lead the world and still maintain its democratic processes.  In view of the international responsibilities and a concurrent sophistication which have lately been thrust upon us, these programs are imperative, even at the cost of as yet uncalculated billions.  The additional government expenditure proposed by the Governor is not likely to make the more conservative taxpayers happy.  But as an investment it is certainly as likely to pay off as the 60 billions currently being spent on defense.  If Stevenson does not talk happy talk on the school issue, he does talk about things that he, and more important, his party are very likely to do.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Some Heat for the Melting Pot | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When President Eisenhower announced in his State of the Union Message that he would seek changes in the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act, most opponents of the Act predicted that the President would continue to mouth platitudes about the need for revision, but do nothing to pressure Congress into action.  Fears that the President would just continue to whistle his vague tune were happily corrected by his message to Congress last week, when he spelled out a program that seems to please even the strongest foes of the present immigration law.  If he gives these measures the Presidential support necessary to pass during an election year there will be even greater grounds for congratulation.</span></p> <p><span>The President's suggestions certainly go far toward removing the inequities of the present law.  Not only does the President favor an over-all increase in immigrants from 154,000 to about 220,000, but he also would let unused quotas, from nations like England, Ireland, and Germany--which now account for two-thirds of the total quota--be distributed among nations that need higher allotments.  Greece, for instance, now has a total quota of only 308, Turkey 225, and Japan 185.  The President would also remove altogether from quotas the refugees who have entered under the special Refugee Relief Act and who have used up large portions of Eastern European allotments far into the 22nd Century.</span></p> <p><span>These specific changes are not as far-reaching as a suggestion in the President's message that the whole idea of quotas based on national origins needs review.  Established by a not-so-international Congress in 1924, the present quota system frankly discriminates against Southern and Eastern Europeans and Asians under the theory that people with English or Northern European names make better citizens.  In view of the number of contributions made by the unfavored groups in the past, this thesis is absurd.  In this respect the President's suggestion for a special, experimental quota of 5,000--to be distributed with regard not to nationality, but to cultural and technical skill--is a welcome prelude to a fulll-scale review of the whole concept of quotas based on national origins.</span></p> <p><span>Even the unexpectedly strong plea for basic revisions in the McCarran-Walter Act is not going to effect the needed reforms in an election year.  Faced with President Truman's veto of the Act just before the last election, over two-thirds of the House and Senate, voted to over-ride.  And among those who voted to pass the Act were many Democratic Senators who now control important posts--Johnson, George, Fulbright, Byrd, Eastland--as well as both Knowland and Bridges.  If the President puts his full authority behind the changes, however, Congress should accept some, even if not all, the proposals.  In the past when the President has fully utilized his popularity--on such issues as Reciprocal Trade and the Bricker Amendment--he has generally had his way.  The President has shown that he is not just whistling for immigration reform; he should now demonstrate that he will work for it.</span></p>"}

{"title": "College Political Clubs:  Activity, For a Change | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It happens every four years.  Wars, depressions, heart attacks--none of these can prevent presidential elections from taking place.  Present intense speculation about Eisenhower's future plans, the number of accusations and counter-accusations, the New Hampshire primary less than three weeks away--all these are reminders that this November about 60 million voters will go to the polls to elect a President of the United States.</span></p> <p><span>Politicians throughout the country have already started making plans for the big push ahead, organizing booster clubs and trying to attract more people to take active part in the political parties.  Their efforts will almost certainly meet with some success, because traditionally the American people, often apathetic in off-year elections, suddenly become very concerned with politics when it becomes a question of electing a chief executive.</span></p> <p><span>The situation at the University promises to be no different from elsewhere.  Already three clubs have formed with the sole purpose of pushing the candidacy of a Presidential contender.  Most of the current interest seems directed toward Adlai Stevenson.  The Students for Stevenson Club already has 328 members, a figure far ahead of the other groups.  Eisenhower for President supporters number slightly over 100, while the Kefauver booster club so far has only 25 supporters.  Furthermore, if Eisenhower decides not to run for reelection, it is a safe bet that many new clubs will form to back the candidacies of various Republican aspirants.</span></p> <p><span><b>Large-Scale Conventions</b></span></p> <p><span>But these new clubs, with ambitious hopes and plans for the future, have not completely stolen the initiative from the three permanent organizations at the University primarily interested in practical politics--the Young Republicans, the Young Democrats, and the Liberal Union.  Their tentative spring plans include discussions of topics and candidates for 1956 and, more important, two largescale conventions.  The Republicans are still uncertain about their convention which, President John R. Thompson '57 says, will be converted into a mock congress if Eisenhower decides to run.  The Democrats, however, have proceeded rapidly with plans for a large intercollegiate gathering to include representatives from about 70 colleges in May.</span></p> <p><span>As a general rule memberships of political clubs go through four-year cycles.  In 1952, for instance, the HYRC had 200 more members than it does today.  The HLU's membership has also fallen drastically since that election year.  The one club to go against the trend has been the HYDC.</span></p> <p><span><b>Republicans Were Popular</b></span></p> <p><span>At present the Young Democrats have about 260 members, not including the Law School Democratic organization with another 100.  This is twice their 1952 figure.  The Young Republicans still have the most members with 385, but this is nothing like the predominant role they once enjoyed at the University.  Two weeks after the Club was founded in 1888, it already had 817 members.  In those days the Republicans had to rent a building in Boston to hold all the people who wished to attend their massive rallies.  One meeting, in Tremont Temple, attracted 4500 people.  In fact, the nearly even division of the University in 1952 between Eisenhower and Stevenson marked the first time in history, except for the freak 1912 split, that the Republicans did not overwhelmingly carry the school in the CRIMSON straw poll.</span></p> <p><span>Although the Democrats seem to contradict the general political scene with their rise in membership during non-election years, the HYDC has had the usual problem of a student apathy to overcome.  Membership figures give little indication of the number of participants.  Last Wednesday, for instance, less than one-fifth of the members attended an important HYDC election meeting.</span></p> <p><span>A variety of reasons are advanced for this generally weak show of political interest.  Christopher Niebuhr 56, former President of the HLU, suggests that perhaps students who were interested in hometown politics do not become equally engrossed in Cambridge and Massachusetts affairs.  The new HLU President, Joseph E. Frank '56, gives another reason.  \"Students are more concerned with studies and social life than with extra-curricular activities and political organizations,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>The most highly regarded way of keeping up interest in non-election years--and the best way to keep an organization in the public limelight--is a good speaker program.  Even in 1892 this fact was realized.</span></p> <p><span>In that year, the Republicans had a gala public meeting in Boston, with reserved seats in Tremont Temple.  The Rev. Edward Everett Hale presided over a collection of notables which included Henry Cabot Lodge, Theodore Roosevelt, and Elihu Root.</span></p> <p><span><b>Sucess or Failure</b></span></p> <p><span>The organization of most of the clubs depends upon the executive boards, the real focal point of all activity.  They are the groups which determine the success or failure of a club.  \"Every organization is run by a small group of students who are willing to work.\"  Frank concedes.</span></p> <p><span>Since positions on the executive boards determine the direction and power of an organization, elections for these offices often result in bitter contests.  Last year there were repeated charges after a HYRC election of \"corruption,\" \"bribes,\" and \"ugly threats.\"  The HYDC was almost ruined before it began, in the 1952 campaign, when a pair of Southern Democrats tried to split the club after they had lost an election, despite buying votes.  The rival Democratic Club, however, was not recognized by Dean Watson.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the activities of the clubs are of a much more normal nature.  Designed to sustain and increase the participation and interest of the members, such projects as club bulletins, discussion meetings, Wellesley mixers, beer parties, and political tables, have admirably served their purpose.  Charles L. Edson '56, past president of the HYDC maintains that his club has \"tried to get down to the members, to incorporate more students into the clubs activities.\"</span></p> <p><span>The HYRC has been the most successful in this respect, with its newspaper and freshmen workshops.  The <i>Harvard Times-Republican</i> has weekly presented a platform for expressing the Republican viewpoint of the news, and has allowed many club members to help formulate this viewpoint.</span></p> <p><span>Lack of interest in political organizations was not always a problem at the University.  The following account of a Harvard Republican Club excursion to Washington, D.C., to the inauguration celebration of Theodore Roosevelt in 1905 presents quite a contrast to the current status of political activity:</span></p> <p><span>\"We hired an entire house, perhaps two houses, on a side street, filled the rooms with beds, and occupied it for two days and nights.  We went down and back by special train...  There were from 200 to 300 in the parade.  Our group worked in caps and gowns, behind a large Harvard banner.  After the parade the group countermarched in a body to the White House, and there was tendered a reception by the President on the portico.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nowadays, political clubs are more interested in constructive action.  In 1952, for instance, the Harvard Liberal Union, working in conjunction with several members of the faculty in a nationwide Civil Liberties Appeal, helped raise over $14,000 in a futile effort to unseat two main \"opponents of civil liberties,\" Republican Senators William Jenner of Indiana and Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin.</span></p> <p><span>While the club presidents themselves realize that the influence of a college organization upon the candidacy of a major candidate is very hard to measure, concentrated effort by a few dozen workers in a local election can easily prove the difference between victory and defeat.  The Liberal Union has worked upon this theory, and aided the election in the fall of 1954 of Sumner Kaplan to the State Legislature, the first Democrat ever elected in Brookline.</span></p> <p><span><b>Ringing Doorbells</b></span></p> <p><span>Much of the most important work consists of doorbell ringing, to get people registered to vote, and then to get people them out to vote.  The Students for Stevenson Club is now in the process of preparing detailed information about registration and absentee ballots to residents of the five states, Minnesota, Florida, California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, in which its candidate is entered in the primaries.</span></p> <p><span>The Kefauver for President Club is the only other club which has pre convention campaign plans, since the HYDC, HLU, and HYRC are prohibited, by the nature of their affiliation with national organizations, from supporting pre-convention candidates.</span></p> <p><span>A New Conservative Club also exists, but its founder and former president, William Brady '57, says that the organization will not campaign for candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Once the actual campaign starts in September, however, every club interested in practical politics will go into action.  The only ones with a definite scheme in mind will be those supporting a Presidential candidate.  The more permanent, more broadly based clubs, the HLU, the HYDC, and the HYRC, will have to decide which candidate to support actively.</span></p> <p><span>By virtue of its independent position, the Liberal Union has the most freedom in its choice of candidates.  Although it cannot oppose candidates supported by either the national or state ADA, the HLU is free to withhold support from whomever it wishes, and can designate the specific men it wishes to aid.</span></p> <p><span>After the issue of supporting candidates is decided the clubs settle down to the less spectacular task involved in political campaigning.  Perhaps the best organized club for political action in 1952 was the HYDC, whose president, Stan Tobin, had worked long and hard in the summer planning for the campaign.  He had police type maps of every precinct of Cambridge, and developed a system of methodically covering as much of the area as possible.  Despite its small membership, the HYDC attracted the greatest number of workers during the autumn months.</span></p> <p><span>Since it is chiefly in the few months of actual campaigning that a political organization can do any real good, it sometimes seems that a club should be in existence only during those months.  However, without maintaining a continuous undercurrent of interest in the political ideals it supports, can hardly hope for a spontaneous outburst of assistance during election years.</span></p> <p><span>The political clubs, with such projects as the two mock conventions and pre-campaign preparation for next fall, will be the vehicle for renewed political interest to manifest itself again.  The remainder of this term will see continuing ground work activity in anticipation of the big push next fall, when again the political arena will dominate the country and the University</span></p>"}

{"title": "Eisenhower and Natural Gas | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When the Eisenhower Administration rode into Washington three years ago, it came to power with a long-standing identification with business interests and some general ideas on the allocation of the nation's natural resources.  In hectic succession, the President proposed measures to return the Tidelands to state control, to bypass the authority of the T.V.A., and to sell of government-owned synthetic rubber plants.  Before Saturday, Mr. Eisenhower will have one more opportunity to oppose government interference with the workings of private industry, when he decides whether or not to sign the controversial Natural Gas bill.</span></p> <p><span>Passed last week by the Senate amid intense lobbying, the Harris-Fulbright amendment to the 1938 Natural Gas Law would, in effect, exempt producers of natural gas from government regulation.  Under existing legislation, the Federal Power Commission has regulated gas production at the wellhead, with the \"primary aim of preventing exploitation of consumers.\"  But supporters of the bill maintain that these regulations curtail the profits of the nation's more than 5000 gas producers--most of them relatively small--discouraging them from seeking vital new reserves.  The real violators of the consumer's interest, according to Senator Fulbright of Arkansas, sponsor of the bill, are the pipe-line companies who collect 90 cents from every dollar spent for gas by the householder.  The amendment, he claims, would stimulate new industries based on an increased supply of natural gas and enable the producer to have a bigger share of his own pie.</span></p> <p><span>While proponents of the bill, both Republicans and Democrats, maintain that the national interest demands an increased incentive to foster a continuing search for new gas fields, many Senators fear that a removal of regulation would drastically harm consumers.  This increase in rates would only add to the profits of the fewer than 200 large companies that supply most of the natural gas carried in interstate commerce.  Primarily involved in oil drilling, they receive bonanza profits from by-products without sizeable expenditures.</span></p> <p><span>Already favored by the President's 27 1/2 percent tax abatement to compensate for depletion and dry holes, these oil companies, unless regulated, can \"gouge\" the consumer with exhorbitant prices.  An increase of as little as two to five cents per million cubic feet could cost the consumer as much as $18 billion in the next twenty years.  If the consumer tires of Esso gasoline or Chesterfield cigarettes, he can change his purchases, but the 60,000,000 users of gas for refrigerators, ranges, and heating plants must pay whatever price the local gas company charges.  In addition, industrial production, much of which is now geared around using gas as a cheap, adaptable fuel, would suffer from any price rise.  The gas industry has become a monopoly and should, therefore, be regulated as a public utility, with its prices held to \"costs plus adequate reimbursement.\"</span></p> <p><span>If the President signs the natural gas bill, he will be furthering his by now well-defined policy of seeking a \"friendly partnership with private business.\"  His signature would be one more clear example of his Administration's willingness to support private industry, even at the expense of the consumer.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Segregating Integration | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As the Deep South settles down to face the tremendous problems of racial integration, the temptation increases on the part of eager politicians to exploit inevitable clashes for political gain.  Already, in the regrettable Miss Lucy affair, remarks by certain candidates for national office show that it is not difficult to turn the harsh noises from the South into appealing words for the Northern voter.  These statements are certain to damage the cause of interstatements are certain to damage the cause of integration, and if the candidates are unable to keep their discussion of the problem restrained, the whole subject of integration of schools should be removed from the coming Presidential campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Admittedly any judgment on political motives is difficult to make.  Stevenson and Eisenhower, by urging a moderate approach to the problem and by questioning the need for Federal action at this time, may be making as much of a play for the Southern vote as Harriman and Nixon are for the Northern urban vote.  Motives aside, however, when Harriman condemed the President for taking the riots over Miss Lucy \"so lightly,\" and when Nixon credited a great Republican Chief Justice with engineering the Supreme Court decision, the two Presidential aspirants did both their parties and the progress of integration great disservice.</span></p> <p><span>The statements of the four party leaders show clearly that opinions on integration do not divide along party lines.  Stevenson and Eisenhower are certainly closer on this question than either is to the less moderate elements in his own party.  And while Warren may be a \"great Republican,\" the Court's unanimous segregation decision clearly transcended party loyalties.  Even moderate spokesmen in the South itself are pretty much divided between Republicans and Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>Since party divisions are generally meaningless in a discussion of integration, it would be foolish indeed for either party to drag the problem into the political ring; it would also be extremely dangerous for the cause of integration, since integration will make progress as a legal, not as a political, issue.  Those working effectively for integration in the South are emphasizing not that the Court decision is right, but that it is now the supreme law of the land and must be obeyed.  Once the ruling on integration is lowered from its judicial pedestal, the decision will lose what sanctity it now has and the task of desegregating schools will become almost insurmountable.</span></p> <p><span>The Court certainly realized the prestige value of law when it left the implementation of the decision in the hands of the district judges.  In the same decree, Washington recognized another problem which is equal cause for keeping debates on integration out of politics--the innumerable local variations that preclude any one formula for successful desegregation.  Any candidate who commits himself to one road toward integration will probably find that his statements are pretty valueless when applied to any particular local situation.</span></p> <p><span>Not only would the statements have little value in the South, but they would, more importantly, hamper the future President's effectiveness when he has to deal with the problem.  As integration proceeds during the next few years, federal action may from time to time be necessary.  In any event, the President must not speak as the candidate who favored rapid integration or slow integration, but as a President who is administering the law.</span></p> <p><span>Naturally, if too many issues are banned from the coming electoral contest, there will not be much of a campaign.  But there are peculiarly sensitive problems involved in desegregation which demand that candidates either discuss the subject with utmost moderation or else avoid discussion entirely.</span></p>"}
{"title": "A Year of Crimson Politicking | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The CRIMSON found itself somewhat involved this year in the usual collegiate argle-bargle:  urging longer hours for female guests (in accord with the ideal of \"gracious living\"), advocating an additional mid-year vacation and drinking for 18-year olds, battling the Harvard Athletic Association for alcohol in the stands, tickets, and general principles.  Yet in the midst of the frivolity the CRIME somehow found time for serious consideration of a few major issues.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>College Expansion</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Expansion loomed as the major problem, and an essentially insoluble one.  While the CRIMSON'S efforts to clear up the problem were not entirely successful, a few general conclusions were reached.  Expansion, which seems to be approaching inexorably, must not undermine the most vital and distinctive features of Harvard education:  the tutorial system, adequate library facilities, and, most important, adequate housing space to provide for concentrated private study.  To preserve these valued institutions while recognizing the inevitability of enlargements, the University must do some really long-range planning.  Meanwhile, expansion aside, an eighth house is absolutely necessary.</span></p> <p><span>Of only slightly less importance is the need for a new hygiene building and a theatre.  The need for a theatre became especially apparent in a year in which there were often four student productions a week.  Although some fear that a new theatre would result in \"professionalism\" in college drama, it was generally agreed that Harvard ought nevertheless to have one.</span></p> <p><span>In spite of the pressing need for an eighth house, a hygiene building, a theatre, and other improvements amounting to 40 million dollars, there has been a general tendency to feel that all was pretty much all right at Harvard, while all was not quite right with the world.  Several sighs of relief were breathed throughout the year as people became increasingly aware of the passing of the McCarthy menace.  We felt, however, that precautions must be taken for the future:  Eisenhower's provision for an impartial board to handle security hearings was considered an improvement, but youthful and quite justifiable idealism still yearns for direct confrontation of witness by the accused civil servant.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Foreign Policy</i></b></span></p> <p><span>The most disturbing national problem, however, has seemed to be the failure to develop a foreign policy to match Russia's \"new look.\"  Toward this, the CRIMSON urged an increase rather than a withdrawal of trust in the UN, as well as the extension of multi-lateral long-term aid, and an increased interest in Asia, Africa, and Latin America:</span></p> <p><span>\"It is a sad commentary on American politics...that appeals for long-term aid must be based on Soviet actions.  The need for U.S. aid would be just as compelling without any threat from the Soviet Union...\"</span></p> <p><span>Although the CRIMSON realized that the Geneva Conference did not signalize a change in basis Soviet aims, it was generally felt that personal pledges not to begin a third--and last--world war were important gains and that a continual creative approach in diplomacy indicated by the atoms-for-peace and \"open skies\" disarmament plan, was after all the best one.  Thus, it urged that a realistic view of Soviet aims need not prevent the development of East-West contacts:  trade with Russia in non-strategic materials and the exchange of professors and students between the two countries, as well as the avoidance of automatic skepticism, were stressed.  \"The type of label-thinking which has characterized this country's official view towards the Soviet Union is becoming too costly to maintain.  There is a certain stage at which open hostility and cynicism begins to pay diminishing returns...  Perhaps the current American reaction of automatic skepticism towards everything that Russia does or says or promises is a natural after-effect of the Great Awakening,the days when the U.S. first recognized the meaning of Stalin's smiles.  From an unjustified good faith in Russia's intentions, America leaped into fear and a deep contempt for the new enemy, instead of assuming a proper attitude of caution and watchful reserve...  In reaction to Soviet offers to confer, the U.S. answers with despairing pessimism instead of cautious optimism.  When Russia announced her arms cut, Secretary Dulles, a man of few and ill-chosen words, responded that \"the obvious explanation\" is as a propaganda tactic and a shift of manpower to industry and agriculture....  This kind of narrow pre-judgement of Russia with which the U.S. faces the world can do this country little good.  It is perhaps more dangerous than naivete, because it characterizes America as stubborn, dogmatic, and incredulous...\"</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Ike, Dulles, Nixon</i></b></span></p> <p><span>If the point of view expressed above, with its emphasis on fluidity, indicates the reason for CRIMSON'S strictures on a most rigid J.F. Dulles, a certain lack of backbone was its main criticism of vice-president Dick Nixon, the Achilles heel of the Republican Party.</span></p> <p><span>\"Obviously, he now supports the Eisenhower legislative program, but it is virtually impossible to point to a single substantive policy in the past three years that has been his own.  The combined lack of creative leadership and of consistent political principle make Nixon's opportunism dangerous to Eisenhower Republicanism and to the nation....  Eisenhower's statesmanship has been the kind that can unify a nation, Nixon's antics are intensely partisan.  Eisenhower's policy has been generally liberal; Nixon's real policy is totally elusive.  As a quick-change artist of the worst sort, Nixon's entire political career makes current support for Eisenhower's Republicanism highly questionable....\"</span></p> <p><span>In the general political analysis presented by the specter of Dulles' stolidity and Nixon's serpentine behavior, Eisenhower, despite his illness, appears a most creative leader.  This appears in his proposals for the segregation problem--moderate, but forceful, action and the establishment of bi-racial commissions.

Yeats who encouraged Johnston on the playwright's path.  The Professor has carefully preserved the manuscript of his first Abbey play complete with Yeats' carefully written comments and corrections.  Seven plays followed the first Johnston drama, \"The Old Lady Says No,\" but the writer likes best his second play, \"The Moon in Yellow River.\"  This summer he hopes to complete another drama with a background of the Irish Revolution.  Like many Irish playwrights, Johnston has a superstition which prevents talk about a play not yet published.  \"Irishmen feel if you talk too much about a play, there's a fair chance it will never see print,\" he explains.</span></p> <p><span>Last winter, on leave from Mount Holyoke College where he is professor of English, Johnston returned to Dublin to collect data for a biography of Dean Swift which he is completing under a Guggenheim Fellowship.

He has not only written plays but acted in them and directed them, notably at the Gate Theatre in Dublin and on this side of the ocean at the Province-town Playhouse and the Amherst Theatre Festival.  He has high praise for the Poets' Workshop Theatre here, and is very much in favor of repertoire theater, since it gives the playwright a chance to see his work enacted and to revise it.</span></p> <p><span>The current widespread interest in Irish literature and the popularity of his Summer School course on the subject are no surprise to Johnston.  The Professor singles out James Joyce as the greatest prose writer of the twentieth century.  He feels that the literary scene in Ireland today lacks an authoritative spokesman because the new Republic hasn't yet made up its mind what it is going to be.  This situation is good, Johnston feels, because it indicates that the fulfillment of his country still lies in the future.</span></p>"}

{"title": "All That Glitters... | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Under the aegis of \"prosperity,\" the Republican party sits complacently promising four more years of the same.  The GOP proudly points to neatly balanced columns of figures and shinier cars and silver-plated doorknobs, and defies denial that the horn of plenty is overflowing.  Although the Republican boast seems at first justified, when the figures are inspected and the plating is scraped away there remains a clouded picture of deception, illusion, and statistical manipulation.</span></p> <p><span>The President boasts of record National Incomes, but fails to indicate that National Income is not necessarily, per se, an indication of prosperity.  Examine a year in the midst of the Eisenhower reign, 1954, a year for which there are statistics available and one which hindsight can interpret.  In 1954, in the midst of Republican \"prosperity,\" the country produced the all-time record national debt of 275 billion dollars, greater than any during the Second World War.  Although the debt is necessary, an abnormally high debt behind great government spending is no base for the national economy.  Frantic hacking at the Federal budget and expense juggling failed to reduce that colossal figure by any substantial amount.</span></p> <p><span>A cursory look at the budget reveals the reason for this debts, and also sheds needed light on the National Incomer figure for the year 1954.  The GOP revels in the whopping National Incomes over the past four years.  In 1954 the total amounted to almost $300 billion.  But National Incomes is total of public and private expenditures.  The Government's expenditure for 1954 was over $35 billion, the highest it had been since the war year of 1954.  This figure excludes military expenditures, which chalked up another $40 billion.  These military costs remained abnormally high, despite a complete revamping of our defense policy in order to slice the Army's expenditure.</span></p> <p><span>The other side of the coin, private expenditure, came to an overwhelming $236 billion, which the GOP loudly hearalds as an indication that Rich America is growing richer and the standard of living is skyrocketing.  The private debt for 1954, unfortunately, soared to its highest point in history.  The non-farm debt reached an all-time peak, and the farm debt exceeded any since the bleak days of 1932.  Naturally, the more you borrow the more you can spend.  Under this truism, the Government and the public borrowed and spent more than they ever had before.</span></p> <p><span>For the public, debts resulted from frenetic spending and dangerously overextended credit.  Corporations rolled up the immense debts of $176 billion, while consumers came close to that total.  Business borrowed and built and produced, consumers borrowed and bought.  Most consumption and production was of new conveniences, gadgets, and luxury items.  This is proved by the 1954 business index, which shows durable good production dropping sharply, while non-durable production rises.  Prices of these consumer items also rose to record heights, explaining the record consumer expenditures.</span></p> <p><span>Spending on credit is necessary for the Government, for business, for the farmer, and for the public.  But credit cannot be extended to the point where it replaces actual, produced wealth.  It cannot, by itself, maintain real prosperity.</span></p> <p><span>Republican \"prosperity\", then, appears compounded of such vaporous stuff as loose credit, enormous debts, immense government costs, high prices, and a plethora of nonessential consumer items.  Upon these deceptive indications of illusory wealth, the GOP now seeks another four years of power.  On this record of manipulated facts the Party claims National prosperity.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever prosperity does exist does certainly not apply to the nation as a whole.  There are pockets of unemployment, glossed over in Republican campaign speeches; there are farmers whose debts and costs are higher, and whose incomes are lower, than they have been since the Depression; there are innumerbable small businesses that are struggling desperately to stay above water, caught between high taxes and high costs.  Thus, while small business strains and the farmer sweats and the unemployed look elsewhere, the GOP shouts of a new era of gliter and polish.</span></p> <p><span>If this be prosperity, it is lying upon far from solid foundations.  It smacks of the old formula, Prosperity=Waste, Borrow, Produce, Spend, Waste.  It is to be hoped that the President, in his campaign, will speak of \"prosperity\" in analytical and candid, rather than boastful, terms.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Ike, McKay and the Giveaway | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Election of a trout-fishing President in 1952 must have encouraged conservationists and those who favor orderly development of natural resources.  After all, the G.O.P. was the party of Theodore Roosevelt, of Gifford Pinchot, and of George Norris, all pioneers in the conservation field.  And Eisenhower's selection of Douglas McKay as Secretary of the Interior might even have seemed auspicious, for McKay, while Governor of Oregon, had favored federal development of a high multi-purpose dam at Hells Canyon.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, the current regime's 1952 campaign failed to suggest any rich heritage of conservation.  Instead Eisenhower promised to hand over the Federal government's vast offshore oil reserves to a few states.</span></p> <p><span>Nor did natural resources fare any better when Eisenhower actually came to power.  The President stoutly defended all aspects of the Dixon-Yates deal, an affair so disreputable that even Ike-liker John Sherman Cooper opposed it.  A complicated issue, the Dixon-Yates proposals included obvious attempts to whittle down TVA and to encircle it with a giant utilities holding company.  And the President, not normally prodigal with his immense influence, worked as hard to defeat the Hells Canyon dam as he worked on any other bill in four years.</span></p> <p><span>These three issues, by and large, were the ones with which the President concerned himself.  He did veto the Natural Gas Bill although for the wrong reasons.  Otherwise he \"roughed it\" in the Rockies and even managed to upset the angling fraternity by taking 40 trout without a licence in a single day.  He left natural resources under the infrequently benevolent hands of McKay who eventually resigned to run for the Senate against Wayne Morse.  Fred Seaton replaced McKay, and continued his predecessor's policies.</span></p> <p><span>McKay's record is not all bad.  His projected Mission 66 for the National Parks is constructive, and the Parks have received more funds under this Administration than previously.  He has sold some dispensable, scattered public lands, and he and Secretary of Agriculture Benson sometimes stepped in to prevent wanton timbering on the public domain.  McKay also protected the world's last 28 whooping cranes by blocking an Air Force plan to practice night photoflash bombing near the cranes' refuge.</span></p> <p><span><b>'Partnership' in Power</b></span></p> <p><span>Cranes need protection, but so do natural resources, and McKay, Eisenhower and a private-power-stacked Federal Power Commission have substituted \"partnership\" for careful development of hydroelectric potential.  \"Partnership\" is a policy with chameleon tendencies, but essentially it can mean:</span></p> <p><span>1) Government encourages private industry to develop a dam site by itself or</span></p> <p><span>2- Government and private industry share the expense of a dam, with government retaining control of all nonpower aspects, while the company sells the power.</span></p> <p><span>The most obvious results of this policy are shown in the Pacific Northwest, where McKay withdrew Interior Department support for a high federal dam at Hells Canyon.  Then the FPC ignored its examiner, who had found that a high dam would provide more power, more flood control, more navigation, and more recreation for the Hells Canyon area than the three low private dams.  The FPC granted permission for the three-dam plan.</span></p> <p><span>McKay and the Commission have consistently opposed Federal dams, despite the fact that substitute private dams are less productive in most aspects, and rarely take any notice of comprehensive development plans prepared for the areas in question.</span></p> <p><span>This is not to argue public power to the exclusion of private power.  But private companies are frequently unable to utilize a dam site fully, and wasting the heritage of future generations in this respect is inexcusable.  These federal projects pay for themselves through power revenues, and the experience of TVA and the Bonneville Power Administration shows that they stimulate the area's economy so it can pay a larger share of the nation's taxes.</span></p> <p><span>The Democrats have not been perfect on the issue, either, but the dominant element in the party swung 83 per cent of the Senate Democratic vote for Hells Canyon, while 96 per cent of the Republicans, under Eisenhower pressure, opposed it.</span></p> <p><span>The Administration has opened Wildlife Refuges to oil drilling, while McKay was publicly announcing it would be forbidden.  Appropriations for the Rural Electrification Administration and the Bonneville Power Administration were drastically cut.  The Rogue River National Forest has been lumbered extensively under a phony mining contract.  The Administration backed a bill to give lumber operators choice public forest lands instead of cash compensation when their properties were condemned for reservoirs or similar purposes.</span></p> <p><span>America's natural resources are strictly limited, and their preservation requires a careful, foresighted use of them.  For hydro-electrical potential and public lands, for wildlife and fisheries management, for all the resources under the public domain, the America of tomorrow requires that we turn our backs on the wasteful ways of today, that we hold firm to what remains and use it wisely in the years to come.</span></p>"}

{"title": "An End to Pusillanimity | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The struggle for integration in the past has often seemed a test of how much rebelliousness national leaders would permit the South.  Generally, tensions there being what they are, it was felt that the best possible course would be to keep quiet and let the years somehow transform the South's attitude.  The platforms of both parties this year, accordingly, were carefully designed to say nothing about the whole issue.</span></p> <p><span>The hope that integration would proceed smoothly if everyone (and especially the NAACP) kept quiet was blighted, however, when the opening of school resurrected the issue with renewed intensity at Mansfield, Clay, and Sturgis.  Since that time each of the candidates has come out with his own appeal to the integrity of the South.</span></p> <p><span>President Eisenhower's bid turned out to be a gem of political strategy.  The President diplomatically stated:</span></p> <p><span>\"I think it makes no difference whether or not I endorse it (the Supreme Court decision) ... the Constitution is as the Supreme Court interprets it; and I must conform to that....\"</span></p> <p><span>This statement is perhaps one of the President's shrewdest moves since his election--leading people to wonder just how much of a politician the innocent General has become--but it holds out hope to the South that it is morally right and leads it to believe that the whole matter is, after all, one of political caginess.</span></p> <p><span>Since the President is one of the few national politicians respected in the South, this dodging of moral issues is perticularly disastrous.  For only a man of his stature can hope directly to persuade the South to begin recognizing the Court's decision.  If Ike would not stand up for what he felt was obviously right, the South could certainly feel that it had license to fight for its own twisted principles.</span></p> <p><span>In the light of Ike's timidity, the statements made recently by Stevenson (hitherto considered the clever and cautious politician) seem especially startling.  Last spring the CRIMSON sharply criticized Stevenson for shilly-shallying--his moderation seemed to have only political motives.  But his attitudes this fall indicate that moderation, with him, is a matter of principle, for his stand is firm.  The first indication of this was in his judgment on the most recent incidents which he termed \"a disgrace to Democrats, a disgrace to Republicans, and a disgrace to the nation.\"  But his latest statement at Little Rock carried his firmness, reserved by most politicians for the North, deep into the camp of the Citizen's Councils:  \"The Supreme Court ... has determined unanimously that the Constitution does not permit segregation in the schools...  I believe that decision to be right.  Some of you feel strongly to the contrary....\"  This statement was no doubt aimed as much at Northern newspaper readers as at the Arkansans who happened to be present.  But, meanwhile, its successful reception suggested that the Southerners, or at least a large segment of them, might well respond nationally to honesty and a little grit.</span></p> <p><span>Apparently, serious confrontation by respected leaders, attempted before only by Stevenson in 1952 (before the Supreme Court decision), may have some effect in turning the tide of attitude in the South.  By daring a most unfavorable reaction, Stevenson has managed to break new ground on the integration problem, even in the midst of a touch-and-go campaign.  As yet there has been no similar Republican effort in this direction.  Nixon's statement that he is an honorary member of the NAACP seems calculated only to rile a South which still holds itself proud.  Certainly Nixon's approach can have no constructive effect.  But the President is capable of a dignity which might possibly carry off an Eisenhower version of Stevenson's \"direct confrontation.\"  It remains to be seen whether President Eisenhower will take advantage of this new victory of attitude over the South's carefully cultivated irrationality.</span></p>"}

Roosevelt died in office, Truman said he had \"experienced the confusion and difficulty that comes when a President dies in office, and aside from purely personal considerations, I thought it wrong to let the government run that risk.  So I walked out while I could still walk, and I have never regretted it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Truman spoke last night to a capacity crowd of nearly 2000, made up principally of MIT and Harvard students and faculty in MIT's Auditorium.  His talk was sponsored by the Law School Forum and the MIT Lecture Series.</span></p> <p><span>Comparing the illness of Eisenhower last year with that of President Woodrow Wilson in 1919-1920, Truman said \"the provisions of the Constitution governing the succession of the Vice-President are not spelled out in detail, and the illness or incapacity of a President can be more dangerous even than his death.</span></p> <p><span>\"We had such a problem in President Wilson's last year, and much harm resulted from it.  It would have been immeasurably worse if President Wilson's death had occurred during the course of the war or in a period of great crisis.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"There is only one way\" to carry out the duties of the Presidency, Truman said, \"and that is to keep everlastingly at them, and to give as much time to them as it is possible to squeeze out of every 24 hours.\"  The former president attacked proposals to lighten the burdens of the post, stating that \"if the President lets things drift, the country is in danger, for drifting is the easy road to disaster.\"</span></p> <p><span>In his discussion of the Presidency, Truman said the job is \"really five or six jobs,\" and he proceeded to talk about each one, often breaking away from his prepared text to jab at the Republicans, to the obvious delight of the many partisans in the audience.</span></p> <p><span>He drew his most vigorous applause when he spoke about the duty of acting as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.  \"He assigns commanders,\" and also, \"He can take them out.\"  This was an obvious reference to his transfer of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur from the command of the U.N. troops in Korea, a move which provoked much discussion in 1951.</span></p>"}

He also believed that Hand would not accept the appointment.</span></p> <p><span>Most of those interviewed agreed with Rodell that Hand \"would have been an excellent choice twenty years ago.\"  Schneider stated that the judge's appointment fifteen years ago \"would have added lustre to the court.\"  Bittker called him \"the most eminent living American judge.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Hastie Choice Approved</b></span></p> <p><span>The reactions of the six law experts to the suggestion of appointing Judge William Hastie, first Negro judge of a U.S. Court of Appeals, to the Supreme Court, varied as widely as their feelings toward Hand's appointment.

{"title": "Trade Tactics | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Until last Thursday special licenses from the Department of Foreign Commerce were required to export Easter egg dye, hair tonic, dentures, and baby bibs to the Soviet Union.  these and 700 other significant non-strategic commodities are now absolved from the licensing requirement and may be freely shipped to the Soviet bloc by American traders.  By this action the Administration is attempting to pacify domestic exporters and foreign especially British, critics who have been charging the U.S. with obstructing world trade and have been agitating for increased U.S. commercial relations with Russia.</span></p> <p><span>The Administration's condescension cannot pass as a real attempt to increase the volume of this country's trade with the Soviet bloc.  Non-strategic goods previously requiring licenses for export were granted them almost automatically.  No shortening of the \"strategic\" list has occurred.  Commerce Secretary Weeks states that the action is a step towards meeting President Eisenhower's Geneva objective, \"to create conditions which will encourage nations to increase the exchange of peaceful goods throughout the world.\"  But the little progress that the new change will make is, as U.S. exports claim, actually infinitesimal.</span></p> <p><span>Increased U.S.-Soviet trade is desirable on several important counts.  If the free world is, as it seems, bound to accept a prolonged state of coexistence with the Soviet Union, healthier commercial intercourse between East and West will lead to a less tense and precipitous atmosphere.  Rehabilitated US-USSR trade would also allow other non-Soviet nations to relax their trade relations with the Soviet bloc, and could provide them with new markets free of the prohibitive dollar-gap difficulty.</span></p> <p><span>The U.S. traders desire to deal with the USSR is shown by the rise in licensing applications over the past few years.  From $1,776,000 in 1951, the value of these requests jumped to $8,788,543 in 1955.</span></p> <p><span>The real barriers to increases in US-Soviet trade far surpass licensing requirements.  The \"strategic\" classification itself is so stringent as to prohibit exportation of anything Russia seeks to import.  In addition to keeping out of the USSR anything helpful to Soviet military potential, export controls also ban commodities which could in any long-run, remote way be useful to Red industrial development.  Naturally Russia has little yearning for baby bibs and dentures, so there are declared non-strategic.  With supply and demand stubbornly entrenched back to back, US-USSR trade had consequently dwindled to practically nothing.  An unencouraging US official attitude insures the total paralysis of US-Soviet trade.</span></p> <p><span>To eliminate these obstacles the Administration must yield considerably.  It must change its strategic classifications to release commodities which do not directly and significantly contribute to Soviet strength.  Accompanying these releases should be a stipulation tying Soviet purchase demands to American export items, to compel Russia to accept consumer items if she is to receive newly-released goods from the U.S.</span></p> <p><span>Before any effective increase occurs, the U.S. will have to show itself willing to initiate significant measures to release the cramp in East-West commerce.  The latest \"relaxation\" is nothing but a scrap thrown to clamoring critics in an effort to pacify them.  Much more will have to be done before the Administration can pose as anxious to thaw frozen channels of trade.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Flag Still Flies | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\"I guess I'm a conservative,\" says University Professor Zechariah Chafee, Jr. of the Law School, \"because I believe in the Constitution.\"  Retiring this June after nearly four decades of legal study, practice, and teaching, Chafee looks back on a career dedicated to that firs belief in the principles and guarantees of the Constitution.</span></p> <p><span>A descendant of early New England settlers, including Roger Williams, Chafee was born in Providence R.I. on December 7, 1885.  He was raised there and attended the town's university.  At Brown, which the left in 1907 carring a Phi Betta Kappa Key, a <i>summa</i> citation, and an A.B., Chafee's chief interests were writing and Latin translation.  In fact, he considers his two greatest achievements to be drafting the Federal Inter-pleader Act of 1934 and translating the anonymous Latin Poem <i>Pervigilium Veneris</i> while at Brown.  After a few years of working for his father's manufacturing firm, reading Blackstone, and being bored, Chafee decided to go to Harvard Law School.  He had always wanted to write and his work on the <i>Brunonian,</i> Brown's literary magazine, had given him the opportunity to do so, but he was running out of material.  In his study of law Chafee found a great untapped subject which was to become his lifelong interest--civil rights.  The guaranteed liberties of the American citizen gripped Chafee's imagination and became the material for intense exploration.  From these first intellectual groping came such monumental work as <i>Freedom of Speech</i> (1920), <i>America Now</i> (1938) and <i>Free Speech in the United States</i> (1941).</span></p> <p><span>After three years of practice in the Providence firm of Tillinghast and Collins, Chafee returned to Harvard to teach civil rights in the Law School.  Among his first students were such incipient barristers as Dean Acheson, Joseph N. Welch, and Archibald MacLeish.  Chafee hopes his lectures \"did they no harm.\"  Since 1919 Chafee, in the capacity of full professor, has preached the primacy of the First Amendment, its defense and its preservation.</span></p> <p><span>Anxious to promote his Cause at every opportunity, Chafee has served on many private and public bodies investigating freedom of the press and speech.  In the late twenties he acted as counsel to the National Committee on Law Observance and Enforcement.  Form 1943 to '47 Chafee, along with Jacques Maritain, Harold Lasswell, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Rheinhold Niebuhr, and Archibald MacLeish, served on the Freedom of the Press Committee, a private group sponsored by Henry Luce to investigating the extent of freedom of the press in the U.S. When the Committee started investigating Luce, the publisher stopped attending meetings and thereafter dropped by only for cocktails.  The Committee's members explore their Personal philosophies together, finally produced six books, among them Ohafee's now classic law text, <i>Government and Mass Communication.</i></span></p> <p><span>In 1948 as U.S. delegate to the U.N. Social and Economic Conference in Geneva, Cahfee made a speech inquiring why a Czech friend of his was at the first meeting of the conference but absent from the second.  Incidentally alluding to the Russian coup of the week before in Czechoslovakia, Chafee lamented the fact that the Czechs were not represented at the Conference.  The speech, he recalls, made the Reds feel uncomfortable for the remainder of the session.  Chafee was told not to become too intimate  with the Russian delegate.  \"I'm not too well built to do what I'm told though,\" he comments, \"and a Red delegate, Lomarkin, and I developed a strong personal friendship.  We dined together often and got to know all the good spots in Geneva.\"</span></p> <p><span>Commenting on current politics, Chafee believes Stevenson to be \"the most qualified man for the job that I have seen in my lifetime.\"  \"I can't remember him,\" he muses, \"But I've probably taught him.\"  \"Stevenson,\" says Chafee, \"has more of the qualities that make a great President than of those which enable a man to be elected.\"  Chafee also has high regard for Eisenhower, but thinks that the President should, like himself, retire.  \"The job requires a man's full energy to do great things,\" reflects Chafee, \"and the President just hasn't got that much energy left.\"</span></p> <p><span>Chafee now believes that the crisis in the threat to freedom of expression has passed.  Freedom shrinks only when fear grows and people today are less scared, he claims.  They are now better aware that they have been more scared than they ought to have been.  \"My great confidence in the American people, in their love of liberty and their good sense, makes me believe that their fits of tantrum about disloyalty among out fellow-citizens will end long before 1970,\" states Chafee in his forthcoming book, <i>The Blessings of Liberty.</i>  \"The blessings of liberty, though weakened, are ours if we want them, to hold and make strong.  The flag still flies, and the city has not yet fallen.\"</span></p> <p><span>Professor Arthur Sutherland, who, along with his son, was a pupil of Chafee's, lauds him as \"a man who all his life has stood for the free man in the free society.  He is in the forefront of the movement for human freedom throughout the world.\"  Zach Chafee intends to remain in this forefront after his retirement.  Although he will take more time out to enjoy boating, loud shirts, touring, and his eight grandchildren, Chafee plans to speak out more strongly than ever for the protection of freedom of expression.  In retirement, he feels, there will be opportunity to wield an aggressive lance in defense of this freedom.</span></p> <p><span>The terms \"liberal\" or \"conservative\" do not apply to Chafee.  \"My only wish, he maintains, \"is the constant desire to preserve what we started out with--the right to speak up and out.  Freedom of speech properly belongs to a people which is free from fear.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Latin Rhythms | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Americans have traditionally conceived of South America as a semi-dark continent, filled with languid Latins who occasionally excite themselves in unnecessary and harmless revolutions.  With this attitude prevailing in the United States, Latin America has been for the most part ignored, the State Department bestirring itself only when European powers appear about to take over.  Of late, American foreign policy has almost entirely been concerned with building a defense ring in Europe and Asia.  This is an undeniably necessary project, but the probability of holding the Asian line is at most doubtful.  Should much of our support in other hemispheres fail, the United States would have to fall back on its Southern neighbors as major allies.</span></p> <p><span>Since Latin America is the United States' natural relative both in point of geography and because it provides this country with more trade than any other single region, the State Department's non-military attitude seems rather myopic.  Latin America provides America with a large part of its oil, copper, lead, and bauxite, yet American foreign affairs experts have not instituted any long range plan to guard our interests.</span></p> <p><span>The recent development of Latin American trade with the Soviet bloc has made the United States' apathy seem indeed alarming.  The Soviets, less economically self-sufficient than the United States, are in some ways in a better position to trade with the Latins.  There are many South American products, such as Cuban sugar and Argentine grain and meat, which this country cannot use but which Russia can.</span></p> <p><span>The State Department can hardly create an American market for Argentine meat.  Nor can American industries be expected to make products cheaply enough to competes with the Czechs.  But inter-American relationships can be strengthened by a strong American interest and effective action in eliminating barriers to trade and in granting aid.  United States exporters at present employ a conservative and intractable credit system, a strong deterrent to countries which already have trouble meeting our inflationary prices.  Even more important, South American countries need capital and technical assistance to build the hydroelectric developments and highways which they vitally need.  In 1953 Milton Eisenhower, after touring South America, made a number of specific suggestions:  a stable and consistent trade policy, new tax laws encouraging investment in foreign countries, public loans, and technical help in economic planning.  In three years, however, nothing has been done to carry out this program.  Technical assistance to the twenty-one Latin American countries in 1953 amounted to only twenty-two million dollars.  In 1957, it will still be only sixtyone million.</span></p> <p><span>Increased economic assistance and more co-operative programs would, of course, be ideal, but the Latin American countries would be greatful for even less tangible signs of interest.  Milton Eisenhower's one visit worked a remarkable change in South American attitude toward the United States.  Argentina, for instance, turned overnight from hostility to equally fervid admiration.  But, aside from the one Eisenhower bid, little has been done to increase mutual understanding.  In spite of the Fulbright program and others, student, teacher, and labor leader exchange has been negligible.  Technical assistance has been almost equally lacking.  This is largely because neither the State Department nor the public in general seems to realize the growing importance of Latin America both as a supplier of non-military and strategic materials and as a future source of world power.</span></p>"}

Far from remedying the defects of the proposal, however, Congress seems bent on destroying the few aspects of the plan which show any semblance of constructive action.  The legislators have added so many restrictions to the President's discretionary powers that flexibility in the administration of foreign aid seems doomed.  This flexibility was the one saving grace of the proposal, for it at least permitted the United States to act with speed and decisiveness.  In limiting the President's authority in the field of foreign aid, the House Foreign Affairs Committee has voided his power to make long-term commitments, stop-gap emergency gifts, and loans to countries which hesitate to accept private investments from American companies.  In order to receive aid, a country like Iran would have to allow the return of those American oil companies which it previously expelled.  The committee halved the $40 million the President desired as his discretionary fund for expenditure on a single country.  It also cut the allotment for aid to the Middle East and Asia by $100 million.</span></p> <p><span>Almost every action the group has taken has been designed to increase legislative control over U.S. foreign aid.  The Congress must realize that projects such as dams and roads need a steady flow of funds rather than an unsure, year-to-year allotment.  Although the House committee's apparent distrust of the Administration's foreign <i>savoir faire</i> may be well-founded, it is nonetheless harmful to the conduct of international relations and to U.S. prestige.</span></p> <p><span>Fortunately, the actions of the House Foreign Affairs Committee are not final.  With active direction from the White House and leading Congressional liberals, increased flexibility and a stronger emphasis on economic assistance can be attained in order to cope with the Soviet threat and to regain the friendship of vital neutral nations.</span></p>"}
{"title": "John Foster Dulles--An Agonizing Reappraisal | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For a man who is supposed to have spent a large part of his life preparing for the Secretaryship of the U.S. State Department, John Foster Dulles has made a surprisingly large number of blunders.  Since his appointment in January, 1953, Dulles has probably done a more thorough job of lowering U.S. prestige and power than any Secretary of State in the recent past.</span></p> <p><span>To be fair to the President who appointed Dulles, one must begin with a disclaimer.  For in many ways, President Eisenhower himself has shown that when he takes the lead of his country's foreign affairs, resulting policies are usually creative and responsible.  The Atoms-for-Peace plan, last summer's Geneva Conference, and the scheme for mutual aerial inspection have all demonstrated that the President, when he chooses, can be a much more effective Secretary of State than his well-trained appointee.</span></p> <p><span><b>Eisenhower or Dulles?</b></span></p> <p><span>How Eisenhower has been able to stand by Dulles is difficult to understand.  At Geneva, the President showed that sincere personal discussions with Soviet leaders are worthwhile, but at Geneva a year earlier, the Secretary of State departed from the Indo-China Conference boasting that he had never once spoken to Chou En-Lai.  The President has called for positive reactions to petty Soviet moves, but the Secretary of State has responded to smallness with smallness--his retaliatory closing of 27 percent of U.S. territory to Russian nationals is typical.  The President has called for deeds and not words, but the Secretary of State has given forth a stream of words--from \"massive retaliation\" to \"agonizing reappraisal\" to \"liberation of the satellites\" to \"the Portuguese province of Goa\" to \"the brink of war\"--which have done far more to frighten our allies and our potential allies than to scare the Soviet Union.  The President has asked for close consultation between the U.S. and Britain and France, but the Secretary of State has released the Yalta Papers, announced U.S. Middle Eastern policy, and \"unleashed\" Chiang Kai-shek, without much more than a glance at Western Europe.</span></p> <p><span>It would be encouraging, indeed, to conclude that these verbal blunders and tactical errors constitute all of Dulles' mistakes, and that the substance of his policy is basically sound.  But for a Secretary of State who has travelled more miles than any previous Cabinet officer he shows remarkably little awareness of the world situation.</span></p> <p><span><b>McCarthy Muddle</b></span></p> <p><span>He might, in fact, have realized that his world begins in Washington, where State Department morale has probably come close to an all-time low under his administration.  At a time when Senator McCarthy was attacking the State Department, Dulles responded not with a strong defense of the loyalty of the Department, but with the firing of career diplomats like John Paton Davies Jr., and with the appointment of Scott McLeod as Department security officer.  And even since McCarthy's demise, Dulles has made no effort to begin a drastically-needed build-up process to make sure that when he leaves office, there will be a strong and creative Department--both in Washington and in foreign capitals.</span></p> <p><span>In Europe, Dulles has seemed pleased with his diplomacy, but perhaps forgets that since he took office, Yugoslavia has moved closer to the Soviet orbit, France has torpedoed the European Defense Community, West Germany has produced more proponents for reunification before rearmament, and England has become distressed at the lack of high level consultation on major policy decisions.  Dulles' responses to these situations, however, have been generally flexible and adequate, although the German problem is certainly far from solved.  And his recent statement that he now sees NATO must shift--slightly--into the economic and political spheres, is encouraging.</span></p> <p><span>While he has been relatively successful in Europe by carrying on inherited policies, he is making critical errors in other parts of the world.  He seems <b>to be</b> applying <b>somewhat outdated European</b> answers--large military expenditures and strong collective security pacts--to Asian, African, and South American questions that demand far different solutions.</span></p> <p><span><b>...In the East</b></span></p> <p><span>In the Far East, he talks mainly of Japanese military forces when Japan may very well join the neutrals if her economic dilemma remains unsolved.  He has staked U.S. prestige on the defense of two unimportant and indefensible islands off the Chinese coast, and he refuses to see that the U.S. must stop trying to overlook the existence of Communist China.</span></p> <p><span>In Southeast Asia, his SEATO is a defense treaty minus most nations in Southeast Asia.  It disregards facts which Indo-China should have demonstrated--that Communism in that part of the world must be fought with something in addition to rifles, that fear of European colonialism often blinds Asians to the new colonialism of China.  Moreover, by arming Pakistan, Dulles has upset the balance of power between India and Pakistan, and has forced Indian neutralism into a regrettable anti-U.S. attitude.</span></p> <p><span>In the Middle East, his scheme for a Northern tier alliance helped precipitate the latest Arab-Israel crisis and has provided an ineffective wall from Pakistan to Turkey which the Soviets seem to have taken some pleasure in jumping over.</span></p> <p><span>In Africa, he has been unable to devise a policy which strikes the necessary balance between support for European allies and encouragement of local independence.</span></p> <p><span><b>...In South America</b></span></p> <p><span>In South America, too, he has flown to conferences with resolutions against Communism and has flown away before the under-developed nations south of the border could talk about the trade and aid that will do more to protect the area than all his resolutions put together.</span></p> <p><span>In all of these actions by last year's \"Man of the Year,\" there has been a disturbing failure to recognize that new forces are at work demanding new and imaginative diplomacy.  Military regulars and deterrent atomic bombs are, indeed, indispenible; but this country's leaders must realize that people and ideas will--if they do not already--hold the time balance.</span></p> <p><span>This, Dulles has failed to do.  When he announces that Soviet tactics have changed from sneers to smiles because of American strength, he is open to criticism not merely as a Secretary of State who is careless with words, but more importantly, as one who fails to see that this country must rethink the future of its foreign policy.  There are men close to the Administration who do see the changes demanded:  Milton Eisenhower, John Sherman Cooper, Paul Hoffman, or Harold Stassen.  If John Foster Dulles is not replaced, however, his continuance in office is likely to loom as a major issue in the November election.</span></p>"}

Excerpts from the third lecture will appear tomorrow.  Reprinted by permission of the publishers from Chester Bowles, American Politics in a Revolutionary World, Cambridge, Mass.:  Harvard University Press, Copyright, 1956, by the President and Fellows of Harvard College.</b></span></p> <p><span><b>I</b></span></p> <p><span><b>A Theory of Political Development</b></span></p> <p><span>In this election year the attention of most Americans will be focused on the prospects of our two political parties.  A study of long-term political cycles may seem, therefore, academic and beside the point.</span></p> <p><span>Yet I believe that a consideration of these cycles will give us greater insight into the nature of our present alignment, help us to judge. more accurately the validity of current arguments, and even suggest, after a fashion, the course of our political development in the years ahead....</span></p> <p><span>My purpose is to consider whether and how our system can mobilize the creative political resources to deal effectively with the demands of the explosive new time in which we live.  I believe that to do so may require rather fundamental shifting and rearrangement in the present political alignment, not only of our two parties but in the deeper strata of public attitude which support and maintain them.  I shall concentrate, therefore, on the times and manner of such creative political responses in our past, to the neglect, perhaps, of other features of our political processes less relevant for the present purpose.</span></p> <p><span>From this point of view American political history may be usefully considered in terms of three great cycles or periods, each of which began with a burst of creative activity permeating a sizable majority of our people.  Each of these cycles began its response to the emergence of dynamic new economic and social problems for which the previous movement held no adequate answer.</span></p> <p><span>Each called forth not only new concepts of governmental responsibility but new political orientation on the part of a great many citizens.  Each accepted the economic and social changes which the earlier movement had produced in its period of creative energy, and moved on to develop new answers to the new challenge.  Each was identified in its earlier dynamic stage with a leader of great stature, with Jefferson, with Lincoln, and with Franklin Roosevelt.</span></p> <p><span>Each was launched in an atmosphere charged with surging enthusiasm and bitter partisanship, followed by a mellowing as the new concepts brought forth by the new conditions because more generally accepted and, ultimately, were adopted as basic objectives by both major political parties.</span></p> <p><span>I believe that we are now in the late stages of the third of these political cycles, and that a new one, calling for new alignments and a fresh burst of political imagination and creative leadership, may now be in the early phases of its development.</span></p> <p><span>Only a very brave or very foolish man would attempt, as this is written, to prophesy the outcome of the 1956 election.  But if I am correct in assuming that we are drawing towards the end of a political cycle, there are certain aspects of the approaching campaign which can be forecast with some confidence.</span></p> <p><span>For instance, those questions which later historians will certainly judge to be the most crucial of our time will not be the principal subjects of debate.  The campaign is likely to be fought for the most part on older and more familiar ground.</span></p> <p><span>The Democrats will be denounced as radical New Dealers who favor an overbearing federal government and creeping socialism.  Their proposals for a $1.10 minimum wage, increases in social security, and expanded slum clearance will be described as starry-eyed Utopianisms, derived from Marx or worse.  Their candidates will be labeled \"soft on communism.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Republicans will not get off much easier.  It will be said that they are reactionary successors to Herbert Hoover and may lead us into another Great Depression.  Proposals for a $.90 minimum wage, more moderate increases in social security, and more limited public housing will be characterized as timid, reactionary, and dictated by big-business interests.</span></p> <p><span>The Democrats, to defend themselves against the reproach of softness on communism, will be tempted to take a \"tough\" line on foreign policy issues; and the Republicans, in an effort to pour substance into the \"peace\" half of their \"Peace and Prosperity\" slogan, will call piously for a patient bipartisanship.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the political mayhem to which we can look forward in the coming months, there will be leaders in both parties, members of the press, and many citizens among the public at large who will sense in their hearts that these are clashes on the level of sloganeering, which do not reflect deeply felt rifts in national opinion.  Yet of those who sense the far more significant questions which are taking shape offstage, few will be able to articulate them.  And those who do will be warned by the experts that these questions are not profitable for election year debate.</span></p> <p><span>These prophecies are neither reckless nor novel.  Most of us are aware that the heat generated by our recent national election campaigns arises largely from conflicts only remotely related to the great issues around which the history of the second half of the twentieth century will ultimately be written.  We have become accustomed to this state of affairs, and only rarely do we bother to ask ourselves what can be done about it.</span></p> <p><span>We may even remind ourselves that this is not a new thing.  In 1928 the possibility of a world-wide depression of catastrophic proportions was not discussed.  In 1932, at the depth of the depression, Franklin Roosevelt preached economy and promised a balanced budget as the surest path to economic recovery....</span></p> <p><span>American political life, as I have suggested, can be seen in terms of a few relatively long periods, each dominated by a fairly stable coalition of the interests and factions Madison described--a semipermanent majority with a rough consensus on immediate public questions.  Each new coalition finds its instrument in one of the two major political parties.  Which one is determined by a complex interaction of traditions and loyalties, leadership and inspiration, strategy and accident.  Because that party is identified with a widely accepted view on current issues, it develops a commanding position in the national government.</span></p> <p><span>In the early phases of the cycle, when the new forces which created the new alignment are most dynamic and the public response most clear-cut, the electoral majorities of the dominant party may be overwhelming.  Although long voting habits may keep many who share the new majority viewpoint within the fold of the opposition party, in the beginning that party is commonly the haven for those who reject the new consensus.  The leaders of this group secure control of the party machinery and position it vigorously against the views widely accepted by the majority of citizens, thus consigning it to the role of semipermanent opposition.</span></p> <p><span>Repeated defeat at the polls, however, leads to an intraparty struggle in an effort to bring the minority party position into closer harmony with what is by now clearly identified as the broad majority view.  Meanwhile, as the majority party gains the policy objectives of the consensus it loses its momentum and the two parties grow closer together, each ultimately reflecting, though with important differences of attitude and emphasis, the general position of the underlying consensus among the public at large.</span></p> <p><span>In each of these long periods the minority party has been able of course to interrupt the rule of the majority party for short intervals.  Indeed, as the problems raised by new developments began to shoulder aside those earlier ones which gave form and shape to the movement itself, the interruptions tended to become more frequent.  As the maturing movement loses its fervor, new personalities may give the minority party temporary advantages; long years in office may lead to a lethargy and lowering of standards in the party which was first to identify itself with the general consensus.</span></p> <p><span>Yet a fundamental change in the direction of our government has always awaited the emergence of urgent and compelling new problems powerful enough to shatter the old majority-minority alignment.  Around these new questions has emerged a new consensus, a brilliant new leadership, and a new semipermanent division of the voters into majority and minority groups.  This new alignment is substantially altered from the one which preceded it, not only in its ideological reaction to the new challenge but also in its geographic and economic characteristics.  The new devision is invariably reflected in a shift in the nature, composition, or role of the two political parties.</span></p> <p><span>Now let us see whether we can really describe our political history in terms of this general pattern.</span></p> <p><span>This history, as I have suggested, may be divided into three periods of the type which I have described.  The ideological nature of the consensus that dominated each of these cycles cannot easily be summed up in a paragraph, much less in a phrase.  Each was complex, interwoven, and subject to constant changes in emphasis to meet current political pressures.</span></p> <p><span>Yet at the risk of oversimplification it may be said that the first, which extended from Jefferson's victory in 1800 to the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, was characterized by a general acceptance, for the first time in history, of an effective federal government closely responsive to the majority will,</span></p> <p><span>The second, which started in 1861 with Lincoln and ran until Franklin D. Roosevelt's election in 1932, imposed on this primary foundation a dynamic and uniquely American response to the Industrial Revolution, the broadening of civil rights, and the acceptance of corporations as a dominant factor in our economy.</span></p> <p><span>The third, which encompasses the period from 1932 to the present day, reflects a general acceptance of governmental responsibility for minimum standards of living and opportunity and for the full use of our human and capital resources within a system of private ownership.</span></p> <p><span>In the background normally accepted by all but a fringe of extremists, has been a still broader area of agreement on the ground rules under which the political struggle is conducted.  These ground rules indicate acceptance of the validity of the democratic process and the denial of the right of the majority unreasonably to impose its will on the minority.  On the one occasion when the minority opposing the general consensus in both parties attempted to change these ground rules, the result was civil war....</span></p> <p><span><b>II</b></span></p> <p><span><b>The New Deal Becomes Respectable</b></span></p> <p><span>By the outbreak of World War II, a large majority of the American people had reached far closer agreement on questions deeply affecting the public interest than their leaders realized.  Moreover, this consensus, or agreement, was not a result of the accompanying political debate, which indeed tended to conceal it.  Nor could it be viewed as a painfully worked out compromise between two relatively equal antagonists holding opposing views.</span></p> <p><span>The consensus, which in general supported the welfare state, had spread across the membership of both political parties.  In each party it was opposed by minorities which clung to older concepts of government and economics.  In the Democratic party, which had maintained itself in power after winning in 1932 by providing vigorous leadership for the new consensus and asserting the policy positions essential to its objectives, the minority was largely confined to certain sections of the South.  Here it was vocal and strong, but beyond the area of civil rights, in which seniority gave it a position of strength in the Senate, it was ineffective nationally.</span></p> <p><span>The anticonsensus minority in the Republican party, however, was able to play a more effective national role.  Although Republican candidates for President, recognizing the general popular support for New Deal measures, vigorously denied any intent to turn back the clock, the old guard was strong enough heavily to color the positions and pronouncements of their party.  As a result, the presence of a general agreement on the essentials of public policy in the prewar years was not apparent in the official party positions.  On the contrary, in the late 1930's and the early 1940's, just before our entry into World War II, the political arena bristled with sharply contested divisions between the leadership of the two parties along the entire range of policies, domestic and foreign.</span></p> <p><span>So close was the congressional division on foreign affairs that a whole series of critical measures leading up to our entry into World War II prevailed by a majority of twenty votes or less in the lower house.  In the case of the extension of the \"peacetime\" draft, three months before Pearl Harbor, the majority margin in the House of Representatives was a single vote.  Even today, the cries of indignation and alarm which may be heard constantly on both sides of the political fence seem to the casual observer to contradict any assumption of popular agreement.</span></p> <p><span>Yet these boilings and eruptions on the surface of our political life should not mislead us about the views of the rank and file of both parties and of the general electorate on what should be done and how we should go about it.  Although the feuding and the fighting have both their function and their useful consequences, they obscure, as often as they illuminate, the real character of the political alignment in the country at large.  For insight into this political development, we must look to what the parties actually do -- the means and measures they support when vested with the responsibility of office--not merely to the words which they use to chastise each other on the hustings.</span></p> <p><span>If, as I have maintained, a broad underlying public agreement on major issues started to develop in the early 1930's, under pressure of new forces, and was full-blown a decade later, why is it that this agreement has not been more clearly reflected in the behavior of the political parties?</span></p> <p><span>To begin to answer this question, it may be useful to examine in more detail the wide scope of disagreement which exists not only between the majority in each party which reflects the consensus and the minority in each party that opposes it but within the ranks of those who make up these divisions.  These differences are further intensified and distorted by election year conflicts, which often call forth the fierce expression of party loyalty and prejudice.</span></p> <p><span>There is, for instance, ample room for wide differences within the consensus in intensity of support for particular programs.  There is also room for differences about the measures best suited to carry out the broad purposes on which the majority has agreed.  A consensus which encompasses the objective of full employment can legitimately include those who would place primary emphasis on the encouragement of capital formation, as well as those who would favor measures designed to increase consumer purchasing power as means to the same end.  The Democrats may vigorously reflect one view; the Republicans, the other.</span></p> <p><span>A national consensus, then, as I see it, is no more nor no less than a rough working agreement on major propositions of policy.  Its bounds define, in effect, the area within which a compromise reached according to regularized procedures will be acceptable.  This means, generally, that the details of the compromise are left to be worked out on the formal political level, or even below it, by the institutions, groups, and individuals most intimately affected by the particular method chosen....</span></p> <p><span>Now let us examine these features at work since Pearl Harbor in our political system, particularly as they effect our present consensus and the position of our political parties in relation to it.</span></p> <p><span>....As we have seen, it is central to the thesis that each new majority alignment does not represent a rejection of the doctrine and values of the previous majority but rather envelops them and goes on to something else.  The Civil War was fought in the name of the Jeffersonian concepts expressed in the Declaration, and the welfare state was a modern reflection of Lincoln's concept of economic opportunity and growth as a prerequisite of freedom.</span></p> <p><span>For purposes of more closely defining our area of agreement today, as well as examining some of the divergencies within it, I propose to consider domestic policy and foreign separately....</span></p> <p><span>I have suggested that the domestic political consensus which has dominated the past two decades has been in essence an agreement on the \"welfare state.\"  Our conception of the welfare state has insisted, of course, that the government assure certain minimum standards of individual economic security.  In addition, we have come to broaden the consensus, after some false starts, to include the conviction that the government has a positive responsibility to adopt measures which will promote, insofar as possible, the full employment of the human and physical resources of the country.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, as a corollary to these two points, we have come to recognize that the federal government must largely provide the initiative in discharging these newly defined governmental responsibilities, and that this in turn implies a \"big\" federal government operating on a scale which was undreamed of twenty-five years ago....</span></p> <p><span>As this is written, we have had a three and one-half year period of Republican control of the executive branch of our government, and most of my illustrations therefore will be drawn from relatively current events.  I will not, however, neglect the period of Republican Congressional control, in 1946-1948, for there, too, we should find supporting evidence if my thesis is sound.</span></p> <p><span>Surely if the consensus which I have described did not actually exist, the newly elected Republicans in one of these two occasions would have put forward and executed programs and policies in fundamental conflict with those of their Democratic predecessors.</span></p> <p><span>Yet the two periods of Republican control have produced no such phenomenon.  To take this qeustion at its simplest level:  no New Deal legislation has thus far been replaced.  Indeed, in the 1952 campaign Republican candidates devoted a major share of their speeches trying to convince the voters that any such counterrevolution was the furthest thing from their minds....</span></p> <p><span>The same general conclusion results from a more particular examination of Republican actions in 1946-1947 and 1952-1956.  Measuring the actions of the present administration against the three broad propositions stated above, I think it is beyond dispute that the large body of its proposals, and certainly those which have been successful, lie well within the area of compromise staked out by the present consensus.</span></p> <p><span>Many Democrats may continue to suspect that acceptance of New Deal concepts by Republican leaders amount to no more than lip service.  They may assert that agencies such as the Labor Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are administered by Republican appointees who do not believe in them, are in unsafe hands, and they will certainly point to the favoring of special interests.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, in the broad view, Democrats can take pride in the extent to which the ideas have now been generally accepted.  Instead of an effort to reverse the direction of New Deal legislation in such fields as social security, minimum wages, and the like, the Republicans have agreed to modest extensions in several areas.  Social security coverage and benefits have been expanded.  The minimum wage rate has been increased.  Support for public housing as well as mortgage insurance has continued....</span></p> <p><span>The present administration's farm policies are under heavy attack.  I feel that the attack is justified.  Yet on objective consideration, not even here can it be said that the Republican party has challenged the premise of federal responsibility for maintaining farm income at reasonable levels....</span></p> <p><span>In this election year most of us will exercise our right to criticize or applaud the efforts of the administration in the domestic field.  Some may think that it has not gone far or fast enough; others may think it has gone too far.  But its stated policies and objectives clearly accept the first of the underlying premises of the New Deal:  that the federal government is responsible for certain minimum economic standards for all.</span></p> <p><span>The specific proposals advanced by the Eisenhower Republican administration offer us, however, an excellent case study of divergent views at work within the generally accepted consensus.  The Democrats, in the first two years as the minority in Congress, and in the second two years as the majority party, advanced counterproposals or criticisms of each administration bill.  These counterproposals ordinarily called for significantly higher levels of effort or assistance than the administration was willing to advocate.  The result was a bargaining situation.  But as is characteristic of most bargains, the give-and-take was on matters of degree, not principle.</span></p> <p><span>A typical example was the President's proposal for an increase in the minimum wage to $.90 an hour.  The Democrats put forward a figure of $1.10 an hour.  The political processes then became engaged both within and outside the Congress in the operations of bargaining and negotiation, and a compromise of $1.00 an hour was finally adopted.</span></p> <p><span>Though the Eisenhower administration presents an instructive case study in the operations of the consensus, we did not need to await the arrival of a Republican in the White House to confirm the fact that the postulates of the New Deal on economic security had become permanent features of our landscape.  It was clear, I think, as early as 1947, when the Republicans secured a majority in both houses of Congress for the first time since 1928.</span></p> <p><span>No piece of New Deal legislation, for instance, had been damned with more vehemence or ardor by the minority in the country and in Congress than the Wagner Act.  By the tenets of the Republican diehards, it was the work of the devil.  But far worse than devilish, some insisted it was \"unconstitutional\" and must be extirpated root and branch.</span></p> <p><span>Proposals which would have gone far towards this end were introduced, of course, in the Eightieth Congress, yet none of them succeeeded, in spite of Republican majorities in both houses.  The Taft-Hartley Act, which emerged as the compromise, cast formidable new obstacles in the way of union organization and conferred advantages upon management vis-a-vis labor which had not been therefore a part of the law.</span></p> <p><span>One may argue, as I have, that these features are ill-advised; that strictures in the act make it unduly difficult to organize unions, particularly in parts of the South; that some of the \"rights\" conferred on management do more harm than good if our objective is a healthy, peaceful relationship between these two great participants in our productive process; and that these weaknesses would seriously threaten our economic welfare in a period of depression.</span></p> <p><span>Yet it is significant that in the final analysis even those responsible for drafting this new law did not challenge the fundamental premise of the Wagner Act, namely, that labor should be protected in its right to organize, and that it should approach the bargaining table upon terms of substantial equality with management.</span></p> <p><span>The second of our three subheadings of the welfare state was the proposition that the federal government is responsible for affirmative measures for the promotion of full employment of our human and natural resources....</span></p> <p><span>On this second proposition, it may be that the quality and strength of our political agreement has not yet been convincingly tested.  We still hear talk in some Republican circles about the inflationary effect of full employment, and the corresponding advantages of four or five million unemployed to cushion upward pressures on the price level.</span></p> <p><span>Yet the administration did not hesitate to act in opposition to these voices during the economic recession of 1953-54.  The timing and tempo of its use of fiscal controls in general support of the economy may provide questions for legitimate political disagreement and debate.  But it cannot be charged with denying the need for government action.</span></p> <p><span>I find it personally inconceivable that a Republican administration would again permit an economic cataclysm even approaching the intensity of 1929....</span></p> <p><span>Of course, full employment is only part of the broad objective which calls<jtp>\n</jtp></span></p>"}

{"title": "The Arabs, Israel, and Ike | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>President Eisenhower's decision not to send arms to Israel, but to intervene decisively should aggression break out, was greeted in many quarters with sighs of relief.  There has been some doubt, however, as to the value of his pledge to intervene, through the United Nations instead of through the more flexible tripartite agreement of 1950.  Critics feel that a Russian veto could block United Nations intervention and that for the United States to act alone would be to assume a strongly imperialistic role in the eyes of the Middle East.</span></p> <p><span>That these dangers exist cannot be denied, but no other plan could circumvent them.  To act in concert with Great Britain and France would appear no less imperialistic than unilateral intervention.  In fact, intervention by the United States alone might well be more acceptable to the Middle East, which associates France with Algeria and Britain with the Suez.  If forced to act alone, Eisenhower assures the United States a greater freedom--both to act quickly and with less of a taint of colonialism.</span></p> <p><span>Equally important, the apparent decision to slip out of the 1950 Agreement, by eliminating one possibility of action, will make intervention through the United Nations slightly more probable.  Admittedly, United Nations intervention is not a surefire proposition.  Only a Russian walkout enabled the Security Council to take action in Korea.  Yet, in the Middle East, there is at least a fifty percent chance that Russia will agree to intervene through the United Nations.  Should the Israelis initiate the attack, the Soviets might possibly agree to let the U.N. intervene, since it would allow the Russians themselves to send troops to the Gaza.  Even though to let a Middle Eastern war run on unimpeded would be to permit their semi-allies, the Arabs, gradually to crush Israel, the chances are that the Russians would wish to intervene--without the Arab-Israeli balance of forces Russia would lose one of her strongest selling points in the area, Communist arms.</span></p> <p><span>Should the Arabs bring about a conflict, however, Russia would undoubtedly veto any Security Council action.  In this case, the U.S. could appeal to the General Assembly, and in the unlikely event of inaction inaction there, this country would have to act alone.  Since the United States must eventually take action, whether through the U.N. or alone, there is some feeling that Eisenhower should have put his case more strongly, in order to frighten both sides into submission.  Eisenhower's intentions, however, could not have been more clearly expressed--obviously he intends to intervene in one way or another should the need arise.  That the means which he proposes to use are not clearly stated is an advantage, not only as a piece of skillful maneuvering in an election year, but because it will give him greater freedom later \"to fit the punishment to the crime.\"  For this reason, the President's unclarified commitment--provided he does not fail to act in a pinch--is a masterstroke of diplomacy--while saying nothing definitely, his meaning is clear.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Congress and Civil Rights | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Amid cries of \"leap-year liberals\" from the left and \"usurpers\" from the right, the Eisenhower Administration last week presented a concrete civil rights program to Congress.  After three years of talking moderation, the Administration came up with moderate proposals, dealing primarily with the undisputed constitutional right to vote.</span></p> <p><span>Two of the President's requests are obviously necessary and relatively free from legal controversy.  A bipartisan commission to investigate denials of the right to vote and \"unwarranted\" economic pressure is valuable to put the whole problem in a clear perspective.  And an assistant attorney general in charge of civil rights is justified if for no other reason than the increased legal activity in that field.</span></p> <p><span>The crux of the proposed legislation, however, calls for a broad extension of Federal law to protect voters through civil proceedings.  Under existing statutes only harsh criminal procedure is open to the Attorney General.  Such action often involves emotionally charged trials which are difficult for both sides.  Because the primary aim of any civil rights law is to correct an abuse and not to punish an offender, civil proceedings should certainly be made available to the government.</span></p> <p><span>The Department of Justice also asked for authority to bring suit against anyone who seeks to prevent a person from exercising his right to vote.  At present, only state and local officials can be prosecuted, although attempts at intimidation and coercion often come from persons with no governmental connection.  In addition, the Justice Department wants permission for either it or a private individual to go directly to a Federal court in such cases without first exhausting lengthy state procedures.</span></p> <p><span>While all the legal proposals are designed simply to expedite enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment efficiently and speedily, they are under sharp attack from Southern lawmakers who are wary of any increase in Federal power.  On the other side, many Northern liberals feel that the proposals are not stringent enough.</span></p> <p><span>Although the Administration acted wisely in presenting a moderate program, that alone will not secure its passage.  Congress, particularly the Senate, has proved the perennial block to any civil rights legislation.</span></p> <p><span>If Eisenhower does not put the full weight of his prestige behind his recommendations, they will have small chance of survival.  The President has demonstrated on several occasions that he can put effective pressure on Congress when he so desires.  Unless his civil rights program receives the same attention that some of his budgets have, Eisenhower will have demonstrated that his program is nothing more than a token offering for the 1956 pilgrimage to the polls.</span></p>"}

Schlesinger did join the Signet and the <i>Advocate,</i> and Phi Beta Kappa elected him first marshal.</span></p> <p><span>One of the original group of Junior Fellows, he went on to serve as a civilian in Army intelligence during the war.  There, his liberal politics stirred up official antagonism.  As a civilian, he had commanded a number of Army officers, but when the Army finally drafted him, he was ranked as a private.  Disturbed by the sight of a private bossing officers, his superiors ordered him to wear civilian clothes.  Schlesinger apparently enjoys joking about the incident; his friends, however, feel the rank of private was grossly unjust and suggest that humor masks his real embarrassment.</span></p> <p><span>After the war, he published <i>The Age of Jackson,</i> challenging the standard analysis of Jackson as the arch frontiersman, and reinterpreting the period with more emphasis on its intellectual values and the urban roots of its reform spirit.  Though he is modest about the book's merits, it earned him a Pulitzer Prize for History at the age of twentyeight.

His mother is related to George Bancroft, a Jacksonian politician and outstanding historian of his day.  Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr. Francis Lee Higginson Professor, emeritus, is considered America's first great social historian.  Before his son returned to Harvard, the elder Schlesinger lectured on \"The Social and Intellectual History of the United States,\" but after his son joined the Faculty, the course was divided in half.  Arthur Schlesinger, Sr., taught the social history while his son lectured on the intellectual history.  Says his father, \"Arthur and I were always harmonious in our political thinking.\"</span></p> <p><span>Schlesinger's course in American intellectual history is now one of the most popular in the College.  At the first meeting this year, he stood before an overflow crowd of three hundred and announced with his dead-pan expression--\"Let's all petition for a bigger room.\"  Schlesinger delights his packed lecture hall with a unique combination of insights into intellectual trends, ironic descriptions of American religious prophets, and quips about conservatives from Fisher Ames to John Foster Dulles.</span></p> <p><span>Aside from traveling, much of his time is devoted to historical research and writing.  He is preparing the first volume of a series entitled <i>The Age of Rossevelt</i> for publication in the fall.  Though he is active politically, Schlesinger does not believe that the historian as such affects society appreciably.  \"The Primary motive of the historian is curiosity,\" he believes, \"and his greatest contribution to society is in satisfying that curiosity in others.  Anything else is merely a by-product.  The historian does not change society so much as he reflects it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Until the Republicans took office in 1952, Schlesinger, a registered Democrat, was active as a government aide.  Under Averell Harriman, Schlesinger served as a special counselor in the administration of the Marshall Plan.  But after the Republican victory, Schlesinger channeled his political energies into the Americans for Democratic Action, becoming national chairman for 1953-54.  In his book, <i>The Politics of Freedom,</i> his analysis of the A.D.A. partially defines his own philosophy.  The A.D.A. he says, is dedicated to \"...the tradition of liberalism--the tradition of Jackson and Hawthorne, the tradition of responsibility about politics and a moderate pessimism about man.\"</span></p> <p><span>As Schlesinger found an organ for his beliefs in the A.D.A., he found a political standard-bearer in his friend Adlai Stevenson.  In 1952 he joined Stevenson's \"brain trust\" and helped write speeches for the candidate.  If Stevenson is nominated again, Schlesinger may use his sabbatical next year to aid his campaign, as well as to finish his Roosevelt study.</span></p> <p><span>While Schlesinger's reputation as a political writer and a scholar has increased, the myth about his arrogance has also grown.  This myth originates not so much from any personal conceit, but from his intense identification with liberalism.  In informal discussions of current issues like segregation, he becomes caustic and impatient in defense of militant liberalism.  \"Why should the under-dog be patient while he gets kicked in the teeth?\"  he demands.  \"We don't need caution so much as sound reasoning and the courage to apply it.\"  This impatience with conservatism appears brash to critics who hear him debate.  Similarly, the moral tone of some of Schlesinger's magazine articles has reinforced the myth about his smugness.</span></p> <p><span>Schlesinger will vigorously argue political questions but his friends claim that he seldom discusses his career or his personal life.  One colleague, a professor of literature who finds in Schlesinger \"a deep humility at heart,\" probably uncovered the greatest source of the aura of arrogance around Schlesinger when he observed, \"Arthur is more informed in my field than I am.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "Eisenhower and the South | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>President Eisenhower at his recent press conference once again pleaded for moderation and responsible leadership on the integration issue in the South.  To the non-extreme Southerner, wedged uncomfortably between the racism of White Citizen's Councils and the militancy of the NAACP, the words were doubtless encouraging.  But with little support in the South itself, the moderate is finding it increasingly hard to subsist on the compliment-a-week strategy of the President.</span></p> <p><span>Numerous observers, including Adlai Stevenson and Governor Herter, have urged Eisenhower to take some decisive role in easing racial tensions in the South.  The most frequent proposal has advocated a bi-racial White House conference, to be composed of thoughtful and dispassionate Southern leaders.  Such a group would be valuable not only in repairing frayed communication lines between whites and Negroes, but also in preparing the ground for future study groups and advisory commissions organized on the state level.</span></p> <p><span>Eisenhower has so far sidestepped these proposals by pointing out that he asked Congress in his State of the Union message to authorize a joint commission to investigate illegal discrimination in the South.  The advantage of Congressional commission, according to the President, would be its power to subpoena witnesses and compel them to testify.</span></p> <p><span>Even if Congress should follow Eisenhower's request, which seems unlikely with 96 of its members pledged to fight integration on all fronts, a Congressional investigation is no answer to the crisis in the South.  The present problem is to enlist more Southerners in an effort toward gradual integration, and to reduce the tension which Southern politicians themselves have done much to foster.</span></p> <p><span>The President can best serve the cause of integration not by asking for a controversial investigation, but by lending the influence and prestige of his office to a high level meeting of moderate Southerners.

{"title": "The President and Dr. White | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The recent debate on whether or not President Eisen-hower should run for re-election following a heart attack would never have arisen in the years prior to 1931.  For, between 1912 when J.B. Herrick published the classical description of myocardial infarction and 1931, the condition was thought to be inevitably and rapidly fatal.</span></p> <p><span>In the latter year Dr. Paul Dudley White, already enjoying an international reputation as a cardiologist, reported on 200 coronary patients he had seen in his practice, emphasizing that many were still alive five to ten years following their first attack.  In 1941 Dr. White, in conjunction with Dr. E.F. Bland, completed his study of these patients.  Because treatment has hardly changed at all since then, these figures are still used in estimating the outlook after the first attack.</span></p> <p><span>Bland and White found that 19 percent of their 200 cases died within the first four weeks, 50 percent within ten years, and 31 percent were still alive after ten years.  Of those who did not survive a decade, 30 percent died in the first year, 17 percent the second, 17 percent the third, and ten percent the fourth, with a rapid falling off thereafter.</span></p> <p><span>Important factors for a prediction are hard to determine, but age is one of the most significant.  Bland and White found that the average age at the onset of the first attack of those who lived ten years was 51, of those who died within ten years, 57, and of those who died immediately, 61.</span></p> <p><span>Other factors are of course important.  The absence of marked persistent electrocariograph changes, irregularities in the heart's rhythm, and pain from temporary closing or spasn of the coronaries, are all reassuring.  They indicate that branches of the other coronary have established collateral cirulation to the area once served by the plugged vessel, and that the area of dead heard tissue is not large.</span></p> <p><span>The President apparently has none of these symptoms.  He is under constant medical observation.  He is receiving anti-coagulant treatment designed to prevent further trouble.  He is cutting down on social commitments and detail works.</span></p> <p><span>\"Unfortunately in a majority of cases recovery from the acute attack is followed by distressing symptoms, restricted activity, or invalidism,\" writes C.K. Fishberg of Columbia in his \"Disease of the Heart.\"  He notes that two thirds of White's surviving patients pursued fairly inactive lives with definite restrictions.  It is an old medical axiom that \"the most common complication of myocardial infarction is another myocardial infarction,\" and Fishberg estimates that such attacks \"recur in about 30 percent of the cases, usually within two years of the first attack.\"</span></p> <p><span>In \"Clinical Heart Disease\" Samuel A. Levene, Professor of Medicine, writes of coronary thrombosis that \"there is no other condition in the practice of medicine in which it is so difficult to prognosticate...  The physician should remain hopeful under the darkest circumstances and yet give a guarded prognosis when the progress seems most favorable.\"</span></p> <p><span>If the prognosis is guarded in a normal convalescence, there is no reason to change it in Mr. Eisenhower's case.  No matter how many social duites and petty details are shunted aside, there remains a heavy schedule of conferences, reading, and recommendations.  Even if the president is left only the largest and most important decisions to make, he will still be subject to the mental strain and worry that is frequently considered a contributing factor in coronary heart disease.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the risk involved, Dr. White has encouraged the president's second-term plans.  In doing this he may not only be voicing his opinion of the president's health, but lending hope for a normal future to cardiac patients all over the world. <b>M.J.

{"title": "Nixon | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Now that the effort to dump Nixon from the Republican ticket has run into strong, public opposition from President Eisenhower himself, the All-American Boy of the Republican Party is apparently destined for the number two spot once again--assuming that both Nixon and the convention nod approval.  If liberal Republicans remain silent between now and August, Nixon seems to have a clear path to the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Even the Democrats are pushing Nixon toward renomination.  Many at present are gleefully blasting him as a slanderer, but secretly hope that he will be Ike's running-mate.  \"Tricky Dicky,\" they say, is the Republican Party's Achilles Heel, and not many independents are going to vote for a heel, no matter who the President may be.  While the Republicans, therefore, want Nixon because they think he can win, the Democrats want Nixon because they think he might cause a Republican defeat.</span></p> <p><span>Both attitudes are discouraging, for both make Nixon the Republican Vice Presidential candidate, and in the likely event of a Republican victory, the Vice President, one heart-beat from the most important elective office in the free world.</span></p> <p><span>The thought of having as President \"that wonderful, attractive, honest and good Dick Nixon\"--as Helen Hayes put it--is, indeed, frightening.  From the start of his political career to his latest free-swinging superlatives about Chief Justice Warren, Nixon has proven that he is out for just one thing:  Richard Nixon.  Obviously, he now supports the Eisenhower legislative program, but it is virtually impossible to point to a single substantive policy in the past three year's that has been his own.  The combined lack of creative leadership and of consistent political principles make Nixon's opportunism dangerous to Eisenhower Republicanism and to the nation.</span></p> <p><span>Eisenhower can probably take substantial credit for effectively silencing McCarthy, and yet Nixon's first campaign was a miniature of McCarthy's tactics.  And in 1950, in his successful race for the Senate against Helen Gahagan Douglas, Nixon hid his own record by showing that his opponent had voted 353 times with Representative Vito Marcantonia, and was therefore \"soft on Communism.\"  Nixon failed to point out that on most of these votes Marcantonia was merely going along with the Democratic majority, and that on a key issue like Nixon's vote against economic aid to Korea five months before the attack, he had himself joined the isolationists and Marcantonio.  Nixon's smear campaigns of 1946 and 1950 hardly jibe with the President's own record in fighting McCarthyism.</span></p> <p><span>Nixon's role in the 1954 campaign is equally far from the President's opposition to smear and slander.  At one point, Eisenhower went so far as to say that he hoped the Communists-in-Government issue would not be an issue in the 1954 campaign.  Yet Nixon's whole speaking tour was a blatant effort to pin the Red Shirt on the Democrats and show that the Eisenhower Administration had \"kicked the Communists out of Government not by the hundreds, but by the thousands.\"  Nixon also revealed that when he came to power in 1953, he \"found in the files a blue print for socializing America.\"  He also found a document proving that the Communist Party had secretly decided to operate through the Democratic Party.  All of this does not quite amount to calling the Democrats traitors, but it comes so close to McCarthyism that it is surprising and dishearting to find Eisenhower supporting Nixon as his running-mate.</span></p> <p><span>Nor does Nixon's past voting record come near the kind of Eisenhower Republicanism he is now supporting.  Eisenhower strongly favors economic aid to under-developed nations, but Nixon not only opposed aid to Korea, (which was defeated by one vote in January, 1950) but he also was absent and unrecorded on Truman's Point Four Program.  Eisenhower strongly favors drastic revision of the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act, yet Nixon was one of the Senator's whose vote helped override Truman's veto.  Eisenhower strongly favors a liberal, long-term Reciprocal Trade Program, yet Nixon in 1948 voed against a three extension of the trade program.</span></p> <p><span>While this voting record may be only a prelude to the \"new\" Nixon, one who now supports the United Nations, economic aid, and a liberal trade program, his latest statement on segregation shows that his sense of political expedieney does not always lead him to principles which Eisenhower has supported.  After Nixon had dragged the Supreme Court into politics by praising a \"great, Republican Chief Justice\" for the segregation decision, Eisenhower himself had to repudiate the Vice-President and show that this issue, above all others, must be kept as far from politics as possible.  Clearly, Nixon lacks the qualities of statesmanship which are perhaps Eisenhower's greatest strength.</span></p> <p><span>Eisenhower's statesmanship has been the kind that can unify a nation, Nixon's antics are intensely partisan.  Eisenhower's policy has been generally liberal; Nixon's real policy is totally elusive.  As a quick-change artist of the worst sort, Nixon's entire political career makes current support for Eisenhower's Republicanism highly questionable.  There are many independents and even Democrats who would support Eisenhower--but not if Nixon is on the ticket.  If the President is really attempting to bring the Republican Party up to date, he had better make sure that his possible successor has principles in which both Eisenhower and the nation can have confidence.</span></p>"}

Although some of the reductions were no doubt worthwhile savings, others threaten to impair U.S. military effectiveness.</span></p> <p><span>Every year since 1954 U.S. production of piloted aircraft has declined steadily.  This year only 8,000 planes are expected to be produced in the United States, a decline of almost 2,000 from two years ago.  And for the 1957 defense budget, the Administration has asked Congress for funds which will buy at most 4,000 planes.  By comparison, the Soviet Union annually produces 10-16,000 planes.</span></p> <p><span>Not only is the U.S. falling behind the Soviet Union, but this country is also failing to achieve its own stated air power goals.  Around 6,200 new planes are necessary each year to bring U.S. striking power up to minimum strength.  Yet the figures for 1957 indicate that the services will barely be able to replace losses from operational failures, attrition, and obsolescence.</span></p> <p><span>While the Administration may stress production of medium range and intercontinental missiles, it would be dangerous indeed if production of piloted aircraft should be cut.  Pilots may someday be as obsolete as cavalrymen, but that day is far in the future.  Even Soviet figures show a continued emphasis on fighters and long-range bombers while proceeding with research on missile warfare.</span></p> <p><span>Even in the field of missiles, many observers, notably Senator Jackson of Washington, fear that the United States may be losing in that critical race.  Certainly no one would quarrel with the Administration's request for more money for missiles, or with Secretary of Defense Wilson's forthcoming appointment of a \"missile czar.\"  But missiles should not overshadow the need for conventional aircraft; only certain evidence that Communist military strength is waning should have that effect.  No one so far has produced such evidence--on the contrary, the Soviet display of air power over Moscow last spring indicates that their strength is greater than ever.</span></p> <p><span>In the light of the few facts available and the many apprehensions, Congressional investigations of the Department of Defense and the Armed Forces should certainly proceed quickly.  Within the bounds of security, the American people should know the facts of U.S. military strength and weakness.

{"title": "Looking Over Jordan | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>With Communist arms pouring into the Middle East and Israel clamoring for aid to balance them, a critical situation has become precipitous.  The United States must obviously take a strong stand in order to live up to her responsibilities as a world leader.  There is some question, however, as to what this responsibility is.  Recently, Israel's Ambassador Abba Eban stated that it was the \"moral duty\" of this country to send arms to Israel.  Admitting that, as a member of the United Nations, we do have a duty to protect Israel from invasion, the arms solution is perhaps the worst that could be conceived.</span></p> <p><span>Before taking any action the United States must define clearly what its moral responsibility is.  Certainly, as a nation with democratic institutions Israel has strong claim to American sympathies.  But this natural affinity must not lead the United States into grossly misstating its position.  Both Israel and the Arab nations are members of the United Nations, and as such are entitled to equal protection.  It would be foolish for this country to alienate the important Arab bloc under the illusion that we are committed to protection of Israel alone.</span></p> <p><span>When the accounts are balanced, neither side comes out spotless.  Each side has raided the other almost continuously since the partition in 1948; and while the Israelis have taken the initiative most often in recent months, the Arabs on their side have sworn a holy alliance to annihilate Israel.  Each side has its justifications, the Arabs their million refugees, the Israelis a dream of centuries.  In view of this, the United States can espouse neither cause at the expense of the other.</span></p> <p><span>Sending arms to Israel is as ineffective a solution as it is foolishly partial.  Given the Arab fervor--and the Communist willingness to exploit it with military aid--U.S. arms could only ignite an explosive arms race.  Nor are such arms necessary for the preservation of the Israeli state.  If Israel were ever subjected to a full-scale Arab attack, the same arms would be used by U.S. and U.N. forces in immediate action against the aggressor.  By clearly stating that the present boundaries will be maintained, the U.S. will both forestall an arms race and protect Israel as a state.</span></p> <p><span>To preserve its detachment, the United States must act through the United Nations, as President Eisenhower and Prime Minister Eden have indicated.  Their recent statement, however, which was limited to stressing mediation, is not strong enough.  Working through the United Nations must not mean merely maintaining observation posts.  The United Nations should send troops to create a neutral zone, thereby preventing the retaliatory raids which each day furnish an excuse for all-out war.</span></p> <p><span>United Nations intervention, however, must take a discreet form.  For one thing, the troops should come largely from nations which would not appear to the Arabs as representative of Western colonialism.  Members from <b>the Asian bloc, such as the</b> Philippines, would be convincing.  The border guard need not be a large force, for its purpose would be to stop the small day-to-day aggressions.</span></p> <p><span>The United Nations border guard plan has certain definite advantages:  while protecting both sides from their own rabid attitudes, it commits none of the member nations to either side.  But it is not enough, for even though the force would obviously represent world opinion, Arab resentment would still run strong.  The Arabs might be placated, however, if the U.N. or the United States aided in relocating the Arab refugees, whose presence is one of the roots of Arab hostility.</span></p> <p><span>Many look askance at the possibility of effective United Nations action.  Perhaps the idea of the U.N. ever assuming an active responsibility is now an idle dream.  There is, however, almost no other means of asserting our desire for peace convincingly or effectively.  And even though a border guard could not arrange a lasting peace, it would at least halt the development of hostilities--calming the atmosphere and making rational consideration on both sides more possible.</span></p> <p><span><b>CRIMSON editorial policy, as expressed in the above unsigned article, is determined by a majority vote of the Editors at weekly meetings.

{"title": "The President's Decision | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Not since Scarlett did her deeds at Tara had a Southern plantation received such national notoriety.  The President's golf score at Thomasville was low, his aim good, and his smile broad--indications enough for the pollsters and politicians that Eisenhower would run again.  In all the will-he-or-won't-he discussions, however, there is one critical problem which seems to have gone with the wind:  the effect of the President's decision on U.S. foreign affairs.</span></p> <p><span>It is surprising that foreign affairs has taken a secondary role in analyses of the President's decision to run or not to run.  For if the President's 1952 decision is any guide, his answer this week may well rest almost entirely on his own personal desire to mould this country's foreign policy.  Paul Hoffmann, for instance, has reported that when he went to Europe in 1952 to persuade Eisenhower to contest the Republican nomination, the only argument that held any weight with the General was the notion that he, and he alone, could make great, beneficial contributions to the cause of world peace.  This sense of personal mission--based on Eisenhower's war-time contacts with European and Soviet leaders, as well as his popularity with large segments of the American people--may well have pushed him down the road to the Presidency with greater force than less messianic crusades.</span></p> <p><span>Motives aside, Eisenhower as President has shown that when he does take personal control over foreign affairs, his creative leadership is apparent.  The Atoms-for-Peace plan, the Geneva Conference, and the scheme for mutual aerial inspection have all shown that the President when he chooses, is his own best Secretary of State.  Indeed, at one critical point, Eisenhower had to side-step both the Vice President and Foster Dulles to prevent U.S. troops from fighting a hopeless defense of Indo-china.</span></p> <p><span>Eisenhower's creative leadership, though it sometimes had a hard time asserting itself through the ranks of \"The Team,\" has disappeared almost totally after the President's heart attack.  Since September, the Soviets have smiled their way through Asia and have courted, in a dangerously successful manner, neutrals from Yugoslavia to Cambodia.  Imaginative responses from Washington to new Soviet techniques have been nil.  In fact, the Middle Eastern muddle is just the latest and best instance of a policy that evidently evolved while the policy-makers were losing drinks at shuffleboard in the Bahamas.  Even Senator George, that most agreeable Democrat, has now stated flatly that the President's leadership is simply not what it used to be.  At a time when the President should be spending more time than ever studying day-to-day developments in foreign affairs, Eisenhower is, necessarily, taking on lighter load of work.  A year of faltering foreign policy is regrettable; five years of it would be disastrous.</span></p> <p><span>The President undoubtedly realizes that his heart attack has diluted his own power in foreign affairs.  If he decides to run again in order to continue his commendable personal mission, he should be prepared to devote his full energies to the task of leading this country's foreign policy.  If his health precludes his active leadership, we hope he has the wisdom to leave his mission to another.</span></p>"}
{"title": "What I Think | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It's good to see that Adlai Stevenson, despite exhortations from some of his supporters to pitch his campaign this time on a less \"intellectual\" and more \"popular\" level, is not only appearing once more as the author of a book, but that he has even dared to include the word \"think\" in the title.  To many this will seem like political hari-kari, or cutting off one's own egghead.  If Mr. Stevenson should become President this year, however, his literary activity could bring a new dimension into politics.  One can envision future campaigns in which best-seller lists carry more weight than Gallup polls, and during which the Senate might be appalled to discover that political interests have been distributing $2,000 \"gifts\" to various book reviewers.</span></p> <p><span>Mr. Stevenson's current work, however, is not long on literary orginality.  <i>What I Think</i> is a selection of the Democratic leader's speeches and writings since 1952, and as such contains nothing that some listeners or readers in the country have not already encountered.  Even the introduction, in which the author describes the role he has tried to play as \"titular head\" of an opposition party, and which is the only \"new\" piece in the book, turns out to be a rather faithful rehash of Mr. Stevenson's article in this February's issue of <i>Harper's Magazine.</i></span></p> <p><span>Yet <i>What I Think</i> easily makes up in variety what it lacks in absolute originality.  Indeed, if the book does nothing else, it demonstrates Mr. Stevenson's remarkable ability to speak wisely, urbanely, and appropriately on a wide variety of topics in a wide variety of tones.  To audiences ranging from the readers of <i>Fortune</i> to the Democratic National Committee to the senior class of Smith College, and on subjects as varied as the farm problem, the Republicans' \"twenty years of treason\" charge, United States relations with Canada, and \"This I Believe,\" Mr. Stevenson is uniformly eloquent.  This wide diversity of subject and approach contributes substantially to the book's readability.</span></p> <p><span>So too does the renowned Stevenson with, which asserts itself primarily in the straight political speeches with quips like:  \"The Republicans have been in office for twenty months--or long enough to elect Maine's first Democratic governor in twenty years.\"  There is also Mr. Stevenson's less famous but equally impressive facility with the serious metaphor, which allows him to describe the sub-standard, depressed areas of the American economy as \"stagnant pools into which the tide of prosperity has failed to flow.\"</span></p> <p><span>In general, the intellectual content of Mr. Stevenson's writings might be characterized as halfway between a brilliant social science lecture and a routine political speech:  while rarely attaining the insights of the former, the author constantly displays a greater understanding and soundness of thought than is usually found in the latter.  Four years after his appearance on the national political scene, Mr. Stevenson's intellect still marks him as an extraordinary politician.</span></p> <p><span>The Democratic candidate's political views themselves are best described as moderately liberal.  He says little that any member of the Democratic Party would oppose, and even when he attacks the Eisenhower Administration, it is a question not of what the nation's policy should be, but of whether or not the President has adhered to the course which is supported by Democrats and Republicans alike.  Typically, the Stevenson solution for the farm problem is merely to try harder than the Republicans have tried, using any available means--including 90 percent price supports if necessary--to boost the farmer's income.  The G.O.P. \"made off with the Democratic farm plank\" in 1952, Mr. Stevenson contends, but \"returned it immediately after the election.\"  On other main issues of his current campaign, such as the Administration's \"giveaway\" of public resources, its favoritism toward big business, and its \"rattling of the saber\" in world affairs, the author similarly charges that the G.O.P. has renounced the Democrat-inspired policies on which it rode into office.</span></p> <p><span>The disappointing thing about Mr. Stevenson's views lies not so much in what he says as in what he leaves unsaid.  Almost all his opinions seem designed to fit neatly within the currently-accepted range of alternatives and to avoid any issues that might be too unorthodox politically.  Thus he says virtually nothing about the segregation problem, and gives no definite idea of whether he, as President, would recognize Communist China or support its membership in the United Nations.  Similarly, his views on \"Medicine and Public Policy\" stress the great need for improved service but fail even to consider the advantages or disadvantages that socialized medicine might have for the United States.</span></p> <p><span>Yet while Mr. Stevenson hedges on these important political issues, he is refreshingly aware and outspoken about such intellectual concerns as the threat of thought conformity--the victory of \"the army of mass mediocrity, with banners flying,\" led by \"the neo-heathens.\"  <i>What I Think</i> is thus a very unusual book.  Published by a Presidential candidate in the middle of his campaign, it reveals a unique combination of political realism with an unsurrendered intellectual idealism.  Yet although the book reviewers may speak now, the real judgement must await next November.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Powell Amendment | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When President Eisenhower's $1.6 million school construction bill dropped into Congressional hoppers last month, it seemed destined for quick enactment.  The measure had been drawn up after consultation with some of the nation's leading educators.  Even detractors of the administration's program admitted that the school building proposal was good in principle; federal funds for school construction were urgently needed.  Their only reservation was that the bill simply did not grant enough money.  Today, however, the measure lies moribund in the House Rules Committee, slowly being strangled by the Powell Amendment.</span></p> <p><span>The brainstorm of New York Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, this amendment would withhold federal funds from any school district that refused to obey the Supreme Court decision prohibiting segregation in public schools.  Powell argues that no federal money should be spent on segregated school programs because such construction would invite Southern districts to circumvent the law.  If federal funds are used to build segregated schools now, Powell suggests, these structures will be illogically situated when desegregation arrives.</span></p> <p><span>Naturally enough, the Powell Amendment has come in for a great deal of Southern criticism.  Should the bill, with the amendment attached, ride through the House on Northern votes, it is certain to fail in the Upper House where Dixie Senators would block its passage.  If Powell does not agree to withdraw his amendment, therefore, he will probably kill all chance of federal aid to school construction--at least during this session of Congress.</span></p> <p><span>The school bill's death would be regrettable; for, as the recent White House Conference on Education has reported, the need for federal aid in new school construction is critical.  The amendment's provisions, moreover, would affect those sections of the country which need such aid the most:  the deep South, where many school districts face the prospect of making do with plants that are little short of decrepit.</span></p> <p><span>These are the same school districts that have been dilatory about complying with the desegregation decision.  Powell maintains, and with some justice, that, if Southern districts refuse to desegregate, Congress should make continued segregation costly for them.  His proposal, however, would, in effect, block federal aid from all school districts, not just those which have defied the Court.</span></p> <p><span>In attempting indirectly to enforce the Court's decision, Congress would be trying to fulfill a function for which it is eminently unsuited.  A history of painful episodes indicates that Congress is not the arena in which to settle matters of race relations.  The Powell Amendment is an attempt to make the Congress the arbiter of inter-racial antagonisms in the South--a role it cannot play.</span></p> <p><span>While the congressional battle over the Powell Amendment winds on, the need for a federally-supported school construction program grows more urgent.  The bill to grant such aid is dangerously near extinction.  The immediate need for government aid to education should overbalance the desire for Congressional enforcement of the desegregation decision.  Congressman Powell should withdraw his rider and allow the school bill to rise from its death bed.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Long-Term Assistance | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When President Eisenhower submits his foreign aid message to Congress within the next two weeks, he will have the chance to demonstrate once and for all that the United States is in the economic assistance business to stay.  In the face of the annual Congressional demands to end the \"give-away program,\" Mr. Dulles has already announced Administration plans to set aside a special fund of $100 million for long-term aid projects.  Although the fund is minute as federal budgets go, it is a clear and welcome recognition that foreign economic aid must be an important continuing part of U.S. policy.</span></p> <p><span>A strong argument for setting up even a limited long term fund is that an effective aid program demands advance planning based on financial guarantees that do not disappear with each fiscal year.  Simply stated, few projects that are worth the money can be completed in the short space of twelve months, and those that can be finished are generally valuable as part of a broader, continuing program.  Business and military enterprises have accepted this principle for years, and it is surprising that long-range financial planning has been absent this long from U.S. programs of economic aid.</span></p> <p><span>The proposal for a fund for long-term aid is also important as the first concrete U.S. reaction to the promises made by the Soviet leaders in Africa and Asia.  From Burma, India, and Afghanistan in the East, to Egypt and Liberia in the West, the Soviets have tried to sell the notion that they can best provide the capital and technicians and equipment needed by less developed nations.  It is pointless to proclaim that Asians must beware Soviets bearing gifts, for the gifts look pretty delectable to free, but underveloped countries.  The only answer is for the United States to pick up the challenge and demonstrate that dollars and sincerity can at least equal Soviet promises.  Since this will be a long contest, Mr. Dulles' acceptance of the principle of long-term aid is especially reassuring.</span></p> <p><span>It is a sad commentary on American politics, however, that appeals for long-term aid must be based upon Soviet actions.  The need for U.S. aid would be just as compelling without any threat from the Soviet Union, and if under-developed nations get the idea that the U.S. is merely combatting Communism with dollars, they will take the dollars but reject the friendship that could accompany them.</span></p> <p><span>It would be an even more dangerous error for Congress to suggest that nations receiving U.S. aid will eventually accept a foreign policy dictated from Washington.  Already, arguments to this effect have boomerang:  some Congressmen now cite unchanged neutralist foreign policies as proof that U.S. aid is valueless to this country.  Mr. Dulles put the counter argument well:  \"Our interest will be fully served if other nations maintain their independence and strengthen their free institutions.  We have no further aims than these.\"</span></p> <p><span>Paradoxically, of course, the U.S. will win more friends by attempting to influence fewer people.  And the same nations that are adamantly independent are themselves a strong deterrent to Communist expansion.  By passing even a limited program of long-term aid, Washington can assure these under-developed nations that annual Congressional budgetary sniping will not kill the principle of long-term economic assistance.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Rice Roots Challenge | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>A cautious increase in U.S. aid to technical assistance through regional groups and the United Nations, even when combined with a small fund for direct but long-term U.S. aid, will not approach a solution to the immense problems facing the under-developed two-thirds of the world.  If this country adopts both methods, it can demonstrate that U.S. aid will continue over the long haul, and that increasing amounts of assistance will be channeled through more acceptable international agencies.  But the U.S. program would be still cautions, still small, still limited--a long way from the imaginative plans that this country must consider.</span></p> <p><span>One such plan that deserves U.S. support is a proposed Special United Nations Fund for Economic Development--appropriately labelled SUNFED.  With an initial capital of $250 million, contributed by governments and private sources, this fund would provide grants and liberal long-term loans to nations planning basic development projects like roads, dams, hospitals, and schools.  In many countries, some of these projects are underway now with substantial outside aid, but there is an increasing desire on the part of have-not nations to repay loans or grants in the future.  SUNFED has remained unfed because of the refusal of some Western nations, particularly the U.S., to contribute to the fund before a workable disarmament plan makes smaller defense budgets practicable.  Disarmament appears so distant, however, that the United Nations should delay the establishment of SUNFED no longer.  The funds this country should contribute to the total $250 million program would barely dent a budget which includes a $44 billion defense program and such a gesture from Washington at this time would inspire an imaginative and needed program.</span></p> <p><span>Valuable as SUNFED should become, however, it would form only a small drop in the reservoir demanded by a large scale program of world development.  Conservative estimates put the capital now needed by under-developed nations at $14 billion per year.  As basic projects lead to new demands for more material improvement in the next few years, the financial need is certain to skyrocket.  A little more land and a little more rice will not satisfy peasants who have suddenly begun to sense that they can change their conditions.</span></p> <p><span>This is the challenge from the rice roots.  It exists apart from the challenge of Communism and would demand Western action even if the Soviet Union were not selling a new brand of expansionism.  But since the Soviet Union has already entered Asia and Africa with rubles, technicians, and machines, the U.S. is faced with an even more urgent task.  For the twin purposes of containing Communism and helping under-developed nations to lift their standards of living have coalesced from Japan to Mexico.  President Eisenhower's \"Atoms-for-Peace\" plan is one daring response to the challenge; President Truman's \"Point Four\" program was another.  Long-term aid, increased allocations to the U.N., and the establishment of SUNFED will also help.  But if the United States claims to be something more than the wealthiest suburb of the world, it will have to put to use its full imagination and generosity.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Academic Links for the Defense Department | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Just about a year ago Najaab B. Halaby boarded a plane in New York.  Halaby, Ford Foundation consultant, took with him two magazines to read during the flight to Boston--<i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek.</i>  Appointed by Foundation trustees to evaluate a novel Defense Studies Program here for possible financial aid, he was surprised to notice articles in both magazines describing the program.</span></p> <p><span>The consultant was equally impressed with the program itself and its founder, W. Barton Leach '21, Story Professor of Law.  He reported favorably to the trustees.  Three months later Leach received $214,800--enough to place the program on solid ground after a shaky first year.</span></p> <p><span>Since then the idea of providing training to serve as a background for Defense Department employees has spread to other universities--exactly as Leach originally intended.  At Dartmouth, John A. Masland and Lawrence W. Radwar, experts in military history, are interested and plan to launch a seminar in the near future.  Roger Hilsman at the Center of International Studies at Princeton envisions a seminar \"soon.\"  Ohio State University, which has considerable funds available for this type of work is also interested in establishing a program.  Other groups at Yale, the University of Wisconsin, and the University of Virginia are also considering the establishment of defense seminars.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>One Course So Far</i></b></span></p> <p><span>The Defense Studies Program at present offers but one course--the Defense Policy Seminar, open only to graduate students.  Leach plans eventually, however, to promote a plan for undergraduate courses as well.</span></p> <p><span>His immediate goal is to obtain people directly from the Defense Department to study military history, economics, and policy courses.  He had one student last year and one this year from the Department, but neither was here primarily for that purpose.</span></p> <p><span>Now that the program is on solid ground, Leach has started to look toward publishing a journal in the field--an \"American Journal of National Defense,\" as he calls it.  The publication would fill the gaps left by service journals today.  It would be directed to a foreign affairs audience, and would provide a means for presenting policies as they develop with both sides of each issue printed at the same time, side by side.</span></p> <p><span>Leach had been connected in one way or another with the Defense Department and the Air Force, in addition to holding his Law School post, for a number of years.  He wrote to President Pusey in the fall of 1953 to explain an idea which he had thought about for several years.  In the letter he explained that every department of the government had some form of unofficial academic tie, with people working in the field and conducting research pertaining to the work of a particular area of the department.  Only the Defense Department lacked a breeding ground for future employees.</span></p> <p><span>\"Since college should be a place where a student can read, grow, and expand,\" Leach continued, \"and is the beginning and not the end of education,\" a program in defense work could provide a trained group of people who could go into the Defense Department as a career.</span></p> <p><span>The dearth of training facilities for defense personnel was understandable until the end of World War II, Leach went on, before Great Britain \"began to lose its place in the sun and the United States and Russia began to emerge as the major postwar powers.\"  The post-war change became apparent when 60 to 70 percent of the annual budget--equivalent to 15 per cent of the gross national product--was allocated to defense work.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>The Bag of Resources</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Leach concluded the letter with a challenge to the President.  As the need for a defense training course became more apparent, he related, the universities had an obligation to readjust quickly to meet the need.  \"And no place in the country has a better bag of resources\" for doing the job.</span></p> <p><span>Pusey's answer, through Dean Bundy, was nothing but a polite brush-off.  They agreed that the idea was \"a very good and very interesting one.\"  But the job got no further, and Leach was forced to launch the program without financial aid.  Both the Law School and the Graduate School of Public Administration listed a seminar on defense in their 1954-55 catalogues, and Littauer subsequently formally assumed sponsorship of the program.</span></p> <p><span>When Leach started his second year with the seminar this fall, he had come a long way.  Instead of only 60 books from his personal library, he had 1,550 pages of reading prepared by last year's students.  \"Some of it is good, and some very bad,\" Leach comments.  Army Col. Grank A. Osmanski, a Business School student, formed a student group which handled administrative details and preparation of literature for the program last year.  \"Osmanski literally saved the entire project,\" Leach entusiastically states.  Now Leach's staff, available since the Ford grant, prepares and distributes reading for each week's session, freeing the students for more productive work in the course.</span></p> <p><span>One example of reading prepared for students is the issue created by Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway's farewell letter, written after he had been denied reappointment to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Ridgway had sevely criticized the proposed 300,000 man cut in the Army personnel and had been attacked in return.  When he left his post, he defended his position and the original size of the Army.  Readings on both sides of the question are provided, with appropriate comment.  These, as all the readings, are available to anyone who has use for them.  Bundy and H. Bradford Westerfield, instructor in Government, use some of the seminar's material in their American foreign policy course--Government 185.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>30 Students Registered</i></b></span></p> <p><span>After the course had been listed in the 1954-'55 Law School and Littauer catalogues, applications for admission justified Leach's enthusiasm for the program.  More than 30 students registered for the seminar, including Col. Trevor N. Dupuy, professor of Military Science and Tactics at the Army ROTC unit, and his adjutant, Capt. Roy G. Simkins, Jr. Nine officers studying at the Business School also enrolled.</span></p> <p><span>A more serious difficulty began to plague Leach.  He and his instructors had virtually no materials with which to start, since the program was definitive.  The only books Leach could use were those in his personal library.  To meet this problem he began in the spring and summer of 1954 to piece together press clippings relative to various fields of defense work.</span></p> <p><span>To show the possibilities of such a collection, Leach categorized all those dealing with Eisenhower's \"New Look,\" announced in late 1953 and used as the basis of the fiscal 1955 defense budget.  He took the collection to the Air University at Maxwell Field, Alabama, because he thought it might be of interest to students in the War College there.</span></p> <p><span>The clippings, organized to show how one year's policy in a certain area is formed, included reports of Congressional hearings, budget figures, and commentary to connect the material.  Leach asked Air Force officials to publish a book using this material, since both he and the War College could use it for instructional purposes.  The Air Force obliged and reproduced the collection in a 600-page volume.  Leach received 12 of the books, partially solving his problem.  Students filled the remaining gap by selecting and mimeographing readings for each week.</span></p> <p><span>Leach also needed lecturers to put students in closer touch with the situation.  He approached friends in the Air Force and asked them to supply good lecturers for the course.  They replied in a cautious letter, promising \"everything they could do without harming the Air Force.\"  But in the end, Leach neither asked for nor received a single Air Force lecturer.  Supposing that half the others he asked would decline, he asked twice as many people as he needed.  Not one turned down the invitation, and Leach was faced with twice as many lecturers as he needed.</span></p> <p><span>But Leach also had to teach his two regular courses on property at the Law School, in addition to all the problems he had in straightening out his new program.  The strain became so great that in February, 1955, he had to \"just go away for three weeks.\"  By then the program was firmly established.</span></p> <p><span><b><i>'Carry the Torch'</i></b></span></p> <p><span>The plan had acquired enough momentum, largely due to the cooperation of Arthur Smithies, professor of Economics, and Osmanski's planning, that others began to see its potentialities.  After Leach returned from his vacation, he saw clearly that if the program was going to continue, it would need both financial support and a full-time administrative staff.  He also needed personnel who could \"carry the torch to other schools and light the fire of defense study.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Defense Department was not unaware of the project.  Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert B. Anderson had heard of the program and invited Leach to Washington to discuss with Carter L. Burgess, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Personnel, the potential of the program as a training course for career defense personnel.  Burgess at that time expressed a desire for employing people who had taken Leach's course.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile two of his students had taken a Junior Management Assistant's</span></p> <p><span><b><i>Cavers Suggests Ford</i></b></span></p> <p><span>Leach tried with little success to obtain funds for the project during the summer of 1954.  David F. Cavers, associate Dean of the Law School, suggested that Leach try the Ford Foundation.</span></p> <p><span>But the 11-month wait for an answer from the Foundation made it clear that if the program was going to hire more people, Leach couldn't wait for the grant to come through.  Bundy took the risk for hiring Edward L. Katzenbach from Columbia.  But Katzenbach wasn't enough.  Leach needed both senior men in areas relative to defense study and young men to conduch research.  He gambled and hired the men he felt necessary, guaranteeing the University that if the grand did not materialize he would pay the salaries of the new staff from his own pocket.</span></p> <p><span>Since neither the Law School nor Littauer had room for his new project, Leach had to find office space.  He soon moved into most of the first floor of the Geographical Institute at 2 Divinity Ave., where he and his staff are now comfortably established in furnishings valued at nearly $7,000 by some of his less fortunate colleagues.</span></p> <p><span>Leach envisions inevitable expansion for his project, but he must first find permanent financial backing for the program.  Grants from foundations are usually offered for short terms, with the expectation that the projects will be able to find other backers once established.  But after Leach recruits some \"angels,\" he plans to develop the program into a field with continuity.  He eventually wants related courses of study offered in the College, starting with the junior year.  These courses would lead to a series of seminars and graduate courses.</span></p> <p><span>Leach knows he will never be able to place his students directly in the Defense Department and that the Department will probably never establish an official connection with the program.  But this does not discourage him.  He wants not an evolution toward emphasis on defense programs throughout the country, but an immediate breakthrough.</span></p> <p><span>\"With the increasing defense demands of this nation,\" Leach emphatically states, \"comes an immediate obligation for the universities to assume responsibility and provide academic links which are so necessary to successful defense planning.  The imperative nature of defense demands makes an immediate course of action a necessity.\"</span></p> <p><span>And the increasing importance of the Cold War, as well as the interest developing in universities throughout the country, is beginning to prove Leach was correct in anticipating the magnitude and importance of his pilot project.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The President's Speech | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The good feelings between Congress and the President that had cooled Washington's political heat last January were notably missing after this year's State of the Union message.  Criticism from Democratic leaders was more outspoken, and Republicans lyrically referred to the speech as \"superb, superlative, and sublime.\"  Even the President failed to repeat last year's plea for \"harmony and good will\" as he attempted to set a liberal Republican platform that could bring victory in November with or without his name on the ballot.</span></p> <p><span>Peace, prosperity, and progressive social legislation seem to constitute Eisenhower's formula for success.  Although many of his foreign and domestic proposals are commendable, at least in theory, it is regrettable that he had to paint such a rosy background for his program.  Conditions--both at home and abroad--are just not that good.</span></p> <p><span>Slums, juvenile delinquincy, falling farm income, crowded mental hospitals, under-staffed and over-crowed schools are all dramatic indications that the state of the Union may not be as healthy as the President says.  And it is hard to deny that the U.S. is facing a crisis in foreign affairs as the Soviets begin to smile their way into Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.  Even in the field of national defense, which should be the President's <i>forte,</i> recent criticisms have shown that not only may the U.S. have dangerously weakened its ground forces, but also that it may have fallen behind the Soviets in nuclear weapons.</span></p> <p><span>Despite Eisenhower's optimistic picture of American and world conditions, which seem to be based more on electoral hopes than facts, there are many proposals in the message which deserve support from the Democratic Congress.  His foreign aid and trade programs, particularly, should receive high priority, although the offer of long-term economic aid would have sounded more impressive abroad if the President had recommended assistance for its own sake and not as an anti-communist weapon.</span></p> <p><span>In certain domestic fields, too, the President's program should receive support from Democratic strategists.  Expansion of social security and other social welfare proposals certainly sound good within the President's general terms, and flood insurance is something that both parties should uphold.  The President seems to have come around to the Democratic position on a pay-as-you-ride highway construction program, so there should be enough support for this important measure.  A review of the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act is another suggestion that ought to be adopted.</span></p> <p><span>Although these proposals ought to satisfy both liberal Democrats and liberal Republicans, there are other areas in which liberals should not say \"Me Too,\" but should go beyond the President's recommendations.  In his housing proposal, the President has asked for a meagre 35,000 federal units for each of the next two years, while the 1950 census classified 15,000,000 homes \"substandard.\"  In school construction, too, the President's recognition of the need for increased federal aid is encouraging, but the amount he reportedly will request falls short of the minimum necessary to attack one of the nation's most serious problems.</span></p> <p><span>Actually, there was very little new or startling in the President's message.  His farm and tax policies have already created some noise, but the message was generally quiet and self-satisfied.  His proposals seemed to recognize most of the important problems--even if his solutions were not always adequate.  The President's optimistic view of the state of the nation, and the state of the world, is justifiable only it he meets these problems with the full force of government.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Eisenhower on Education | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>President Eisenhower's emergency message to Congress on federal aid to school construction is not only more generous than his program of eleven months ago, but far more realistic.  The financial recommendations are no longer completely inadequate, and the conditions which make a locality eligible for aid no longer approach federal control.  The only string which the President ties to the federal grants of $250,000,000 a year for five years is need.  Although the bill, which also promises federal purchase of $750,000,000 of school construction bonds, failed to meet either educators' hopes or Democratic proposals, it was definitely a step in the right direction.</span></p> <p><span>The plan, however, has several weak aspects.  The most obvious drawback is the size of the allocation, hardly enough to fulfill Eisenhower's wishful thought that the bill will meet \"current and future needs.\"  Whether the Administration's program or Democratic Congressman Kelly's proposal for $400,000,000 a year in direct grants is the more realistic is obscured by politics and lack of statistics.  Few, however, will deny that schools could use the extra money of the Democrat's proposal.  Another criticism is leveled at the President's message by several liberal legislators who would attach a rider to the bill banning aid to segregated schools.  Such a rider would not only be misplaced, but would mean death by filibuster for the program.</span></p> <p><span>More important and more basic than the questions of amount and segregation, is the dire shortage of teachers.  Though intimately connected with school construction, it is badly neglected in the President's proposals.  His only offering is \"my earnest hope that ... the states and communities will give increasing attention to this taproot of all education ...\" It is good to be earnest, but far more important to enact legislation and allocate funds when the nation's schools are short 180,000 teachers.  The shortage of teachers and trained personnel can be met only by the federal government.  \"States and communities\" are either unable or unwilling.</span></p> <p><span>Eisenhower's glossing over the need for Federal action in the teaching field is accompanied by a paucity of concrete recommendations in the closely-related field of teacher-producing higher education.  Although he notes, \"Within ten years we may expect three students in our colleges and universities for every two who are there now, he goes no further in his suggestions than the setting up of an investigating committee.  As any college admissions officer would tell the President, the time for investigations and conferences is over.  The time for aid to higher education is now, not ten years from now.</span></p> <p><span>The President's message, though it has obvious shortcomings, is encouraging to both parents and educators.  It would be even more encouraging if Congress would not only follow Eisenhower's proposals, but also extend and enlarge them.</span></p>"}

In his budget message he requested Congress to appropriate $3,500,000 this year to the National Science Foundation for the project.</span></p> <p><span>It was learned yesterday that a huge 500-600 foot radio telescope is under consideration, and that eventual construction costs of the Observatory may run as high as $25-30,000,000.</span></p> <p><span>Bart J.

It will not be operated by the Federal Government, and no classified defense work is contemplated.  The observatory would be built by the National Science Foundation because no private institution could afford such an extensive project.</span></p> <p><span>\"The United States has been lagging behind in this field recently,\" Bok commented last night, \"and we are very happy that the President has asked this appropriation.\"  The University of Manchester is constructing a 250-foot radio telescope in Jodwell-Banks, England, and one almost as large is under construction in Australia.  There is an 80-foot radio telescope in the Netherlands.  The largest in the United States is a 50-foot model in Washington.</span></p> <p><span>Bok had no comment on a report that someone from the University would be named to direct the observatory, and he pointed out that no final decisions of that nature would be made until Congress definitely appropriates funds.  He hopes that work could begin in the not too distant future, however.</span></p> <p><span>The size of a radio telescope is determined by the diameter of its \"dish,\" a parabolic wire mesh which receives light waves.  Radio telescopes have these advantages over optical telescopes:  they can be used in daylight and in bad weather, and they \"see\" through interstellar dust, a factor making them particularly practical for observing the Milky Way.

{"title": "Ike's Outlook Supported by 3 Economists | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Three University economists last night gave a tentative approval to President Eisenhower's optimistic view of the nation's economy for the coming year.  A fourth economist declined to comment on the grounds that \"nobody knows anything about what's going to happen in the next year.\"</span></p> <p><span>The president and his Council of Economic Advisers, while exulting that the economy has \"broken through to new and higher ground,\" cautioned that prosperity would continue only if proper restraints are employed.</span></p> <p><span>Seymour Harris, professor of Economics, was the only faculty member interviewed who saw a slight business decline as a definite possibility.  \"It's going to be hard to maintain the present rate of consumer credit upon which so much of our prosperity is based,\" he said.  \"The falling off in automobile and housing sales is a first indication of this.\"</span></p> <p><span>Harris urged that \"strong safeguards be taken to reduce the growth of consumer credit.  Congress should authorize the Federal Reserve System to tighten credit, and the System should take steps to reduce bank expansion credit.\"</span></p> <p><span><b>Economy at Peak, Says Slichter</b></span></p> <p><span>University Professor Sumner Slichter himself a frequent adviser to the economic council, agreed that Congress should empower the Federal Reserve to act, but doubted whether the System would need to use such limiting power in the near future.</span></p> <p><span>\"We wouldn't want consumer credit to rise again so fast as it did this past year,\" Slichter said, \"but there's very little chance it will, anyway.  We took up a lot of slack last year in the purchase of cars and other goods, and we were lucky that this coincided with a greatly increased production.  We are practically at production peak now--it may increase this year, but not by much.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"No one expects the economy to expand as fast as it did in 1955,\" commented Professor Wassily Leontieff, \"but there is no reason why it should not stay at an even keel.  The balanced budget without a reduction in taxes is a good sign.\"</span></p> <p><span>Leontieff agreed with Harris and Slichter that any reduction in taxes would be an incitement to inflation, but, like his colleagues, felt that an increase in federal taxation would serve no immediate good.</span></p> <p><span>Professor of Economics Alvin Hansen refused comment other than nothing that \"you can't tell what's going to happen next week or next year.  Everyone is guessing; they hear a reasonable guess and say the same thing.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "Teachers' Active Duty Reduced to Six Months | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Members of the teaching profession can fulfill their military service with three to six months active duty and seven and a half years in the reserve, instead of the usual two years active and six in the active reserves, the government has announced.</span></p> <p><span>The Office of Defense Mobilization has listed teaching along with 23 other occupations, most of them scientific, whose members qualify for the exemption.</span></p> <p><span>John P. Elder, Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, said that the new law might draw more graduate students because of the draft advantages.  \"However, I don't think it is a very admirable way to get now teachers,\" he added.  Elder questioned the quality of people who would become teachers merely to shorten their military service.</span></p> <p><span><b>Teaching Fellow Excluded</b></span></p> <p><span>Major M. J. Mullin of the Boston draft board said that the new law would not apply to teaching fellows.  \"We consider them students first and teachers second, so they retain a student status.\"</span></p> <p><span>John F. Troy, manpower specialist of the Office of Defense Mobilization, stated that the purpose of the law was to help young scientists and researchers continue uninterrupted in their work.  He indicated that the case would have to be reviewed by the local draft board on an individual basis.</span></p> <p><span>\"A further advantage of the law would be that the teachers would not be absent for as long a time when \"the need for them is so desperate,\" Elder added.  The active reserves would only entail attendance at weekly training sessions.</span></p> <p><span><b>Act Voted Last Year</b></span></p> <p><span>The move to cut the active service term of some jobholders was passed under the Reserve Forces Act of 1955, but the specific list of occupations was not issued until last week.</span></p> <p><span>President Eisenhower said that the order was to \"provide for a minimum of disruption to the development of industrial technology and defense-related research.\"</span></p> <p><span>Among the scientific professions listed are:  chemist, design engineer draftsman, geologist, geophysicist, mathematician, microbiologist, physicist and physiologist.</span></p>"}
{"title": "In Retrospect | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>After four years of swimming in a national gold-fish bowl, it is easy for the casual undergraduate to grow as indifferent to the changes within his Cambridge world as to development without.  Perhaps, therefore, our readers will pardon the CRIMSON editors' annual urge to review the past year's developments before they depart from their note-pad pinnacle for more academic file cards.  Our only conclusion at such close range can be that it has been a good year for historians and for sorcerers, and that it has been a year of expansion.</span></p> <p><span>Although history is said to repeat herself anyway, President Pusey and the overseers seemed determined that she not forget Harvard this year.  An Ancient Historian by trade, the president has pointed to the College's past, shown that it has grown by fifty men annually during the last century, and has concluded that it could do so again in the future.  Untutored in mathematics, we felt that the times have changed and that the fact of past expansion has little to do with possibilities for future growth.</span></p> <p><span>Leaving the past to President Pusey, Dean Bundy occupied himself with the future.  Knowingly, he predicted a tuition rise last October.  Lo and behold, in January the prediction came true, as tuition rose to $1000 for next year.  We congratulated Dean Bundy for his oracular powers, and suggested that perhaps tuition should have risen even higher--simultaneously, of course, with scholarship aid.</span></p> <p><span>We approved the extension of the Lamont Library hours to midnight.  But we were sorry to see that the Student Council, which usually spends much of its time agreeing with the administration, thought that extension of Lamont hours was unnecessary--just one week before Librarian Buck announced the change.  It seems the Council jumped on the wrong wave of history this time and got caught in the backwash.</span></p> <p><span>Under the leadership of their new Master and their Senior Tutor, the men at Kirkland House were experimenting.  Early in the fall they began a tutorial program for science majors, designed to acquaint budding scientists with the philosophy of their subject.  Latest reports have it that they are reading about expanding universes.  Even Professorial families may expand to keep pace with the fashion; professors may soon be able to get special grants to educate their children--provided they have children.  We agreed with Malthus in approving this kind of growth.</span></p> <p><span>Rising figures, however, were not restricted to the University population nor to her term bills.  The local barbers upped their prices to $1.50. Unanimously, we labeled this a Bad Thing, and recommended Central Square.</span></p> <p><span>While thus taking a long, but critical view of the local scene, we inclined to take a dim view of the world in general, Although the CRIMSON's Executive Board was Republican, its Editorial Board remained largely Democratic.  Predicted chaos, however, did not arise in this non-election year.  The paper managed to steer a moderate course, somewhat to the left of President Eisenhower, and considerably to the right of former President Truman.  While we took comparatively few swipes at the president himself, we could not resist his Secretary of State.</span></p> <p><span>Concerning the most pressing national question of all--the alleged \"natural superiority of the Ivy League\"--we agreed with Holiday Magazine that it was, but thought it wasn't very \"Ivy League\" to say so.</span></p> <p><span>Thus overlooking many other important events of the twelve months past, we wash the printer's ink from our hands and make our exit, thanking our readers for their interest and for their tolerance.</span></p>"}
