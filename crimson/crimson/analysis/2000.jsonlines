John S. McCai' candidacy, Texas Gov. George W. Bush hopes to finally lock up the Republican nomination today.</span></p> <p><span>Bush had hoped to have the contest wrapped up back in New Hampshire, but a flood of independent and  Democratic primary voters have</span></p> <p><span>tightened the Republican race. Bush has struggled to attract voters outside of the main Republican base.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond Bush's claim of a \"compassionate conservatism,\" he mixes old-party line Republican policy with new conservative ideology. The issues Bush has trumpeted on the campaign trail include his tax cut proposals and educational reforms.</span></p> <p><span>Bush is pushing for tax cuts of $483 billion over five years, which will cut the top tax rate to 33 percent along with lower income tax brackets. There will be $8 billion worth of tax incentives for charitable conversations.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's education incentive program focuses on supporting charter schools and school voucher programs. Bush supports starting a $3 billion charter school fund along with tying voucher programs to a nationwide \"accountability\" system.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's crime platform is based on a \"tough love\" philosophy. He supports the death penalty and wants to strengthen juvenile crime sentences and sentences for gun offenses. Bush also supports limited forms of gun control, such as gun show background checks and banning guns in school areas. But he is a proponent of the right to carry concealed weapons.</span></p> <p><span>Politically, Bush has yet to fully recover from his visit to Bob Jones University, whose founders are have criticized Catholicism. He wrote an apologetic letter last week to New York Cardinal John O'Connor, but he has struggled to reconcile his actions with his rhetoric that he is a \"uniter, not a divider.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bush, more than any other candidate, has incorporated his personal faith into his campaign policy and rhetoric. He proclaimed Jesus Christ as his hero during an Iowa Republican debate and has outlined 'faith-based' initiatives.</span></p> <p><span>Specifically, he has called for the lifting of federal regulations to help allow religious organizations assist the poor. He also wants the government to provide tax credits to encourage charitable gifts.</span></p> <p><span>After graduating from Yale in 1968 with a history degree, Bush entered the Texas Air National Guard for five years, serving his country far from Vietnam's shores.  After being rejected from the University of Texas Law School, Bush was accepted at Harvard Business School, where he graduated in 1975.</span></p> <p><span>He started an oil-drilling business upon his return to Texas, and flirted with political office with his 1978 run for the U.S. House. After his loss, he did not return to political work until 1987, when he helped out his father's presidential campaign. After a successful run as a part-owner of the  Texas Ranger baseball team, he ran for Texas Governor in 1994, won and was reelected in 1998.</span></p>"}

Kim '01 of the Harvard Current happened upon an advertisement for Ariz. Senator John S. McCain on an Asian pornographic website. In an e-mail message, Kim said she was \"surfing for a story that was at once sexy and serious.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Current recently released the story to several national news services, including the Drudge Report and abcnews.com who both published the news online. If McCain has been advertising on pornographic web sites, what are Republican values coming to?</span></p> <p><span>In a campaign where all of the candidates' skeletons have been marching out of their respective closets, McCain must be feeling left out. How can he compete with Bush's alleged cocaine habit or Al Gore's marijuana stint? He needs pizzazz for the polls. He needs sex.</span></p> <p><span>Let's face it: Sex sells. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch knows it, Larry Flynt depends on it and even our esteemed President has dabbled in it. So why should McCain miss out on all the fun?</span></p> <p><span>After all, McCain prides himself on his appeal to younger voters, so what better way to connect with Generation Y than through Internet pornography, that upstart competitor to the old-school Playboy institution? In fact, Internet porn could be seen as a metaphor for the McCain campaign; rebellious, accessible to the masses and dominated by anti-establishment personalities.</span></p> <p><span>All joking aside, the American public has suffered a deluge of sex, scandal, gossip and embarrassment in the past year, and frankly it's getting a little old. Do we really think that McCain intentionally put an advertisement on a pornographic website? And, even if he did, should it matter? The presidential election should be based on issues, not the blips in character that make good sound bites or headlines.</span></p> <p><span>Time and time again, it has been argued that Americans need a President with character. But shouldn't Americans elect someone who will address issues of importance, keep the economy blossoming and work hard on foreign policy issues?</span></p> <p><span>It is not to say that character should not play any part of a decision to elect someone as President, but the types of faults that have been paraded as serious character flaws simply are not. Some drug use in college does not mean that a candidate is unfit to be President. An accidental advertisement on an porn website should not be grounds to question a candidate's moral makeup.</span></p> <p><span>This incident should give the candidates the opportunity to admit their fallibility, and instead of vilifying one another, they should actually debate the issues at hand. What could be sexier than that?</span></p>"}

Who are these people who think their call is more important than everyone else in the room? They must have been accepted to Harvard, yet can't figure out how to turn their phones off, even after the first ring during a class. Few things are more obnoxious or distracting in the lecture hall.</span></p> <p><span>\"First Nights\" covers material from Monteverdi to Stravinsky. But the fact that your phone happens to play one of these tunes for its ring is absolutely no excuse. Professor Kelly's lectures may fulfill your Lit-Arts B requirement, but the digital polyphony of multiple ringing nuisances will not. And if your phone rings \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,\" it isn't any better.</span></p> <p><span>Dartboard also wonders what kind of urgent calls these students are getting at 10 in the morning. Are McKinsey recruiters ringing the star Ec concentrators with offers of multi-million dollar contracts? Are the Gov jocks waiting for a personal appeal from Gore or Bush? Is there an illicit network of drug deals going down on campus? Get a grip: we're all students, and we should show a little more respect for our esteemed professors and our classmates.</span></p> <p><span>It's one thing if you live in the Quad and never make it home. But it still doesn't explain why you can't remember to turn the phone off--even if your significant other needs his or her regular check-ins. And for those TFs who've let their phones ring in section, it doesn't make you seem cool or important, just incompetent. So please: save our sanity and your Geiger counts--cancer's no fun.

{"title": "The Earth Before the Bench | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The quality of the air you breathe is on the line in this year's election. And the purity of your drinking water. And whether polluters will have to pay to clean up the cancer-causing chemicals they've left in the Hudson River, the Great Lakes and waters across America.</span></p> <p><span>That's because the next President will likely appoint several Justices to the Supreme Court, which, depending on the wisdom of those choices, could imperil the environmental progress we have achieved.</span></p> <p><span>Over the past 30 years, our nation has substantially cleaned up our air and water--thanks to citizen enforcement lawsuits, tough federal laws that regulate interstate pollution and the ability of Congress and executive agencies to employ modern, innovative solutions to environmental problems as our society grows more complicated. However, conservative Justice Antonin Scalia has been leading an effort on the Supreme Court to revive obscure legal doctrines that restrict the ability of the government and citizens to protect our environment. If the next President appoints more Justices in the mold of Justice Scalia, our environmental standards are at grave risk.</span></p> <p><span>And a conservative Scalia Court is not just a doomsday prediction: Texas Gov. George W. Bush publicly stated on \"Meet the Press\" one year ago yesterday that Justice Scalia is his model for a Supreme Court Justice.</span></p> <p><span>While scholarly and accomplished, Justice Scalia advocates a judicial philosophy that looks backwards into the 19th century and that seeks to roll back years of environmental progress.</span></p> <p><span>Leading legal scholars consider Justice Scalia the most anti-environmental Justice ever to sit on the Supreme Court. Even other conservative Justices, such as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, often disagree with Justice Scalia in environmental cases because of his failure to acknowledge scientific progress.</span></p> <p><span>The Scalia philosophy would slam the courthouse door shut on citizens bold enough to seek to enforce environmental laws that safeguard our air and water, defend our wildlife heritage and protect communities from toxic pollution. When Congress passed the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act and Endangered Species Act, these laws gave people the power to file lawsuits to prevent environmental crimes and protect their families' health without having to wait on the slow grind of government's gears. But Justice Scalia would strip citizens of the power to protect their families from pollution.</span></p> <p><span>For example, in a case decided earlier this year, Justice Scalia expressed horror that a person who lives near a polluting plant would be able to hold the company accountable for violating the law. Justice Scalia argued that the Court was making it too easy for people to fight environmental threats in their own neighborhoods. Never mind that the factory in question had poisoned a river by dumping toxic mercury into the water 489 separate times.</span></p> <p><span>The good news is that Justice Scalia was in the minority and that his views did not prevail that time. But that could change if the next President were to add more like-minded Justices to the Supreme Court.</span></p> <p><span>It's not only citizen enforcement suits authorized by Congress that draw Justice Scalia's anger. He also opposes efforts to enact uniform national laws to address nationwide problems. Air and water pollution respect no borders. People in downstream states have no ability to protect themselves from upstream pollution without strong federal protective laws. But, for the first time in generations, federal courts and the Supreme Court in particular are on the brink of turning the clock back to a time when the citizenry--including industries--was at the mercy of a crazy quilt of inconsistent and often grossly inadequate state laws.</span></p> <p><span>Additionally, this year the Supreme Court faces the question whether a long-dead legal doctrine will prevent Congress from protecting the nation from air pollution. And it is widely anticipated that Justice Scalia will side with the 19th century, preventing the Environmental Protection Agency from applying scientific data to tackle our complex air pollution problems. Last year, a lower federal court struck down new, greatly improved soot and smog standards. Will the Supreme Court allow us to keep our air clean? While the question hangs in the air, pollution burns the lungs of people suffering from asthma.</span></p> <p><span>The environment will suffer profoundly if the next President packs the Supreme Court with members who share Justice Scalia's disdain for the legal means Americans have used to clean up our air and water. While the next President will only be in office four to eight years, his legacy on the Supreme Court could harm our environment and our communities for more than a generation.</span></p> <p><span><i>Robert Cox is president of the Sierra Club and professor of communication studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</i></span></p>"}
{"title": "Confusion in Camp? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Al Gore must be shaking with restrained delight. Why, you ask? Right now, it doesn't seem like he has much to chuckle about. His post-convention bounce (which put him nearly 10 points ahead of Bush) has evened out into a statistical neck-and-neck. Yes, it looks like the debates will fall out in his favor, but Dubya could easily come from behind armed with the \"character issue\" and take home the pie. The election looks to be the tightest and most competitive in recent history. So why is Gore so happy? Because finally, finally, finally, he's no longer number two. Imagine being a respectable, monogamous, married gentleman from a well-established southern family. Now imagine spending eight years as the subordinate to a randy Arkansas governor. Finally, Al Gore is no longer identified as the President's drone, I mean, clone. Clinton who?</span></p> <p><span>But apparently, someone forgot to pass the Clinton camp that memo. At a reception I happened to hear Norman Mineta, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, say that if Gore were elected, \"He hoped to be on for another four years.\" Interesting that one of the men in charge of the country doesn't realize that the last thing Gore wants around if elected is a former member of the Clinton administration--other than himself.</span></p> <p><span>Professor of Government Paul E. Peterson agrees. \"[Former V.P.s become president] pretty much start over. Few feel constrained to keep someone from the previous cabinet, unless it is a luminary. No one fits the bill this time around.\"</span></p> <p><span>So how did Secretary Mineta get this crazy idea? Well, perhaps Bill and Al are having some communication issues. It wouldn't be the first time. Gore and Clinton did not seem to be totally in sync during the convention. The New York Times reported that Clinton raised almost as much money for his presidential library as Gore did for his election. After that, Clinton left the country to tour Africa leaving Gore centerstage. He is limiting himself to Millenium Summits and other goodwill endeavors that are appropriate for a President but where little occurs except photo-ops.</span></p> <p><span>It seems, however, that some in-fighting may remain among their little people. Each camp seems to be saying something different. Devona Dolliole, Deputy National Spokesperson for the Gore/Lieberman campaign, chose not to comment on Al Gore's potential cabinet. However, as she was no-commenting she made a couple of (Freudian) slips. She called Democratic nominee the V.P. and then promptly corrected herself. \"I mean Al Gore,\" she said. I guess they're hoping people will forget that big bad Bill Clinton is still Gore's boss.</span></p> <p><span>She then referred to Bill Clinton as the V.P.</span></p> <p><span>A few moments later, spokesperson Jason Schecter assured me that the Clinton-Gore relationship had not changed at all in the eight years they had worked together. He said that Gore \"and Clinton talk frequently. He [Gore] is, after all, a part of the Clinton administration.\"</span></p> <p><span>When I asked Dolliole to comment on the relationship between Al and Bill, she was less forthcoming, \"Mr. Gore is trying to focus on the campaign right now.\"</span></p> <p><span>So Gore is secretly telling people that Clinton is the true number two while Clinton is whispering to members of his administration like Mineta that Gore will retain them once elected. I guess those two are on the same page.</span></p> <p><span>So who's right? Well, those like Mineta who are hoping to be kept on will most likely be disappointed. Presidents far more influential than Clinton have tried and failed to extend their presidential influence after their terms ended. It never worked. Teddy Roosevelt, one of the most popular Presidents ever, practically handpicked his successor Taft. Once in office, however, Taft ceased to be the former-President's pawn and replaced all of Teddy's people with lawyers. Of course, Teddy was livid and journeyed back from his African safari to run for President again. He lost.</span></p> <p><span>You can't take it with you.</span></p> <p><span>Secretary Norman Mineta, however, still has reason to hope. Many former VPs have kept the former president's cabinet when the president died or was deposed during office. Mineta can always pray for Clinton to catch a sudden case of pneumonia as Harrison did from making a speech without a hat on. Or, since Ford did keep all of Nixon's cabinet, he can hope for a second impeachment.</span></p> <p><span>If Mineta would rather not harbor such macabre illusions there is always another chance. According to Brett Flehinger, Professor of History, there are cases of members of the cabinet going on to be elected President (like President Hoover). So if Gore is elected and decides to ask for Mineta's resignation, he can always run to become the big cheese himself in 2004. Here's to hoping.</span></p> <p><span><i>Christina S.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>After two hours of speeding north on I-95 in a shaky car with variable heating, we found ourselves in the \"metropolis\" of Manchester, New Hampshire. We were greeted by dirty ice and hordes of microwave trucks filled with television equipment and towering masts. Following a local's directions down Canal Street, we wandered to StrangeBrew, a local pub. Inside was a raucous scene: blinding lights, drunken men, officious politicians, self-important television executives and a makeshift stage. As we trailed into the bar, Adam Levine and Phil Griffin, executive producers of NBC's \"Hardball,\" belted \"Harvard!\" at the tops of their voices. We were led down to a center table in front of the stage and instructed to sit and be good Harvard students. Due to our dumb luck, we were special guests to the show that evening--not that we had any idea of what we were doing.</span></p> <p><span>A few of us had met Adam, Phil and the star of \"Hardball,\" Chris Matthews, while they watched their own TV show in Charlie's Kitchen about a week before. After too much snow stalled their trip home to New York, they found respite in the local beer and triple cheeseburgers of this venerable Cambridge establishment. Jenn Hyman '02 and myself just happened to be sitting next to them as they explained some of the nuances of network television to two ignorant media devotees. Chris Matthews argued with Dick Gephardt on TV in front of us while prodding us about how his St. Alban's son could sneak past the admissions office and get into Harvard. We became buddies during the bizarre meeting and before finishing our drinks, we were invited to attend a broadcast of the New Hampshire primary the following week.</span></p> <p><span>Once we entered StrangeBrew, we were clueless. Surrounded by crazed and efficient NBC people, we needed to have a plan of action. Franklin proposed drinks; Noah suggested dinner. While fending off surreptitious stares (we look too young to be politically significant) we tried to force down French fries and ginger ale. Our chairs were arranged to suit the camera, and we were requested to remain in place until \"Hardball\" aired live at 8 p.m. Constantly surrounded by gorgeous women toting cell phones and looking inquisitively into his eyes, Paul kept joking about our presence. Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci showed up with his progeny and some extremely obnoxious hangers-on while we checked out a fashionable, blonde woman in trendy spectacles. While not so into the political scene, we were down with the media aspect of the New Hampshire primary. Jenn couldn't believe she wore pink to be on TV, Franklin  Leonard '00 wondered why he was the only African-American in the bar and Jordana started dialing family members to demand they turn on their sets.</span></p> <p><span>And, on TV we were. The floor manager, an imposing woman with a tight pony-tail, taught us to applaud wildly, shut-the-hell-up quickly and listen intently to Chris Matthews as he interrogated Alan Simpson and Jack Kemp. We could feel our faces burn from the sweltering lights and from the knowledge that we had no right to be in the middle of an NBC show proffering wisdom on the primaries. We write for FM, not The New Republic. Noah Oppenheim '00, the closest we had to a guru on political affairs, was the spokesman. The rest of us had to try and look intellectual. With the first notes of music, Chris started the program: \"John McCain stole the show from George W. Bush for the Republican Party, and it looks like George can't use Mummy and Daddy for votes. Let's play Hardball.\" As he glared menacingly at the camera, we suppressed our laughter. The camerawoman kept zooming in on Jordana Lewis' '02 quintessential academic look and then panning over to Franklin's studied determination. At every commercial, we could watch ourselves on the monitor to the left and comment about who got the most airtime. Noah's face continued to pale as his fifteen seconds of fame loomed over him. But the patrons swilled locally brewed Shipyard Ale and hooted uproariously as the floor manager grabbed her microphone and told us all to keep quiet. And then, after countless cracks at Bush, diatribes from Cellucci, praise from Simpson, analysis from Capital Hill think tankers and ranting and raving from good old Chris, the early evening show wrapped up. Again we were on TV, but silent and glaring.</span></p> <p><span>People stormed the stage after the last commercial and Phil and Adam approached us again with toothy grins. The eleven o'clock show awaited. Behind him, an officious manager, chugging golden whiskey while sucking on cigarettes, hissed at us to be back to the set on time. Noah got up and approached guest Jonathan Alter, a former Crimson editor and current Newsweek correspondent. As Noah spoke, the rest of us surrounded him in a silent circle. But luckily, Alter took our silence as pure awe and invited us to follow him over to the Gore campaign party. Although none of us were enamored with the stoic VP, we decided that his shindig would be thoroughly more intriguing than trailing McCain to Nashua. Skating across the ice to the lovely Holiday Inn, we followed Alter as he described his work at the magazine and his exhilaration on election night. We, plebian, pseudo-media, desperately attempted to compare our work to his, but before we made bigger fools of ourselves, we ran into the real fools: Gore supporters.</span></p> <p><span>Half-drunken fans mingled with obsequious IOP-types and secret service men. We followed Alter into a giant cathedral warehouse where acres of laptops and television monitors and telephones and fax machines made a tremendous racket. Hunched journalists, attached to their keyboards and notebooks madly created copy while mumbling into phones and cursing sporadically; a wall of television screens flashed campaign coverage from every imaginable channel--except FOX--they preferred \"Party of Five\" over McCain. Huddled together, we stared at this splendor of technology and manpower. Alter flew off to another interview, and Franklin spied his heroine, Arianna Huffington while I discovered my hometown hero, the Boston Globe columnist, Mike Barnicle. Granted, he resigned from the Globe after they discovered his tendency to \"fabrication,\" but he's still the best thing the Globe ever had. With his arms folded across his chest, he seemed mildly pleased to hear I was from The Crimson, but he too soon disappeared for a TV interview.</span></p> <p><span>Jenn tried to crash the Gore party, but the loud music and cheering inside was just an illusion. Only a small number of people had been screened by the secret service and invited to his contrived victory celebration. Huffington accosted us on the way out, so we listened to her strange and lilting accent while she towered above us all like a veritable Amazon warrior. She handed us a pamphlet for her latest cause, \"OverthrowtheGov.com,\" and posed for a photo. We were once again unstoppable, pretending that our Harvard ID and driver's license would work as a press pass. While one intrepid UPN reporter said he had a \"chat session\" inside and attempted to push by us, we prevailed and stormed the Gore party as official student press--but to no avail. We were barricaded in pen built for large sows and forced to watch the revelers behind the wall. After about 10 seconds of looking at Gore's chiseled chin, we chatted with the drug-sniffing dog, proffered our handbags filled with AK-47s to the secret service and left. Only to bump into some men dressed as pigs. We think they were protesting porkbarrel spending.</span></p> <p><span>On our way back to the \"Hardball\" set, we were euphoric. McCain had won; Gore had prevailed. Not that many citizens seemed to care. They were happier to gather at the bar, watch the brouhaha of producers and set managers, and comment on the attractiveness of the upcoming, female political analysts. This time, we really were going to be famous, because we were primped and prepped and handed a microphone. Again, in the front row of the set, next to an angry man in a dirty T-shirt who really wanted to ask a question about Gore, we tried to keep from eyeing the camera. Noah, holding a copy of The Crimson's endorsement of McCain and Bradley, was told to be brief--he was now an \"official\" commentator on the political scene. He twitched his shoulders and got ready for his big television debut. During a commercial break after a tirade from Simpson and a lecture from the Newsweek analyst, Howard Fineman, Matthews leaned down to us, and said \"Keep it short. Use small words and DON'T BE A TIME HOG.\" Apparently he understood Harvard students to be unnaturally loquacious. Noah braced himself, and when Chris held up a copy of The Crimson to the screen and announced that Hardball was suddenly becoming intellectual, he turned to Noah and asked him why we chose McCain as our choice for president. I barely remember what he said, but it was good because all the real authorities agreed and deemed we were collectively intelligent. The rest of us just sat there and nodded.</span></p> <p><span>After we wrapped for the night, StrangeBrew was abuzz with people and various campaign supporters. Bradley's issue director approached us, announced he was from Yale and walked off. The stress of the two live shows was over, television executives and the Newsweek clan gathered in booths along the back of the bar. Everything was charged to the \"Hardball\" account, and we were left to mingle with people who were once only bylines. After Howard Fineman scoffed at my Boston roots (\"Why go to Harvard?\") and lectured on the merits of journalism and the lack of credibility of Cornell West, he sat back and demanded to know our future plans. The producers of the Evening News with Tom Brokaw--and Tom Brokaw himself--turned around and glanced us up and down. The female executive producer faced us and in a beautifully measured voice commented briefly on her job as a producer and her affection for late-night programming. In a flash, all my allegiance to print was gone. But then she turned away, more interested in NBC gossip than a group of drooling Harvard kids. And kids we were, next to these people who had managed to scramble up the media ladder. We certainly saw what it takes to be a TV executive: aggression. Tom Brokaw too was not terribly interested by our non-credentials, but Phil convinced him to approach us and proffer some words of wisdom. Slathered with taupe make-up, Brokaw embraced us, muttered the word \"Harvard,\" smiled and told us we were great as we tried to subtly beg for a photo. Brokaw even gave Jenn a big fat kiss on the cheek which she proudly reminded us of on the way home. We reminded her that the venerable Brokaw had added some drinks of his own to the Hardball tab.</span></p> <p><span>Phil and Adam, ever charming, invited us all to South Carolina to the next big \"Hardball\" event. However, after an unbelievable influx of media and politics--a real \"out of the box\" experience--we had to return home to fair Harvard. Somehow, the real world looked a whole lot better--if politics can count as reality. We watched the lights come down from the rafters and Chris Matthews slip into trench coat to depart. For most of New Hampshire, the night was over. Gore and McCain were surely going to bed happy only to wake up to another day in another state. We finally attained our few moments of vicarious fame, and had to go home on the slick roads only to wake up and shop English 10b in the morning.</span></p>"}

Along with University officials, many contribute money to election campaigns.</span></p> <p><span>So whom do Harvard professors support?</span></p> <p><span>Since the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and several privately-run web sites publish most of the data about campaign contributions, The Crimson decided to take a look--and found some problems with how the FEC collects its data. Some Harvard officials deny making the contributions listed on official donation websites.</span></p> <p><span>One of those websites, www.tray.com, which is run by a former FEC official, cross-lists donors by name, occupation, place of employment and zip code. Interested citizens are a few clicks away from finding who donates to who.

(Stanford and Princeton are the only other universities whose employees have given more).</span></p> <p><span>George W. Bush has received a bit more than $10,000 from rival Harvardians. FEC records show that Yale has only given the Texas Governor a fifth of that total.</span></p> <p><span>Since the current presidential election campaign began in earnest more than a year ago, 13 professors from the Harvard Business School (HBS) were contributors. The Kennedy School of Government had nine donors, the Harvard Law School had six, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences had four, and the Harvard Medical school and Graduate School of Education had three donors each.</span></p> <p><span>It's not surprising that business school professors make up the largest plurality of the Harvard donor cohort, says Theda C. Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm sure they're in a better position to donate than anyone else,\" she says.\tWhile HBS faculty financial support appears evenly divided between Democratic candidate Bradley and Republican candidate Bush, most Kennedy School faculty donations went to Democratic candidate Gore. Several members of the Kennedy School faculty--including Willian Julius Wilson and Elaine Kamarck--have either publicly declared their support for Gore or advised the candidate himself.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy School sociologist Christopher Jencks is a top Bradley advisor and gave the candidate $1,000, the maximum allowable by campaign finance rules.</span></p> <p><span>Steven J. Kelman '70, a professor of public management at the John F. Kennedy School of Government (KSG), said that the outside world perceives Harvard's faculty as skewed to the left.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm not sure [the perception] is true,\" he says. \"I don't think the Harvard faculty is as uniformly democratic or liberal as many outsiders think.\" He says that the opinions of Harvard faculty may be divided more evenly along political lines, but that the Republican-leaning professors may not contribute as much as the Democratic-leaning professors.</span></p> <p><span>Kelman, a Gore supporter, said he thinks that the KSG faculty appreciates Gore's commitment to the reinventing government program. He said working for a better government in \"a low visibility program for which you don't get many brownie points\" is \"what the Kennedy School is really all about.\"</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Trendy Professors </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Some professors save their giving for off-year elections--when political parties tap core donors to try and support Congressional and Senatorial candidates.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>In 1998, Skocpol gave $218 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

When it was time to report to the FEC, campaign workers found the Harvard Ryan's name in a directory of lawyers and recorded his information in their files.</span></p> <p><span>\"I said, 'How do you draw the conclusion that Allan Ryan III who gave you money from New York is the same as Allan Ryan Jr. from Cambridge, Mass. who didn't?'\" Ryan recalls. \"The thing that strikes me is that this is something they are required to do by law...and they're just throwing [the information] around.\"</span></p> <p><span>Law and compliance are important parts of the campaign finance effort. Campaign staffs have entire teams of lawyers and accountants dedicated to ensuring that each and every donor is a legal one.</span></p> <p><span>Professor of Education Howard Gardner is reported to have given $250 to the legal and accounting compliance division of the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election effort.</span></p> <p><span>Gardner, whose home address is the one listed on tray.com with his donation, says that he did not make the donation, and his assistant wrote in an e-mail message that the Howard Gardner who made the donation is not the Harvard professor.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Liberal but not Lonely </b><p> </p><p></p></font>The Harvard faculty is not alone in its support of liberal candidates.

{"title": "Campaign 2000, A to Z | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>For those of you too busy with shopping classes over the past few weeks to follow the goings-on on the campaign trail, here is a quick and painless introduction to campaign 2000. This is a glossary of sorts, detailing what you need to know to be an informed citizen and voter in the primary elections. Campaign 2000, A to Z:</span></p> <p><span>Arkansas. Thankfully, we can now forget that this state ever existed.</span></p> <p><span>Basketball. Bill Bradley was a professional basketball player. A few years ago, while playing a pick-up basketball game with members of Congress, Al Gore '69 broke his leg and spent six months in a cast. Chalk one up for Bradley.</span></p> <p><span>Cream Soda. Bill Bradley has blamed his recurring heart arrhythmia on his switch to drinking diet cream soda, which contains caffeine. He has since switched to diet orange soda. But what sort of a presidential beverage is diet orange soda?</span></p> <p><span>Dixville Notch. Residents of this small town in northern New Hampshire were the first in the nation to cast their ballots. There are about 25 voters there. They vote Republican.</span></p> <p><span>Electors. As you'll remember from high school civics, we don't actually vote for the President. We vote for the electors, who vote for the President. For an interesting take on the electors, read the fictional account that CNN journalist Jeff Greenfield wrote several years ago, on what might happen if the president-elect is killed by a horse. But no matter--we all know that the media picks the president, anyway.</span></p> <p><span>Felons. In most states, convicted felons are not allowed to vote. In Massachusetts, they may; at times, they've even held public office. Both Democratic candidates have showed a willingness to review the much-criticized current law on the matter, which should ensure a Democratic victory in Concord, Framingham and Walpole.</span></p> <p><span>Guam. George W. Bush is the only candidate with an office in Guam. They usually vote Democratic, but maybe not this year. Guam is not to be confused with American Samoa, where Dan Quayle made his famous \"happy campers\" speech.</span></p> <p><span>Hillary. Would she have such a love for New York if it weren't an open seat?</span></p> <p><span>Iowa. A state with a unique primary system, in which voters listen to candidates talk about farming, then go to a local high school gym and stand in the corner to be counted.</span></p> <p><span>Jenny Craig. In the most intriguing \"political ad\" of the season, Monica Lewinsky's commercial for the Jenny Craig diet sure beats the ad with George W. Bush in a sweater.</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy. What would an election year be without the Kennedys. Two are running for re-election this year: Ted and Patrick.</span></p> <p><span>Late-night TV. A campaign can be won or lost on the late-night TV talk shows--remember Bill Clinton and his saxophone on Arsenio? Already, we've seen Hillary on Letterman. Can other candidates be far behind?</span></p> <p><span>Manchurian. In the 1962 John Frankenheimer film The Manchurian Candidate, a former POW war hero is brainwashed and becomes an assassin in a Communist plot to take over the presidency. John McCain is known in certain circles as \"The Manchurian Candidate.\"</span></p> <p><span>November. The presidential election will be held on November 7, 2000.</span></p> <p><span>Open Primary. For those of you who are not registered as either Democrats or Republicans (\"unenrolled\"), don't fret. In an open primary system, like that in Massachusetts, you can vote too. This means that the liberal-leaning among you could take a Republican ballot and vote for the candidate least likely to win.</span></p> <p><span>PAC Money. The true engine of the electoral process, funds from political action committees (PAC) are the big bucks that pay for a modern media campaign. Individual contributions, however, are often more interesting. Data from the candidates' mandatory Federal Election Commission filings are on the web, and searchable at www.tray.com/fecinfo. (Try searching for zip code 02138.)</span></p> <p><span>Quizzes. Should our president be able to name the leader of Pakistan? The pop quiz craze, prompted by a Boston political reporter's questions for George W. Bush about world leaders, seems to have passed. Apparently, it only served to remind voters how little they know about world news.</span></p> <p><span>Register. In order to vote in the Massachusetts presidential primary on March 7th, you must have registered to vote by yesterday, February 16.</span></p> <p><span>South Carolina. A very important primary. Also, land of Strom Thurmond and the Confederate flag. I'm taking wagers on which one will go first.</span></p> <p><span>\"Time.\" Boston for political fundraiser. Usage: \"We met at Ted Kennedy's time.\"</span></p> <p><span>Underwear. In 1992, an MTV viewer asked candidate Clinton the famous question, \"boxers or briefs?\" In 2000, we don't want to know.</span></p> <p><span>Vice President. Unfortunately, this year's vice presidential contest is unlikely to provide a more classic campaign moment than the 1992 three-way vice presidential debate between Gore, Quayle and Stockdale. When Stockdale looked into the camera and asked, \"Who am I? Why am I here?,\" a new era of political existentialism was launched. The political process is still recovering.</span></p> <p><span>W. Nickname for George W. Bush.</span></p> <p><span>X-Files. How else do you explain Steve Forbes?</span></p> <p><span>Yale. George W. Bush went to Yale. Bill Bradley went to Princeton. Al Gore '69 went to Harvard. You make the call.</span></p> <p><span>Zzzzzzzzz. This campaign is poised to become the most boring in recent memory. Here's hoping for some interesting moments in the upcoming primary season. Candidate John S. McCain, quoted in the New York Times, said the following: \"I think humor is really important. I've thought it was important all my life. I think it's important in these kind of, what sometimes get to be high-pressure situations.\" I wholeheartedly agree.</span></p> <p><span>Noelle Eckley '00 is a environmental science and public policy concentrator in Dunster House.

Reeves '72 after Harvard Students for Peace in Vieques, Now! presented the idea to him.</span></p> <p><span>Mayoral elections dominated the meeting, which ended with Anthony D. Galluccio's 1:30 a.m. swearing-in as the city's top official in City Hall's Sullivan Chamber.</span></p> <p><span>But more than six hours earlier, Hans S. Perl-Matanzo '01, Kimberly M. Sanchez '03 and Antonio J. Torres, a member of the National Conference for Puerto Rican Rights, spoke before the council, urging its members to pass the resolution urging the Navy to \"return the land to the municipality of Vieques for civilian uses.\"</span></p> <p><span>Perl-Matanzo said the Navy has been a destructive presence on the island since it first established a base there 59 years ago.</span></p> <p><span>\"The more than 30,000 residents of Vieques were forced to live in 29 percent of the island, while the U.S. Navy appropriated over 70 percent of the land to establish a live-bombing practice site,\" said Perl-Matanzo, who is the founder and director of the Harvard student group.</span></p> <p><span>\"Fifty percent of the Vieques population is unemployed and a whopping 70 percent live under the poverty line,\" he added.</span></p> <p><span>Sanchez said the Navy's bombing practices on the island have greatly harmed the island's environment.</span></p> <p><span>\"Vieques has more craters per square meter than the surface of the moon,\" Sanchez said.</span></p> <p><span>By passing the resolution, she said, the council could influence other legislators and decision-makers in the U.S. and put additional pressure on the Navy to leave the island.</span></p> <p><span>Copies of the resolution will now be sent to President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore '69, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, Navy Secretary John H. Dalton, Gov. Pedro J. Rossello of Puerto Rico and other influential officials.</span></p> <p><span>Clinton agreed last month to allow Puerto Ricans to hold a referendum on the Vieques situation.</span></p> <p><span>Puerto Ricans would have two options: they could vote either to let the Navy resume use of its firing range \"on its own terms\" in exchange for new federal financial aid or order the Navy to cease all training at its base by May 1, 2003. A date for the referendum has not been set.</span></p> <p><span>At Harvard, about 60 faculty members have signed a petition calling for the withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Vieques, Sanchez said.</span></p> <p><span>Those who have signed the petition include Warburg Professor of Economics Emeritus John Kenneth Galbraith, Fletcher University Professor Cornel R. West '74 and Du Bois Professor of the Humanities Henry Louis \"Skip\" Gates Jr.</span></p> <p><span>Before the council voted for the resolution shortly after 11 p.m., Reeves added his own perspective, as he has frequently done since he assumed the role of acting chair of the council Jan. 10.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is a major issue nationally and internationally,\" Reeves said. \"These emerging economies are beginning to wonder why they're entertaining this sort of destruction where people live.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"We're test-bombing in their backyards, and they're not happy about it,\" Reeves added.</span></p> <p><span>At the time of his remarks last night, Reeves had emerged to gain a surprising lead in the mayor's race with three votes--three more than he had at the beginning of the evening. Two and a half hours later, however, Galluccio was elected as the successor to former mayor Francis H.

{"title": "A Flag That Deserves No Salute | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Should the Confederate battle flag, to many a symbol of racism and slavery, fly atop the South Carolina state house? Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John S. McCain, the two front-runners in the GOP primary there Saturday, have been frantically evading the question for weeks.</span></p> <p><span>Bush, asked repeatedly about the flag on the campaign trail, says he thinks South Carolinians should decide the issue for themselves. McCain, days after calling the flag offensive in January, changed his mind and in a terse statement said he saw the flag as \"a symbol of heritage,\" despite the fact that the flag was not flown over the state house until 1962, when South Carolina politicians wished to mark their resistance to the civil rights movement during a Civil War centennial.</span></p> <p><span>Neither candidate has mustered the courage to risk Republican votes in the primary, an early contest that both candidates consider crucially important, by denouncing the flag. These are men who want to be president, and their gutless pandering on such a clear-cut issue is disturbing. The flag's supporters claim it is a reminder of South Carolina's heritage. They are right. The flag is a reminder of a history of slavery and prejudice--something no state government should honor, and certainly something no president should condone.</span></p> <p><span>The two Democratic candidates have both recognized this and come out against the flag, and the governor of the state is calling for a compromise to move it from the state house. Bush and McCain would be wise to follow their lead. Until they do, both will suffer nationally for a short-term political advantage in South Carolina. Bush is running as a \"compassionate conservative\" reaching out to minorities, but is unable to condemn a racist emblem. Meanwhile, McCain runs the risk that his carefully crafted image as the principled maverick of the Republican race will begin to look a little fake as he dances around the flag controversy.</span></p> <p><span>Forty years after it was flown to protest the extension of civil rights to African-Americans, the flag is still an embarrassing reminder of what to most people is a shameful past. Men who want to be president of the United States, of all people, must have the courage to condemn it.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Editorial Notebook: The Best Things Are What Money Can't Buy | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In an uplifting political moment last Thursday, Steve Forbes dropped out of the race for the Republican nomination--only, of course, after spending $66 million over the past six years. Many political critics recognize a candidate's need for money to run an effective campaign. Forbes' failure, however, assures the American people that although one may need money to succeed, it still takes more than dollar bills to win an election. A candidate needs not only a vision for the future, but also a constituency of people who agree with him--while not being on his payroll.</span></p> <p><span>Forbes made his decision to bow out of the race after his disappointing third place finish in the Delaware primary. He had won in Delaware in 1996 with just 33 percent of the vote, but although he spent more time and money there this year than any other candidate, Forbes lost last week to Sen. John S. McCain (R-Ariz.). McCain decided not to campaign at all in the state so that he could focus on South Carolina.</span></p> <p><span>Forbes campaigned on a 17 percent flat tax and a socially conservative platform with an anti-abortion stance. After 106 months of economic expansion in which the wealthy have gained more than their share, however, not even the rich could accept in good conscience the free ride that Forbes' tax plan offered them.</span></p> <p><span>Forbes likes to believe that he stimulated the GOP debate on taxes and abortion. But Texas Gov. George W. Bush and McCain would have discussed tax cuts regardless of Forbes, and Forbes may have even brought more attention to abortion than the other candidates would have liked. For instance, Forbes probably pushed Bush to his conservative stance on abortion. In fact, Forbes helped facilitate the GOP's favorite way to lose general elections: force leading candidates to the extreme right during the primaries, so that they alienate the majority of the general election voters and simultaneously win the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Forbes' real contribution to this year's campaign has been to show that lucrative spending cannot develop a constituency. In the Iowa straw poll last August--although no delegates were at stake--Forbes spent $160 per vote. He ranks close to Ross Perot and Michael Huffington among wealthy men willing to spare no expense for their political ambitions.</span></p> <p><span>There has been some debate over who will benefit from Forbes' withdrawal from the race. Bush supporters think that the social conservatives who supported Forbes will come to their side. And McCain's followers hope that Forbes attracted free-minded people who will follow him rather than go along with the party establishment. Unfortunately, this political discussion misses the real winners now that Forbes has terminated his presidential quest and has stopped wasting his money: his children.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Don't Vote McCain For Altar Boy | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As South Carolina's Republican primary comes closer, a strange phenomenon that no one foresaw has dramatically altered the GOP: the rise of Arizona Sen. John S. McCain. New Hampshire conservatives, moderates and independent voters all jumped on the McCain bandwagon. Why? One word: character. And as I sat back listening to pundit after pundit talking about McCain's character I got very confused; were they talking about the John McCain that I knew? It couldn't be.</span></p> <p><span>What a difference a few years make. In the mid-1980s, a group of five \"performers\" attempted to do their best rendition of the Jackson Five's smash hit \"Whatever you got, I want.\" But while the Jackson Five made a cameo on SNL during the seventies, this group, known as the \"Keating Five\" made a cameo in S&amp;L--the savings and loan scandal. Yes, only about 10 years ago John McCain was brought before the Senate Disciplinary Committee for his role in the \"Keating Five\" scandal. McCain accepted about $112,000 from convicted white-collar felon Charles Keating in exchange for assisting in a lobbying effort with federal prosecutors.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, McCain and his wife made at least nine trips on Keating's planes including three Caribbean getaways. Later McCain would reimburse Keating--after facing national humiliation. But he never returned the profit that his family made on their $350,000 dollar investment in a Keating shopping center. This is Mr. I-support-a-massive-campaign-finance-reform-initiative-and-a-government-not-dominated-by-special-interests? Right.</span></p> <p><span>This big trend bucker indeed seems to have a general fondness for big bucks, or at least those possessing big bucks.</span></p> <p><span>Not only did McCain have a longstanding relationship with Keating, he had a big affinity for Bananas. No, he wasn't really a Chiquita guy, he liked other bananas, a man by the name of Joseph \"Joe Bananas\" Bonano who headed the New York crime family bearing his name. McCain liked Joe Bananas so much that he sent him birthday cards, according to the Arizona Daily Star. Sergeant Integrity associating with known mafia types? Something's wrong with that picture.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, he seems to fall a little short in the true love category. He cared about his first wife so much that he had no problem cheating on her (he openly admitted infidelity in his 1999 biography) and ultimately divorcing her after she waited five-and-a-half years for him when he valiantly refused to leave a concentration camp in Vietnam. Instead, he found love where he has made a pattern of finding it and everything else, in wealth; new wife Cindy had a cute smile and, by the way, the bank account of her family's large Budweiser beer distribution company. Cindy, a woman who doesn't exactly look in her couch for spare change when she wants to order pizza, certainly hasn't hurt his bid for the White House. Despite her financial influence, the new marriage meant so much to McCain that he ignored his wife to the point where she became a vicodin and percocet addict. \"Maybe I was wrapped up too much in Washington and my ambitions to pay as much attention as I should have,\" McCain recently admitted on a Dateline NBC interview.</span></p> <p><span>The point of all of this is not to vilify John McCain. But isn't it amazing that this man is America's candidate of integrity? Character? Ridiculous. John McCain has some serious character flaws.</span></p> <p><span>Yet Americans still embrace him. Why? Not because they fail to see all of this information (it isn't buried very deep) but instead because he doesn't \"spin\" it. Ask John McCain about the Keating Five. He'll tell you. And he'll say it was one of the biggest regrets in his entire life. Ask him about his association with the rich and powerful, and he will not deny it. Ask George Bush about photos where he has white stuff on his upper lip, and he'll claim it's a milk mustache.</span></p> <p><span>Americans want to forgive candidates for past wrongs if they face up to them. They have proven this in the past by either picking up or not picking up on the news media's cues. In this case, the media hasn't covered McCain's mistakes all that much because after confronting him on the issues, there is little story that remains. This is the post-Clinton lesson--if you screw up, admit it and move on.</span></p> <p><span>McCain might do an excellent job in the Oval Office if elected. But this has nothing to do with his character. If people vote for him, it should be because he has pledged to pay off the debt and restore fiscal accountability, because he understands military and foreign policy. The character thing has to stop.</span></p> <p><span>The new trend in politics is to admit serious wrongs years later. And while this certainly is better than the Clinton-two-step, it still doesn't erase wrongs. McCain might make a good president, but because his policies work, not because he's some patron saint. Suggesting he's anything other than a typical politician is well, bananas. And I'm not referring to Joe.</span></p> <p><span><i>Brad R. Sohn '02 is a government concentrator in Kirkland House.

{"title": "The Chance for Reform is Now | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The last time I felt this way about a presidential campaign was in 1992. It was my senior year in college, and Clinton was campaigning. For those of you who grew up with President Clinton, it may be hard to imagine that candidate Clinton inspired feelings of promise. The morning after the election, people woke up with a sense of what could be. As cheesy as it sounds, if you dig up the newspapers from that day, you will find many references to this feeling of optimism. Not many people wake up feeling that way about Clinton anymore.</span></p> <p><span>Eight years later, pessimism and apathy were sinking in as both political parties had decided on their favorite sons, and the race seemed half over months before the election. Then came Arizona Sen. John S. McCain's surprise victory in New Hampshire. Most amazingly, this self-styled reformer heralds campaign finance reform as a centerpiece of his platform. In 1992, mentioning campaign finance reform as a real possibility got predictable laughs. Who could amass enough money to win the presidency by biting the hand that feeds them? How would you expect members of Congress to endorse you when you're campaigning to take away the very thing that got them there? And yet campaign finance reform is good for ordinary citizens, and by promoting it McCain--and to a lesser extent Bill Bradley--is bringing the debate to the people.</span></p> <p><span>Why is campaign finance reform so important? One estimate of its importance is in the reaction of its enemies. Many single-issue zealots are campaigning against McCain, a senator who has almost always voted their way. They are rightly afraid that their disproportionate influence on policy will be lost if soft money--a euphemism for unlimited monetary contributions to political parties--is banned. The prospect of true reform is so scary to the establishment that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) stopped blocking Clinton's judicial nominees just to get a strident anti-reformer appointed to the Federal Election Commission, the body that would enforce any new campaign finance laws.</span></p> <p><span>You may agree or disagree with McCain or Bradley on other social or fiscal issues. But campaign finance reform lays the groundwork for all other reforms. Democrat or Republican, a president who won't fight to stop the unlimited flow of soft money--$750 million projected to be spent on this year's election cycle alone--also won't be able to pass common sense reforms that the majority of the country wants. Is it really a coincidence that the only major reforms we have seen in the Clinton presidency addressed immigration and welfare? While welfare recipients and immigrants are not known for their campaign contributions, health care, gun control, education and corporate and military pork all have very well-financed special interest groups with a keen desire to maintain the status quo.</span></p> <p><span>What makes this election exciting is that despite the odds, a politician like McCain has a chance in this country. In Japan, where I emigrated from years ago, politics is decided by the establishment elites in nice restaurants and country clubs. People often just accept what the elites decide because they're too busy with their own lives. A lot of that happens here, too; but every once in a while Americans get off their couch. The people of New Hampshire expected the politicians to come into their town halls and school gymnasiums, answer their questions and listen to their concerns. How many countries require this of candidates for the highest executive office of their land?</span></p> <p><span>All this, and still a recent poll said that more people knew who won the Super Bowl than who won the New Hampshire primary. My mother used to tell me that she was the invisible voter. She would sit out of most elections because the choices were not that different. But when the choices actually mattered, like if Gandhi were running against Hitler, she would vote and have her presence felt. But an invisible voter is really no voter at all. The reason politicians usually don't court the youth vote is because they have a very low turnout. Better to cater to the retirees, the religious conservatives, the unions, who are hard to please but are guaranteed voters. And you wonder why special interests have taken over Washington.</span></p> <p><span>Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice-President Al Gore '69 are not going to reform a system to which they are so indebted. If there ever was a primary season that mattered, this is it. If you don't vote now, you'll find yourself writing an article like this one in 2008, mourning what could have been.</span></p> <p><span><i>Yumio Saneyoshi is an economics tutor in Winthrop House. </i></span></p>"}

{"title": "Making McCain a Contender | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>After Ariz. Sen. John S. McCain's recent victories in Arizona and Michigan, the Republican primary race has regained the status of an actual competition. Long-time frontrunner Tex. Gov. George W. Bush, startled by a drubbing in New Hampshire, won the South Carolina primary after claiming the antithetical mantles of a staunch right-winger and a reformer willing to buck party politics. Although Bush's maneuvers on reform are likely to be exposed as transparent, his move to the right will likely have lasting effects on his campaign, as future primaries will be less influenced by the votes of independents. A primary system that encourages candidates like Bush to appeal to the extremes of their party does a disservice to those candidates with more widely distributed support.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's victory in South Carolina was less than pristine. His campaign there was marked by a number of missteps, most notably his opening speech at Bob Jones University, an institution notorious for its prohibition of interracial dating and for the anti-Catholic sentiments of its founder. Bush's seeming indifference to the institutional racism of his host was only the first indication of his new willingness to go to any lengths to win votes in the state, a willingness further evidenced by his attacks on McCain's voting record on veterans' issues. Running as a born-again Christian, Bush had another conversion in South Carolina, this time to the cause of campaign finance reform; his self-promotion as a \"reformer with results\" was startlingly disingenuous coming from an establishment candidate, especially as his proposed ban on soft money would place few limits on the contributions of wealthy individuals. Bush's website now spouts the phrase \"reformer with results\" so many times that it occasionally forgets to include verbs in its zeal to portray Bush as an outsider: \"Of the major candidates, the only one who does not have a D.C. ZIP code.\" (Perhaps this technique is, in some way, a subtle reflection of the candidate.)</span></p> <p><span>Yet McCain was not immune to the pandering virus. After all, both candidates flubbed the character test posed by the Confederate flag flying over the South Carolina state house, and the charges and countercharges of negative advertising have sullied the reputations of both candidates. However, McCain did emerge from his loss in South Carolina as a candidate who understood the realities of American politics. The religious right is not as strong nationwide as it is in South Carolina, and despite his conservative voting record in the Senate, McCain is the only candidate in the race, on either side, to have sought support from members of both major parties. In the Michigan primary, where McCain won a reasonably narrow victory, more Democrats and independents voted than Republicans.</span></p> <p><span>McCain, however, still has an uphill battle to reach the nomination by courting independents. Michigan was one of the last significant primaries in which the votes of non-party members are counted; had only Republican votes counted toward delegates in Michigan, as will be the case in New York and California on March 7, Bush would have won by a 2-to-1 margin. The primary system tends to push candidates to the extremes, and Bush seems willing to go with the tide. To rebuild his base of support after his New Hampshire loss, Bush made a strong swerve to the right in South Carolina on issues like abortion. Evangelist Pat Robertson stumped for him in the Michigan race. Even McCain is polishing his conservative credentials, emphasizing yesterday that he is a \"proud pro-life conservative Republican.\" It would be very unfortunate if the coming closed primaries allow party regulars to choose among weaker candidates who are willing to pander to the right.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Time for Instant Replay | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I ran into Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin in Bruegger's Bagels the other day. The man in charge of registering the state's voting population was right behind me in the coffee line. If you ever watch the local news in Boston, you will have seen Galvin's commercials--he hides behind a mailbox while a couple discusses their car registration and their child's nursery school registration and pops up to ask whether voter registration isn't just as important.</span></p> <p><span>Galvin is a strong politician and possibly a future gubernatorial candidate, but last week his face lit up at the prospect of an election in which he won't be participating: the presidential primary on March 7. I complimented him on the ads (they're silly but effective) and he responded happily that registration and voter interest were way up this year. I'm glad to hear it, but after South Carolina on Saturday (and despite the McCain comeback in Michigan), I'm concerned that the negative campaigning which won Tex. Gov. George W. Bush the South Carolina primary will dampen the enthusiasm of the electorate as the months wear on, or worse, convince people registering to vote for the wrong person because of misleading ads and dirty tricks</span></p> <p><span>Negative campaigning is inevitable to a certain degree, and it's only fitting that the home state of Lee Atwater (the architect of George Bush's victory over Michael Dukakis in 1988) was the site of some of the worst record-twisting and dirty tactics either party's race has seen this year, but those of us keeping score at home know that South Carolina wasn't the first of the nastiness and it certainly won't be the last. When Bill Bradley was taken to task in the media for \"going negative\" on Vice President Al Gore '69 in New Hampshire, he responded: \"I think I said all along that I was going to run a positive campaign. I have done so for 14 months. And I also said all along you can only take elbows so long and then you have to return them.\"</span></p> <p><span>The basketball metaphor was appropriate for Bradley, the former Knick forward who threw his share of elbows against the Celtics in the '70s, but it also highlighted the biggest problem with negative campaigning: the guy who fights back is the one who gets called for the foul. It is a rhetorical and psychological truth that you cannot be the one to praise your own achievements. Just as true, alas, is the fact that you cannot be the one to protest and/or react to the harm done to you. It happens in basketball all the time--a player puts up with shoves, elbows and the occasional stranglehold until he can't take it anymore and retaliates. Because of what I like to call the Murphy's Law of Blind Referees, the retaliating player gets caught and called for the foul, while the one who instigated the shoving gets the ball back along with a new 24-second clock. I worry that we as voters may be prone to Blind Referee syndrome, forgetting who started the mudslinging first, thereby giving the advantage to the guy with the ball, the money and the longer-running negative commercial.</span></p> <p><span>Basketball doesn't have instant replay, but maybe the media coverage of campaigns should. That way, viewers at home could pause before passing judgment on Ariz. Sen. John S. McCain for calling Bush \"Clintonesque\" and rewind to the New Hampshire debate in which Bush told McCain that he was like Gore. We could watch in slow-motion Gore's sketchy and obviously strategic offer to Bradley on \"Meet the Press\" that the two men dispense with television commercials for the remainder of the campaign or when the Vice President charged in a debate in Iowa that Bradley had voted against disaster relief legislation which Bradley had, in fact, supported.</span></p> <p><span>Though all four of our main presidential contenders have participated in negative campaigning in the last several months (and Tuesday's Democratic debate in Harlem produced disturbing performances from both candidates), Bradley and McCain are in a particularly difficult position: Having cast themselves as reformers and mavericks, they seem as though they ought to be morally above the fray of down-and-dirty campaigning. Thus, when they've found themselves the object of sustained attack and record-twisting, they have been slow to respond and especially vulnerable to the whistle of the referees in the media and the electorate.</span></p> <p><span>Bradley stood stunned in Iowa when Gore misrepresented his record and then went on the attack too late in New Hampshire, gathering more bad press and fewer votes. Now, as he struggles to get back on track in New York, he seems desperate. McCain went negative in his concession speech in South Carolina, and though he was right to attack Bush's self-portrayal as a reformer and a leader, the press deemed the speech too personal and pessimistic, even though comparatively speaking it was a low-key response to the insane amounts of air-time and money Bush (and his \"unofficial\" supporters, including Big Tobacco) devoted to tearing McCain apart.</span></p> <p><span>The negative campaigning probably won't dampen enthusiasm enough by March 7 to lower voter turn-out in Massachusetts and ruin Secretary Galvin's morning bagel. But in the long run, as the March madness of the primaries rolls into the summer and fall of the general election, I hope we won't continue to need an instant replay to see who fouled whom first but rather just be able to keep score on the issues.</span></p> <p><span><i>Susannah B.

{"title": "No Straight Solution | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>By now, Vice President Al Gore '69 and former Sen. Bill Bradley have stopped niggling about just how to enable gay soldiers to serve openly. Tex. Gov. George W. Bush and Ariz. Sen. John S. McCain, their opposition to such a step made clear, have meanwhile shown little desire to rekindle the debate. The quiescence surrounding the issue may be welcome respite in a campaign season that, with every passing day, belies the notion of newfound public civility. But the temporary political truce on homosexuality in the military is a troubled one. The situation on the ground is as volatile as ever.</span></p> <p><span>Members of the Army are already undergoing a 90-day education program aimed at rooting out homophobic harassment. Each of the armed services is slated to draw up and conduct similar training. Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen deemed the sensitivity sessions necessary last July, when a soldier clubbed Private Barry Winchell to death in Fort Campbell, Ky., after extensively baiting Winchell about his homosexuality. It was not until Feb. 1, however, that Cohen explicitly instructed everyone in the armed services to undergo the training. Cohen has also requested a detailed report to gauge animus against gays in the military from the Department of Defense's inspector general.</span></p> <p><span>These most recent efforts bring the country face-to-face, yet again, with the fundamental question of whether gays should be allowed to serve openly in the armed forces. The blitzkrieg of moral and military dilemmas unleashed by the debate is daunting and asking difficult questions is therefore essential. Equality is a noble goal, but how far should it extend? Unit cohesion is desirable, but is it ever moderated by other considerations? Unfortunately, neither the left nor the right has cared to ask.</span></p> <p><span>Liberals are big on rights. The 14th Amendment, according to the standard argument, extends to all citizens the equal protection of the laws. This guarantee must be upheld, especially when so basic a civic capacity as defending one's country is at stake. Discrimination on the basis of lifestyle is a clear-cut violation of individual dignity and self-determination, and as such cannot be countenanced. Conservatives take issue with such claims, objecting usually on the basis of unit cohesion. Rights, so the reasoning goes, are meaningful only insofar as a state can stay independent enough to secure them. Fighting power is the overriding imperative. Openly gay soldiers might impair the unit cohesion integral to an effective army, and for this reason alone they should not serve.</span></p> <p><span>There is some merit to both perspectives. Obviously, the military should not be a testing ground for theories of social justice. When it comes to war and peace, we do not have the luxury of running controls or tweaking variables ad infinitum; if the experiment fails, men and women die. In this regard, the callous disregard for national security evinced by those who spout entitlement talk is contemptible. At the same time, the exclusive emphasis of many conservatives on unit cohesion and effectiveness is more than slightly disquieting. Developed to its logical extreme, it can lead to--indeed has led to--truly totalitarian lengths.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout World War II both the Nazi and Soviet armies achieved significant unit cohesion. Admittedly, there was nothing fuzzy or friendly about the means employed. Stalin had gunners open fire on deserters. The SS brutalized inhabitants of areas through which the Wehrmacht passed, leaving no doubt in the German soldiers' mind that local capture was not a viable option. German troops were also informed that desertion would result in retribution against their families. The moral repugnance of such techniques notwithstanding, they almost certainly contributed to tangible differences in military performance per capita. For every enemy soldier the American trooper killed, his German counterpart killed 1.5.</span></p> <p><span>Yet the point is efficiency is not and cannot be the only goal of the American army. We do not shoot soldiers deserting on the battlefield, and we most certainly do not go after their families. An imperfect record notwithstanding, we respect human rights. And we attach value to the individual life. Although we might have a better military if we lost our national conscience, we properly insist that fighting power take a backseat to certain fundamental, defining values of our country.</span></p> <p><span>This is not to imply that the values of society at large map neatly onto those of the armed services. Just try telling your drill sergeant you intend to uphold Jeffersonian principles of individualism throughout Hell Week. There is a tension here--a mutual tugging at the boundaries between civil right and military imperative. But the latter is definitely constrained by the former.</span></p> <p><span>This, then, is the appropriate framework within which the issue of open homosexuality in the military should be addressed. It is not merely a binary question of upholding equality on the one hand or maintaining military effectiveness on the other.</span></p> <p><span>Rather, does or should equality in America extend the same degree of moral recognition to gay and straight lifestyles? And even if it does, is the right to sexual self-determination so fundamental that a presumption is made in its favor even when no one is 100 percent sure what the long-term impact on national defense will be?</span></p> <p><span>Surveying the policy landscape through such a scope might finally help us move beyond the Don't Ask, Don't Tell, (and now Don't Harass) muddle. With it in place, the new batch of military  anti-harassment programs should have a better chance of operating at maximum success.</span></p> <p><span><i>Boleslaw Z.

He thought it was going in, as did the 2,125 fans at Lavietes Pavilion who gathered to watch the Harvard men's basketball team play its final home game of the season.</span></p> <p><span>But when Clemente's turn-around three-point shot with 1.9 seconds left glanced off the rim, a crazy back-and-forth game ended with Penn escaping with a 62-61 victory.</span></p> <p><span>The miss was a disappointing end to an otherwise exciting weekend, which saw the Crimson first get blown off the court 63-48 by Princeton Friday night and then return to scare the NCAA-tournament bound Quakers on Saturday.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Penn 62, Harvard 61 </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Harvard (10-15, 5-7 Ivy) had kept the game close the entire way and overcame a 10-point deficit in the second half to pull within three with just under 30 seconds remaining to set up the final sequence.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Captain Damian Long, playing in his final home game, hit both ends of the one-and-one to get the Crimson to the final one-point deficit. Harvard then tried to steal the ball, but when the Quakers crosses half-court, it tried to foul any player.</span></p> <p><span>Penn (18-7, 11-0), however, played keep away, shaving valuable seconds off the game clock. Star Penn guard Michael Jordan got the ball, jumped up looking for someone to pass to, but came down without getting rid of the ball and was called for the travel. Harvard remained alive for the last shot with 9.3 seconds left.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson inbounded the ball to freshman guard Elliott Prasse-Freeman, who worked the ball up the court before finding Clemente in the corner. Jordan, however, switched off a screen and was able to get a piece of the ball-- knocking it out of bounds and forcing the final shot with 1.9 seconds left.</span></p> <p><span>Clemente mouthed \"Give me the ball\" and his teammates obliged. While the shot looked clean, it just went a little too long.</span></p> <p><span>\"The plan was to get the ball to Dan coming off two or three screens,\" Harvard Coach Frank Sullivan said. \"The whole game it had worked, and we thought Dan would take the shot over Jordan. Any other player couldn't have [tipped the ball] other than Jordan.\"</span></p> <p><span>While the final shot may have looked unorthodox, Clemente had no problem with it.</span></p> <p><span>\"I like that shot--it's one of my favorites,\" Clemente said. \"When it left my hand, I thought it was all right.\"</span></p> <p><span>From the start it looked like Harvard was going to get blown out again. The Quakers jumped out to a 18-5 lead on transition baskets and fast breaks. Harvard shot itself in the foot by constantly missing short lay-ups and jumpers. More often than not, the Crimson got stifled by 6'11 center Geoff Owens, who scared the Crimson into redirecting shots and changing their minds about driving into the lane.</span></p> <p><span>Both teams shot poorly, but Harvard went into the locker room only down 30-24 due to the play of Clemente and Prasse-Freeman. Clemente finished the half with 12 points while Prasse-Freeman had seven assists.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard came out strong defensively in the second half and actually took a brief 35-34 lead on Clemente's layup off a Penn turnover. Jordan then scored five straight points and gave the Quakers a lead it would never relinquish.</span></p> <p><span>Luckily for Harvard, it would be Jordan's final five points.</span></p> <p><span>Clemente continued to terrorize Quaker forward Ugonna Onyekwe in the low post and scored almost at will. Meanwhile, Harvard sophomore guard Drew Gellert took on an unusual role as an offensive threat, getting inside for easy layups.</span></p> <p><span>Gellert finished with ten points.</span></p> <p><span>Though Jordan wasn't scoring, three other Penn players went for double figures. Guard Matt Langel hit three 3-pointers in the latter part of the second half to help Penn open up a 10-point lead, and Owens had a double-double with 12 points and 17 rebounds.</span></p> <p><span>The Quakers, however, kept stumbling as it tried to pull away. Nine turnovers in the second half, combined with poor free-throw shooting let Harvard keep the game close. Clemente became a one-man show in the last five minutes to get Harvard to within those final three points.</span></p> <p><span>\"This time we took good shots from them and didn't back down,\" said Sullivan, making a reference to the game in Philadelphia, when Penn easily won 79-52.</span></p> <p><span>In that game, Clemente had two points and fouled out. Saturday night, he went for 25 points in 37 minutes.</span></p> <p><span>\"I felt the rhythm,\" Clemente said. \"I was posting up really well [against Onyekwe] and got my turnaround going in.\"</span></p> <p><span>Prasse-Freeman also played outstanding despite poor shooting numbers, gathering 14 assists and only one turnover, which was a traveling violation in the second half.</span></p> <p><span>\"Elliott played with a great assist-turnover ratio,\" said Sullivan. \"He didn't let Friday night [against Princeton] get to him.\"</span></p> <p><span>The final home game of the season marked the final home games for Long and 12th man Ethan Altaratz. Altaratz got to start and didn't waste the opportunity, getting two points and a block in eight minutes of play.</span></p> <p><span>Long finished out a great home season that saw him become the premier long-range shooter for the Crimson. Epitomizing the definition of captain, Long rallied his troops in the tense final minutes and made sure they didn't lose their poise as they had against Princeton.</span></p> <p><span>Despite his best efforts, Long was unable to get anything going offensively all night with Jordan guarding him. He went 3-of-11 from the floor, including 1-of-6 from three-point range. His 3-pointer, however, tied him for the Harvard record for consecutive games with a 3-pointer at 23.</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't know anybody who plays with more heart than Damian Long,\" Clemente said. \"He deserved to win it.\"</span></p> <p><span>For the second year in a row, Penn left Lavietes Pavilion thanking the good Lord for a miraculous win. Even though the Quakers are a much improved team from last year and destined for the NCAA tournament, Harvard doesn't care that it gave Penn its toughest Ivy win.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's not a moral victory,\" Clemente said. \"We don't take moral victories.\"</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Princeton 63, Harvard 48 </b><p> </p><p></p></font>On Friday night, presidential politics made its way into the men's basketball game against Princeton.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Seven scantily clad gentlemen with \"BRADLEY\" painted across their chests served to remind the audience that this game was not only between the two basketball teams, but also symbolically between Princeton alum Bill Bradley and Harvard alum Al Gore '69.</span></p> <p><span>Breaking with the trend of the national political contest, the Tigers (16-9, 8-2 Ivy) vetoed the Crimson (10-14, 5-6) by winning 63-48 at the sold-out Lavietes Pavilion.</span></p> <p><span>Coming off a two-game sweep of Yale and Brown, Harvard was halted in its Ivy League progress by an anemic offense and inconsistent defense.</span></p> <p><span>The Crimson, who shot only 34.8 percent from the field and 56.3 percent from the line for the night, never led in the game and struggled to find its rhythm all night.</span></p> <p><span>While Harvard missed its first three shots from the field, Princeton rattled off three consecutive 3-pointers and a free throw for a quick 10-0 lead.</span></p> <p><span>The fast Tiger scoring caught the Crimson off-guard, and created a large deficit that lasted most of the night.</span></p> <p><span>\"Two crucial elements to playing Princeton are not giving up early points and not getting down by too much,\" Sullivan said, \"Unfortunately, we couldn't get those things done.\"</span></p> <p><span>Harvard was also plagued by errant passes and had ten turnovers to Princeton's five in the first half.</span></p> <p><span>Prasse-Freeman, who is 12th in the nation in assists per game, struggled with a six to seven assist-to-turnover ratio.</span></p> <p><span>\"Accurate passes and finding good scoring opportunities are essential to establishing our flow through the game,\" Prasse-Freeman said.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard's \"flow\" was further interrupted by timely Princeton offensive rebounds.</span></p> <p><span>During one sequence early in the first half, the Tigers offensive rebounding allowed them to keep possession for nearly two minutes.</span></p> <p><span>\"Against Princeton, you have to get defensive rebounds or else their slow tempo will make you pay,\" Sullivan said.</span></p> <p><span>At the end of the first half, the Crimson was visibly sluggish as it made its way to the locker rooms, down 26-17.</span></p> <p><span>The second half began with eerie similarity to the first half as Princeton capitalized on Harvard misses to make two 3-pointers and a free throw, pushing the lead to 33-17.</span></p> <p><span>Although the Tigers extended their lead to as many as 20 points, the Crimson, led by the gritty Long, valiantly clawed its way back to within nine with four minutes to play.</span></p> <p><span>\"We always work hard for each other,\" Long said, \"No matter who's wearing the black [away] jerseys, we always leave it all out on the court.\"</span></p> <p><span>The comeback fell short though, as Princeton guard Ahmed El-Nokali victimized the Harvard defense for seven points in the final five minutes.</span></p> <p><span>Although Princeton eventually won 63-48, Harvard had a flash of brilliance in defeat.</span></p> <p><span>Gellert broke the single-season steals record previously held by Mike Gielen '89 and Keith Webster '87.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's nice to break the record, but it didn't help us win tonight.

He also won handily in his home state of Arizona.</span></p> <p><span>With majority of the precincts reporting in Michigan, McCain led Bush, 50 percent to 44 percent. Former ambassador Alan L. Keyes '72 registered 5 percent in the state.</span></p> <p><span>A little startled by the defeat, Bush, who was campaigning in Missouri, said, \"This is a marathon, and I'm going to be in it all the way to the end--and some primaries you win and sometimes you don't.\"</span></p> <p><span>But pollster John Zogby, who has proved his credibility to the campaigns by his accurate tracking polls, said McCain's victory proves the senator can create enthusiasm among voters in a populous, diverse state.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's a whole new ballgame,\" Zogby said.</span></p> <p><span>McCain can thank a huge turnout in the state--more than 1,000,000 voters--for his victory.</span></p> <p><span>Exit polls show that nearly 51 percent of primary voters were either Democrats or Independents. Eighty-two percent of those voters chose McCain.</span></p> <p><span>Bush gained the vote of a large majority of the state's Republican voters, but since Republicans comprised only a plurality of voters in the primary, Bush did not have enough support to win.</span></p> <p><span>Even before the polls closed last night, Engler and other prominent Bush supporters sought to downplay McCain's win.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is the first time in American politics that we've had a Republican candidate seeking hard-core Democrats to come into our primary,\" he told reporters.</span></p> <p><span>Bush charged that non-Republicans had stolen the primary for McCain.</span></p> <p><span>No matter where his support came from, McCain conceded yesterday that his campaign was in a must-win situation.</span></p> <p><span>\"Every day is do or die,\" he said while voting his home state of Arizona. \"We're a high-wire act and an insurgency campaign.\"</span></p> <p><span>His supporters hoped to profit from his victories.</span></p> <p><span>\"[Last night's wins] will reinvigorate the troops. Some people were feeling a little down...but this will help to bring focus back to the race,\" said Mattie J. Germer '03, the Harvard coordinator for McCain.</span></p> <p><span>Exit polls showed Bush winning votes from people who cared most about abortion, moral values and taxes, while McCain won more from those concerned about international relations, campaign finance reform and federal entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare.</span></p> <p><span>In Michigan, McCain stressed his plan to devote a majority of the projected federal budget surplus to shoring up the Social Security trust fund. This played well among the state's blue-collar workers, exit polls showed.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Votes Equal Cash </b><p> </p></font>Now just two weeks from March 7's Super Tuesday primary, when delegates from large states like California, Ohio, New York and Massachusetts are at stake, McCain will not be able to rely on such narrowly tailored messages, his supporters said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>And since most of the Super Tuesday primaries are limited to party voters only--New Hampshire, Michigan and South Carolina were open to registered voters in all parties--McCain's supporters said they expect he will focus on promoting his conservative credentials.</span></p> <p><span>With Bush's financial resources strained from his bruising loss in New Hampshire and television-heavy campaigning in South Carolina, McCain's campaign machinery plans to spend at least as much as Bush in the next two weeks.</span></p> <p><span>\"We're not going to be outspent 10 to 1[by Bush] like we have been, especially if he keeps spending like he has been,\" Germer said.</span></p> <p><span>Bush, who spent more than $3 million in one week alone last month, has had to reinvigorate his own fundraising apparatus in order to keep pace.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>A Look Ahead </b><p> </p></font>The next 14 days will see 16 primaries and caucuses, and all the campaigns agree the race for the party nominations will likely be decided by the end of the Super Tuesday primaries on March 7.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>Beginning today, the candidates will turn their attention to Washington State, which will hold its primary Feb. 29.</span></p> <p><span>\"It will be interesting to see what happens in Washington state,\" said Luke P. McLoughlin '00, the Harvard coordinator for Bradley. \"A victory can give [Bradley] momentum into the March 7 primaries.\"</span></p> <p><span>Democrats are already focused on the Northeast, where five New England states, including Massachusetts, will join New York on Super Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Northeast should be pretty fertile ground for McCain,\" Zogby said.</span></p> <p><span>His platform of campaign finance reform should appeal to the traditionally liberal Northeast voters, Zogby said.</span></p> <p><span>McCain has tried unsuccessfully for four straight years to get the Senate to adopt stricter fund-raising controls, including a ban on the unregulated donations to parties known as \"soft money.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bush, the first presidential candidate ever to raise more than $50 million, would ban soft money contributions from corporations and unions, but not from other groups. He would also raise the limit on individual contributions.</span></p> <p><span>Bush has refused federal matching money for his campaign, freeing him to spend as much as he wants.</span></p> <p><span>But many voters will be concentrating on making sure the economy continues to grow, predicts Martin A. Linsky, a lecturer at the Kennedy School of Government.</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't think voters in the Northeast are unique,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>\"Their central concerns are keeping the economy humming along, and making sure the growth extends throughout the community,\" he added.</span></p> <p><span>Both McCain and Bush have proposed tax cuts, though the Texas Governor's reductions are more generous.</span></p> <p><span>The Democratic race is not as simple to characterize, particularly in the Northeast.</span></p> <p><span>Massachusetts, one of the most solidly Democratic states in the nation, will likely go for Al Gore '69--whom Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54-56 has endorsed--and McCain, Zogby predicts.</span></p> <p><span>\"In the Massachusetts GOP primary voters will look more like voters in Michigan than like voters in South Carolina, because of the differences in ideology,\" Linsky said.</span></p> <p><span>Both Gore and former senator Bill Bradley support a soft money ban and full federal financing of elections. Both advocate spending increases for child care programs, though Bradley proposes targeted tax credits for child care expenses.</span></p> <p><span>The two Democrats differ only slightly on defense policy, though only Gore supports what he calls \"sensible\" increases in the military's budget.</span></p> <p><span>In the other New England states, Maine, Vermont Rhode Island and Connecticut, anything is possible, Zogby said. All four have very independent streaks in politics and are ruled by \"Yankee conservatism,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Both Bradley and McCain might benefit from New York's history of voting for the underdog candidate, Zogby predicts.</span></p> <p><span>\"Democrats in New York  love to turn the world upside-down,\" he said. \"It's hard to predict, but history is on [Bradley's] side.\"</span></p> <p><span>Besides, Bradley is from New Jersey and played for the New York Knicks, Zogby added.</span></p> <p><span>\"Bradley has to do well, but it's a place where he has a footing,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>A \"ham-handed\" effort by Bush supporters to keep McCain off the ballot has backfired in New York, Zogby said.</span></p> <p><span>\"Not only was there bad press, but it really angered some rank-and-file Republicans,\" he said. \"[McCain] could do well.\"</span></p> <p><span>Candidates campaigning in New York need to remember that only about 15 percent of the primary vote comes from New York City, Zogby added.</span></p> <p><span>\"New York is not as daunting as one might think,\" he said. \"Right now, there's a slight advantage to Bush.

{"title": "Anyone Can Be President Online | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>On Feb. 14, Bill Clinton became the first President to participate in a live public Internet chat. Of course, he was helped in reaching that goal by the fact that prior to 1992, the Internet didn't exist as a mass medium. But that's no reason to deny Clinton the glory of being the \"first.\" Organized by CNN and moderated by correspondent Wolf Blitzer, the chat was intended to be an opportunity for citizens to interact with the President more directly than was possible before the Internet. Unfortunately, not even Clinton was immune to the biggest problem of Internet chats--that people are not always what they seem.</span></p> <p><span>The chat started quite uneventfully; as is to be expected, the questions were moderated and were mostly softballs. The problem, however, came when the heavy load of users trying to ask questions crashed the Internet relay chat server and forced CNN to restart it.</span></p> <p><span>Surprisingly, the server had not been set up to reserve any usernames, such as President_Clinton or Wolf_Blitzer, to specific computers. Anyone could take those names, without even a password, as long as no one else had them first. Since Clinton and Blitzer had been logged in from the beginning, this did not seem to be a problem--until one clever user wondered what would happen if the server crashed.</span></p> <p><span>Christopher Petro, who works at an Internet startup in Manhattan and had been participating in the chat under the username of \"wankel,\" decided to put this possibility to the test. As soon as the server had restarted after a crash, he tried switching his username to \"President_Clinton.\" Since Clinton (or, rather, the person typing for the President) hadn't logged on yet, it worked, and for a few fleeting instants Petro had the bully pulpit all to himself.</span></p> <p><span>President_Clinton then told the chat room, \"Personally, I'd like to see more porn on the Internet.\" When Blitzer reconnected a few seconds later, President_Clinton asked him, \"Wolf, how about you? Are you all for more porn on the Internet?\"</span></p> <p><span>After thirty seconds, during which Petro says he \"found himself in respiratory distress due to excessive laughter,\" someone at CNN decided that this was probably not the President talking and banned President_Clinton from the chat. However, Petro reconnected faster than the real President Clinton could and told the chat room, \"okay, that was just too much. my apologies\" before he was banned permanently. One wonders how long Petro could have lasted if he had decided to discuss a more realistic topic, such as China policy or the 2000 elections. Perhaps he would have finished the rest of the chat, and sent the news media home with some new revelations (\"'George W. Bush a Weenie,' Clinton Says in Internet Chat\").</span></p> <p><span>Coming as it did after a week of distributed denial-of-service attacks against major commercial websites, the prank was reported as yet another example of the dangers of the electronic age. The original story on Foxnews.com described the attack as \"the latest in a recent wave of cyber-vandalism that has already targeted cnn.com,\" and the New York Daily News said Clinton's chat had been \"victimized by a cyberattack.\"</span></p> <p><span>CNN scrambled to announce that its computer systems had not been \"hacked\" and  that no one had taken control of them; the problem was simply that CNN failed to set up the chat correctly. The episode seems to be a reminder that computer systems are just as vulnerable to silly human error as to malicious \"hackers.\" Just paying adequate attention could have saved the network a good deal of embarrassment.</span></p> <p><span>The morning after the chat, Clinton met with various dignitaries (including a security expert by the screen name of \"Mudge\") to discuss ways to improve security on the Internet. The meeting had been planned earlier, but one wonders what impressions he brought away from the first live Presidential online chat the night before.</span></p>"}

Babcock</span></p> <p><span>Feb 10-20</span></p> <p><span>Boston Ballet</span></p> <p><span>Schubert Theater</span></p> <p><span>By DIANA MOVIUS</span></p> <p><span>CONTRIBUTING WRITER</span></p> <p><span>Imagine all the guests at your wedding dropping their wine glasses--in unison. While that may not happen in real life, it can happen at the Boston Ballet, in one of three pieces presented in their performance Without Words at the Shubert Theater last week.</span></p> <p><span>The title piece, Nacho Duato's Without Words is a strikingly contemporary work. Dancing off-pointe, in soft shoes, performers wear a tight-fitting, flesh-colored suits, giving the impression of being nude. To put it lightly, as dance critic Anna Kisselgoff said, \"Duato has a gift for the startling image.\" The choreography is equally as startling. It consists of busy, fast-paced steps, completely departing from even neo-classical ballet in both movement and atmosphere. Duato's choreography is difficult and tricky, and Boston Ballets dancers executed it with athleticism, clarity and polish.</span></p> <p><span>Though clich for dance, the title Without Words is extremely appropriate. Every aspect of the piece creates an unsettling dichotomy between the movement and the other aspects of the piece. The frantic, often jarring movements directly contrasted with the calm harmony of the music, a Shubert composition for the piano and cello. Meanwhile, extremely large photographs of the dancers' movements are projected onto a large screen through which dancers enter and exit. The net result was a definite sense of silence. Visual sensory overload (the fluid movement and frequently-changing photography) combined with soothing, lullaby-esque Shubert music to underline the absence of words.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, this contrast grew tiresome. For the most part, Without Words made me long for words, or at least some explanatory material and emotional impact. I was constantly impressed with the skill of the dancers and the creative moves of the dance, but also felt myself wondering what the choreographer was trying to say and whether an underlying theme even existed. Honestly, I expected more substance from a piece that obtained rave reviews in 1998 from its New York premier. Despite the creative choreography and amazing dancers, it is simply hard to sustain an interest in a piece based solely on an appreciation for movement.</span></p> <p><span>The piece that followed Without Words, however, had more than enough emotional impact. Mark Godden's Another Year, set to tense music by Henryk Gorecki, dramatizes the disintegration of a marriage. The piece, not surprisingly, opens with a marriage: a couple embraces while the guests hold up wine glasses in a toast. Suddenly, the music clashes and all the guests let go of their cups, which (because they are tied to the ceiling by invisible wire) then swing in unison for the remainder of the ballet. This stark, surprising introduction immediately drew me into the piece. The ever-present wine glasses represent the promises and happiness of the wedding;  they hang from the ceiling to show a direct opposition to the unhappy events that ensue. The bride has an affair and ultimately is forced to choose between her lover and her husband. At one extremely moving part of the dance, three other unhappy couples reach toward the ceiling toward the cups, as if wondering where the promises went.</span></p> <p><span>The end is just as startling and symbolic as the beginning, and also makes use of wine glass imagery. The wine glasses lower from the ceiling, and the guests drop them once more, as if forever abandoning the notion of a happy marriage, leaving the bride, her husband and her lover in the center of the stage. Overall, the piece has lots of impact and emotional appeal--the viewer can't help but wonder what is haunting the characters and why their relationships aren't working out.</span></p> <p><span>The last piece, Paul Taylor's Company B, surpasses both the others in interest, impact and emotion. A tribute to wartime America, Taylor uses memorable songs sung by the Andrews Sisters and ingenious choreography to place the audience in the midst of history and delve into wartime issues. From \"I Can Dream, Cant I?\" (a song about a woman whose love is overseas) to the \"Pennsylvania Polka,\" Taylor's work explores many of the human faces and emotions of war. Overall, Company B gave a very real, human, touching experience of wartime life.</span></p>"}

But hyperactive cartoon figures and charismatic presidential candidates aside, this has undeniably been the year of Regis Philbin.</span></p> <p><span>Since the middle of last summer, the nation has declared Philbin the king of prime-time television with his reign over ABC's \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" And as of Tuesday morning, when Philbin's 15-year co-host Kathy Lee Gifford announced she plans to leave their show \"Live With Regis and Kathy Lee\" this summer, Regis gets a morning talk show all to himself as well.</span></p> <p><span>Well, not really. Regis is likely to get another co-host, but we at Dartboard love to muse on the idea of a Regis-only morning show. Things have been looking just as good for Philbin as they have been for those lucky contestants who get into the \"Millionaire\" hot seat. In fact, the television show \"Everyone Loves Raymond\" should permanently change its name to \"Everyone Loves Regis\"--the nation just can't get enough of the guy.

This phenomenon becomes even more peculiar when one considers that the citizens of these territories pay no federal taxes and cannot even vote in the general election.</span></p> <p><span>Puerto Rico held the largest clout of this mini \"super weekend,\" with the prize of 14 delegates. Former Gov. Luis Ferre, a close friend of George W.'s father, leads Puerto Rico's Republicans and enthusiastically endorsed Bush. Fortunately for W., Ferre proved much more dependable than Michigan Gov. John Engler at turning the vote out for the Republican Party's anointed--if still challenged--one. Engler had guaranteed victory for Bush in Michigan before McCain's stunning upset.</span></p> <p><span>Puerto Rico gave Bush an incredible landslide victory of 94 percent of the vote as he went on to sweep the territories. The lack of media coverage, or of campaigning by the candidates, for that matter, is in fact sort of sad; one can only think now of the reporters, mai tai's in hand, kicking back on the beaches of the South Pacific, or trying out their credit limits on a quick trip to the Caribbean commonwealth, perhaps writing the whole experience off as a business expense. Plus, it would be a chance to see how flexible and fast on their feet the candidates really are--wouldn't it be great to have a president who could speak about the local politics of Agana, Pago Pago and Charlotte Amalie (those are the capitals of Guam, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands, for the talk-show hosts and campaign staffers in the audience).</span></p> <p><span>Then again, maybe not. Since when do American territories exert influence in Presidential nominations? If we rebelled against England in 1776 for taxation without representation, since when do we offer representation without taxation? You are telling us that these people live in their various paradises without even the speed bump of federal taxes? Sign us up. At least we can comfort ourselves that they don't get any say in the fall, when it matters--what will they, sitting on their beaches, say then?</span></p> <p><span>One final thought is that all these folk, for whatever reason of territorial logic, supported Bush for President. If these territories insist on supporting George W., then they at least would have to deal with him being their Commander-in-Chief.</span></p> <p><span>--Benjamin M. Grossman</span></p>"}
{"title": "Discarding the Religious Right | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The political ramifications of Ariz. Sen. John S. McCain's courageous condemnation of the religious right's \"self-appointed leaders\" last Monday in Virginia are still unclear. As was to be expected, Texas Gov. George W. Bush enjoyed the support of Virginia's rank-and-file Republicans and religious conservatives to win all of the state's 56 delegates. But the true test of McCain's move to the middle will be next week's \"Super Tuesday\" primaries, when 13 states and 613 GOP delegates will be up for grabs. Granted, McCain's remarks may have alienated conservative Republican voters on whom he must now rely even more, since the bulk of the upcoming primaries will be restricted to registered party members. Nevertheless, in states like New York, both GOP candidates could benefit politically by distancing themselves from the religious far right. Even Bush, in the wake of critical attacks regarding his appearance at Bob Jones University, recently wrote an apologetic letter to Cardinal John O'Connor, the leader of New York's Catholics.</span></p> <p><span>This is not to say that McCain's indictment of Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition, and Rev. Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral Majority, was nothing more than political maneuvering. On the contrary, the remarks last Monday in Virginia may be indicative of a deeper, and potentially far-reaching, re-examination of the GOP's soul. For the first time since the Reagan campaign, the Republican party might find reason to shift its base.</span></p> <p><span>According to Ralph Reed, one of Gov. Bush's advisors and a former executive director of the Christian Coalition, Bush's strategy has been to \"follow the classic Reagan model. Begin with core conservative voters. Move from there to rank-and-file Republicans. Then move to independents. Then move out to conservative Democrats.\" McCain has turned this approach on its head. His victories in New Hampshire and Michigan have been bolstered by the support of moderate Republicans, independents and Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>McCain has repeatedly shown a willingness to discard the support of the far-right evangelical leaders drawn in by the Reagan era, from last year's meeting with Log Cabin Republicans to this week's sharp censure of Robertson and Falwell.</span></p> <p><span>This appeal to what is perceived as \"party outsiders\" has led Bush to accuse McCain of trying to divide the Republican party. Nothing could be farther from the truth. McCain's strong showing thus far should indicate to party leaders that voters aren't so willing to embrace the old establishment. Any type of party re-examination, particularly one as cathartic as this, is a sign of a healthy primary season.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Vote Bradley, McCain in Mass. | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Massachusetts voters heading to the polls tomorrow to participate in their party's primaries will be partaking in a decisive stage of the presidential election. Dubbed \"Super Tuesday,\" voting in 16 states will determine nearly a third of the delegates who are sent to the Republican and Democratic conventions. Although much of the attention will be focused on New York and California, Massachusetts is widely regarded as a crucial New England state. In this light, we take this opportunity to reaffirm our endorsement of former Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic party and Arizona Sen. John S. McCain on the Republican side.</span></p> <p><span>It would be unrealistic to ignore that Bradley's campaign has slowed considerably since his strong showing in New Hampshire last month. A resounding loss in Washington State, where he spent six straight days of campaigning, has lead many to discount Bradley as a serious contender for his party's nomination. What is unfortunate, however, is that Bradley's decline in the polls stems more from a shift in public image rather than his stance on substantive policy issues. Bradley's unhurried and deliberate debating style--once characterized by pundits as a cerebral, \"Olympian\" calm--is now seen as a lack of enthusiasm for the presidential post. After his ill-timed responses to criticisms by his opponent, Vice President Al Gore '69, Bradley has been beleaguered by the \"going negative\" label.</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, Bradley's stances on important policy positions remain sound. Bradley's ambitious health care plan addresses the very real and pressing problem experienced by the one-sixth of the American population who have no health insurance. His $65 million plan would ensure near-universal and affordable coverage. Although Bradley has yet to address specific funding issues, he is the only presidential candidate firmly committed to the plausible ideal of universal health coverage. Beyond health care, Bradley has not wavered from his promise of campaign finance reform and has had a relatively clean record when it comes to fundraising. In education, he has vowed to forgive loans for students who earn teaching certification and plan to work in poor schools. This is a promising way of addressing the current teacher shortage and indicates that Bradley is in tune with the single greatest crisis facing American public education.</span></p> <p><span>On the Republican side, we urge voters to cast their ballot for McCain. McCain's straight-talking, brash style has earned him the affection of the media, much to the chagrin of his party's establishment. But more importantly, McCain has given the GOP a rare opportunity to reevaluate its current party base. He has courageously condemned the leaders of the religious right and their pernicious influence, particularly in the form of religious litmus tests. Although we are far from comfortable with many McCain's socially conservative positions--such as his stances on abortion and gun control--McCain's commitment to campaign finance reform and willingness to depart from party leadership throws a certain weight behind his self-proclaimed status as a reformer.</span></p> <p><span>To win their party's nomination, both Bradley and McCain will have to climb an uphill road. Bradley faces the challenge of reinvigorating a campaign that some have dismissed altogether. McCain must find a way to attract more support from within his party, since many of the upcoming primaries are open only to registered Republicans. But we urge Bradley and McCain supporters, particularly those who are tempted to believe that the primary race is all but over, to cast their vote tomorrow. The chance to participate in a primary election as competitive and as healthy as this one should not be foregone.</span></p>"}

{"title": "McCain's Moral Equivalent of War | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Supporters of Arizona Sen. John S. McCain had a tough time last night at the IOP. As returns from the Super Tuesday primaries flashed on screen, McCainiacs felt less than super. By all accounts the McCain enthusiasts at the IOP were the most spirited of the lot, although the real zealots were elsewhere, hobnobbing at the campaigns' election night parties.</span></p> <p><span>On a Tuesday night on the cusp of midterm season, the IOP was full. Despite widespread reports of disillusionment with politics, it's not unusual for college students to become involved in presidential campaigns with a youthful passion that brings others' apathy into striking relief. In the crowds at election night parties, one finds rosy-cheeked co-eds and would-be politicos cheering for candidates who could not possibly merit such unflagging devotion. And the most curious thing of all: whether election night means concession or celebration, indeed whether their candidate is a winner or a bumbler, a reliable crowd of rowdy students is always there.</span></p> <p><span>But there is something different about McCain's student supporters. Their cheeks are rosier, their cheering louder, their rowdiness rowdier. And it's not obvious why this is so. Gore and Bradley promise the most money for higher education, Bush is the youngest and (arguably) most charming, and Alan Keyes is, well, Alan Keyes. McCain, meanwhile, is a stodgy veteran who, like Grandpa at the fireplace, never stops talking about \"when I was your age\u2026\"</span></p> <p><span>In a recent article in The Weekly Standard, David Brooks offered an explanation for McCain's odd rapport with the young. McCain is the anti-boomer, wrote Brooks: He appeals directly to the elderly (\"The Greatest Generation\") and to their grandchildren, but cares not so much for everyone in between. McCain favors self-sacrifice to immediate gratification, frugality to indulgence, prudence to pleasure. Self-gratifying boomers are personae non gratis.</span></p> <p><span>Part of McCain's appeal to college students, then, has to do with his gentle contempt for their parents: his rhetoric is, in part, meant to cause something of a Thermidorian Reaction against the ever-indulgent boomers. Rebelling against rebellion is a difficult trick, but with a clever slight of hand a skilled leader can rouse the rabble under the flag of prudence.</span></p> <p><span>And much of McCain's rhetoric is addressed directly to the young. When announcing his candidacy, he declared, \"I run for President because I want the next generation of Americans to know the sense of pride and purpose of serving a cause greater than themselves.\" And, in a graduation speech at Johns Hopkins University: \"I wish for you the discovery that while the pleasures and vanities of youth prove ephemeral, something better can endure until our last moment on earth. And that is the love we give and the honor we earn when we sacrifice with others for a cause greater than our self-interest.\"</span></p> <p><span>McCain often speaks of prudence (for instance, when he talks about social security and taxes), but the hallmark of his \"New Patriotic Challenge\" is not so much prudence as heroism--the willingness to sacrifice, to suffer pain, even to die, for a worthy cause. Heroism is most closely associated with war, and references to war run throughout McCain's rhetoric--not only with regard to himself and \"The Greatest Generation,\" but to faith, party politics and most everything else.</span></p> <p><span>McCain, at bottom, is concerned with an old problem, addressed eloquently by William James a little less than a century ago: How can a nation preserve the martial virtues--McCain's \"selfless devotion to a cause\"--during peacetime? Or, as James put it: Whence comes a moral equivalent of war?</span></p> <p><span>James suggested mandatory community service, others offered football and others business. All found some surrogate cause to replace defense of one's country; something akin to team spirit would replace wartime patriotism.</span></p> <p><span>But McCain, who was captured by the Vietnamese while George W. Bush was entering his junior year at Yale, wants unabashed patriotism and consequently some national cause for which citizens can sacrifice. As he told the students at Johns Hopkins, \"we have a new patriotic challenge for a new century: declaring war on the cynicism that threatens our public institutions, our culture and, ultimately, our private happiness. It is a great and just cause. And service in it will be an honor.\" From this idea--this proposal for a moral equivalent of war--flows McCain's passion for campaign finance reform and, indeed, most of his campaign's energy.</span></p> <p><span>Public Cynicism may not be the most rousing cause, but it's the best available. Were the nation at war, McCain would be a natural choice. Alas, he has the misfortune of being a great man running for president at a time when his country doesn't really need great men.</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, some have answered McCain's call and seem eager to sacrifice for his cause. There have, of course, been other heroic presidents--FDR and Reagan most recently--elected to work towards a cause, whether fighting the Depression, the Nazis or the Communists. McCain, however, is a war hero; consequently, the cause his supporters fight for--combatting public cynicism and restoring honor to the White House--is coeval with electing him president.</span></p> <p><span>For those students who believe in McCain, who believe that public cynicism is a pressing problem deserving self-sacrifice, it's hard not to take the election seriously. Perhaps this, then, is why the boos drowned out the cheers as Bush's victories scrolled across the IOP screen.</span></p> <p><span><i>Hugh P.

Rather than continuing to appeal primarily to party voters, each candidate will begin to position himself for the general electorate.</span></p> <p><span>Bill White, director of the ARCO Forum at the Institute of Politics, said the general election will hinge not upon the votes of those firmly entrenched with either party, but on the 20 percent of Americans who comprise the \"swing vote\" and have traditionally determined the eventual winner.</span></p> <p><span>Gore, however, has a head start.</span></p> <p><span>\"Bush and Gore are going to hustle to move to the center,\" White said. \"Because of McCain running to the left of Bush, George Bush has more to do to work to get to the center.\"</span></p> <p><span>With his plans for universal health coverage and \"big ideas,\" Bill Bradley appealed most to unreformed liberals. But Gore focused his efforts on attacking Bradley's proposals as too risky, and as portraying himself as the safe Democratic alternative for centrist voters.</span></p> <p><span>McCain, on the other hand, had tremendous moderate and Democratic appeal. And while McCain's cross-party drawing power served him well in early primaries, Bush was able to wait out the McCain tide by appealing to party-line Republicans and the religious right.</span></p> <p><span>But Bush's pandering to the Republican right is undoubtedly giving Gore fodder for the general election, and Bush's amazing cash reserves have been drawn down during his primary battles. And Gore has remained in the center while Bush is tilting rightward.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Life After Death? </b><p> </p><p></p></font>John McCain may have failed to win the Republican nomination, but his widespread popularity means that he will still have an impact on the general election.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>McCain may decide to cash in on his popularity with moderates and join the Reform Party.</span></p> <p><span>\"[McCain's] staff is interested in going to a third party,\" White said.</span></p> <p><span>If he does declare, McCain has enough support to be eligible to participate in all presidential debates, White said.</span></p> <p><span>Although White said current Reform Party rules would make it virtually impossible for McCain to get his name on the party ballot, the troubled party might decide to alter its rules to accommodate the Arizona senator.</span></p> <p><span>Even if the Reform Party does welcome McCain, the senator faces other logistical problems if he wishes to switch parties. He would have to drop out of the Republican Party and thus lose his spot as chair of the Senate Commerce Committee.</span></p> <p><span>\"The practical side of that is that it's very unlikely that McCain could get on the ballot,\" White said.</span></p> <p><span>Another theory has McCain becoming Bush's running mate. This arrangement would help solve Bush's perceived alienation from moderates and independents.</span></p> <p><span>Presidential nominees have chosen their primary opponents as running mates before. In 1980, Ronald Reagan selected George H.W. Bush after a contested primary season. John F. Kennedy '40 chose primary opponent Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960. Both nominees won their general elections.</span></p> <p><span>The chances of Bush and McCain running together are currently slim, however, simply because the two have spent months attacking each other and are not likely to reconcile their differences by the summer.</span></p> <p><span>\"They'll be a lot of Republican operatives that would want [McCain] on the ticket,\" White said. \"But the two are not likely compatible enough.\"</span></p> <p><span>Thus far, McCain said he has no plans to run with Bush.</span></p> <p><span>Even if McCain decides to drop out of the presidential race entirely, he can still help the Republican Party by endorsing Bush.</span></p> <p><span>On the other hand, silence from McCain or--worse yet--continued criticism of Bush and the Christian right might paralyze Bush's attempt to win moderate votes.</span></p> <p><span>Recently, Bush told Fox News that he would hope to hear from the McCain campaign and hopes the pair can put all animosity behind them.</span></p> <p><span>Whether McCain is ready to do this is uncertain.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Toughening Up  </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Contested presidential primaries are not all bad for the eventual winner. Most political pundits believe that facing a challenge in the primary may toughen a candidate and his campaign, making him more successful in the general election.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Stephen Walt, Kirkpatrick Professor of International Affairs at the Kennedy School of Government, said that an easy primary victory might actually hurt a candidate's chances in November.</span></p> <p><span>\"If you have a real easy time of it, your campaign machinery may not be ready for the real campaign,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>While Bush was clearly challenged by McCain, Bradley's impact on Gore is less clear.</span></p> <p><span>After winning narrowly in New Hampshire, Gore has coasted for the last few weeks. Meanwhile, Bradley's support consistently dwindled, and Bradley himself has backed off on his attacks, perhaps realizing that his chances for winning the nomination were virtually nonexistent.</span></p> <p><span>Although Gore has not been tested since early February, White says Bradley offered enough competition before the New Hampshire primary to sufficiently challenge Gore.</span></p> <p><span>\"Bradley definitely made Al Gore a better candidate,\" White said.</span></p> <p><span>On the other hand, a primary that is too contentious might hurt the eventual nominee. In Bush's case, McCain's frequent attacks against him means he can clearly emerge from the Republican primaries battle-tested, but he may appear vulnerable as well.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's always a problem when a party is bitterly divided during the primary season,\" Walt said. \"Whoever wins has accumulated so much baggage that they become a weaker candidate in the general election.\"</span></p> <p><span>Above all, the negative campaigning between Bush and McCain likely helped Gore most. Gore enjoys the benefits of negative attacks against Bush without appearing as a negative campaigner.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>The Next Quayle? </b><p> </p><p></p></font>The next major step for Bush and Gore will be to choose running mates. Traditionally, running mates are chosen in order to shore up a candidate's weaknesses, thus broadening his appeal to those voters who might otherwise not support him.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Potential running mates from large states have an advantage, as they help candidates win their states' important electoral votes.</span></p> <p><span>For this reason, Gore, solidly entrenched with moderate Democrats, might choose a more liberal running mate. Senators Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) and Bob Graham (D-Fla.) have been mentioned as top candidates, although both are not much more liberal than Gore. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) would help bring the country's biggest electoral prize to Gore.</span></p> <p><span>Bush faces a more interesting choice. Although he could stick with a solid conservative, Bush may decide to appeal to moderate voters and pick a pro-choice running mate. Popular state governors Tom Ridge '70 (R-Pa.) and Christine Todd Whitman (R-N.J.) both support abortion rights.</span></p> <p><span>Whitman, along with running-mate possibility Elizabeth Dole, might win over women voters, who tend not to support the Republican Party.</span></p> <p><span>Recently, Christian right leader Jerry Falwell said he would endorse Bush even if the candidate chose a pro-choice candidate.</span></p> <p><span>Still, all speculations on the candidates' running mates are relatively premature. Few expected 1996 Republican nominee Bob Dole to pick Jack Kemp as his running mate. Even fewer thought President Clinton would pick fellow southerner Gore.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Too Early To Handicap </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Although Gore's relatively easy ride through the primary season might make him appear to be ahead of the game now, it's far too early to even pick a favorite for the general election.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Bush won the support of women and minorities as governor of Texas, and he may repeat that feat nationally. If successful, Bush would not only find himself winning moderate voters, but he would gain some of the traditionally Democratic vote as well.</span></p> <p><span>Additionally, McCain's attacks on the Republican establishment--particularly the Christian right--might compel the Republican Party to reform itself and go after a larger spectrum of voters.</span></p> <p><span>\"Many people thought that [McCain's attacks] was a message that the Republican Party needed to hear,\" Walt said. \"I think he's been tremendously good for the Republican Party.\"</span></p> <p><span>With Election Day still months away, the small advantages of today might become irrelevant come November.</span></p> <p><span>\"I've learned never to be confident of my forecasts,\" Walt said. \"Michael Dukakis had a 17-point lead at one point, and we all know how that election turned out.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: A Place to Leave Up the Confederate Flag | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The primary battle in South between Ariz. Sen. John S. McCain and Tex. Gov. George W. Bush has created an interesting side debate about the candidates' relationship to the antebellum South, most visibly seen in the acrimony over the Confederate flag in South Carolina.</span></p> <p><span>But this is only the best known example of a war of words to tar the Republican contenders as overly sympathetic to the \"Old South.\" A civil rights think tank took Bush to task for writing letters on behalf of the respected Museum of the Confederacy and holding a fund-raising ball where guests dressed in 19th century costume. Dealing with periods of history where ideas were espoused that we now see as wrong has always been a difficult problem, but the attacks on Bush are the wrong way to deal with the dubious legacy of the Confederacy.</span></p> <p><span>The Romans dealt with this through the ritual of <i>damnatio memoriae</i>, the condemnation of memory. To make it seem as if as a vicious person had never lived, all statues of him were destroyed or recarved, his name effaced from public inscriptions and documents related to him destroyed. The ritual provided a clear message that his behavior had been unacceptable and tried to remove the blot on the history of Rome that his crimes had created.</span></p> <p><span>The uproar over Bush's casual involvement with those interested in the \"Southern heritage\" reflects the same approach to uncomfortable periods of history. All memory of a period when great crimes were committed must be expunged and remembered only for the great mistakes that were made. This is not a mature way to approach the past. It is vitally important that we understand and accept that all societies and eras had flaws, just as in contemporary America there is much that does not accord with our highest principles. The best memorial to the sufferings of the past is not to tar history with a broad brush but to strive to understand the complex nature of the societies that perpetrated wrong.</span></p> <p><span>The attack on Bush's support for the Museum of the Confederacy is fundamentally different from the debates over the custom of flying Confederate flag in South Carolina, which was not even a genuine tradition but a crude attempt to spite the Civil Rights Movement. The debate over the flag was a debate over what image a state government should project to all its citizens, and such images can and should change as the sensibilities of the people change.</span></p> <p><span>Attacking the Museum of the Confederacy is an attack on the serious study of history. This museum is not some glorified Klan hall but a serious and respected academic and historical institution. It is especially foolish to denounce the study of such a vitally formative period in American history. Corrupting bias comes as much from the defenders of right as from revisionists and apologists. In a very real sense much of the human tragedy of the Civil War and the great suffering of slavery have been in vain if memory is corrupted and distorted for political ends.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Delicate Work Ahead on China | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>These are the times that try diplomats' souls. Two days after relations between the United States and China were reported as finally \"on the mend\" after the May bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, China issued a report Feb. 21 threatening Taiwan with military attack if it delayed reunification with the mainland.  The threat came at an exceedingly bad time for the Clinton administration, which is gearing up for a coming fight on China's entry into the World Trade Organization, in which it will have to counter both union opposition and new reports of Chinese human rights violations. The administration will have to act quickly to restore political support for positive U.S.-Sino relations and to make it clear to China how much has been jeopardized.</span></p> <p><span>The release of the 11,000-word report seems almost designed to upset the political applecart in the U.S.--in the many diplomatic meetings since the May bombing, some of which discussed Taiwan at length, no mention was made by Chinese officials of the shift in policy.  Perhaps the U.S. should have expected some kind of \"February surprise\" before the Taiwanese elections; after all, the last time Taiwan had presidential elections, in 1996, China fired missiles off the Taiwan coast in a none-too-subtle warning.</span></p> <p><span>Yet China's declaration that its patience could wear thin at any time raises the dangerous possibility that China has become more willing to use military force to achieve its political ends, and thereby represents a real escalation of the tensions across the Taiwan strait. Unfortunately, China's threats seem likely to spawn a vicious cycle of mistrust, making it only more likely that the Senate will vote to sell additional defense equipment to Taiwan, further angering the Chinese government.</span></p> <p><span>This cycle is likely to tighten the political pincer movement in which the movement for strong U.S.-China relations has found itself.  The AFL-CIO and other labor groups have been outspoken in their opposition to China's entry into the WTO, and have placed substantial pressure on presidential candidate and Vice President Al Gore '69 to change his stance.  Meanwhile, the far right has focused on China's worsening human rights record; the State Department's annual human rights report used harsher terms to describe China's actions this year regarding political and religious freedoms than in any year since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.  The Republican leadership in Congress has tried to find a balance by holding a tough line on Taiwan while advocating normal trading relations, but it is unclear whether this balance is sustainable.</span></p> <p><span>All of this makes Clinton's response even more vital.  With the debate on normal trading relations with China (a precursor to WTO entry) on hold due to a breakdown in talks between China and the European Union, now is the time for Clinton to make a strong case for open trade with China. China's entry into the WTO would give the world one more lever to secure economic, if not political, openness and to encourage the rising class of Chinese reformers. Clinton has made the case that economic freedom will necessarily lead to better political conditions, but has cited little in the way of results. We are encouraged, however, by the examples of China's \"special economic zones,\" where greater economic freedom has led to a less heavy-handed political culture, which hopefully would be more reluctant to make irresponsible military threats.</span></p> <p><span>Environmental and labor issues must also be addressed.  Although the full details of the trade pact the U.S. made with China in November will not be released until China's negotiations with the E.U. have ended successfully, if that pact's environmental and labor protections are insufficient, bilateral agreements on these issues should be pursued along with WTO entry.</span></p> <p><span>Through the WTO, the U.S. has a unique opportunity to induce China to abide by the rules of the world community in at least one arena.  If China aspires to great-power status (and it does), it is better that the U.S. allow it to pursue its aspirations within the current international system than in opposition to it.  The Clinton administration must overcome this ill-timed bluster with a clear statement of what the U.S. has to gain from treating China as an equal.  Otherwise, the political consensus for a wise policy will disappear.</span></p>"}

Big party machines can distract representatives from practical concerns toward hot political issues, like gun control and abortion. When this happens, the bite, or at least the bark, of these little renegades brings the Washington big-wigs back to the mundane, but vital, fiscal reality.</span></p> <p><span>In 1992, then-incumbent George H. Bush was dragging his feet and the former governor from Arkansas, a candidate for a new generation, was tending ever more towards the center. Ross Perot, a billionaire from Texas, put up over $60 million out of his own pocket to run for president on a platform centered on reducing federal spending, balancing the budget and term limits.</span></p> <p><span>After garnering 19 percent of the national vote in 1992, Perot's organization, \"United We Stand America,\" created the Reform Party. Perot's showing in 1992 gained him federal funding for 1996, and his showing in 1996--exceeding the 5 percent federal funding minimum--ensured matching federal funding for the Reform Party presidential candidates in this year's election. Perot's showing in 1996 secured a place for Reform candidates on 21 states' ballots, and petitioning secured the remaining 39.</span></p> <p><span>Although the only Reform Party candidate to be elected to a major political office is Minn. Gov. Jesse Ventura, a solid economic focus and a refreshing lack of politicking in the Party has forced the two traditional parties to refocus on the fundamentals of politics.</span></p> <p><span>When fiscal platforms and even social platforms were becoming hypnotically indistinguishable between Democrats and Republicans, the Reform Party brought this problem into sharp focus and demanded the revitalization of these increasingly complacent juggernauts.</span></p> <p><span>But these days, the Reform Party has lost its edge. Having now lost the support of its founder and its only successful candidate, the party has stopped being a whetstone to sharpen the political system. Instead, it has become another harmless fringe party on par with the Libertarians. The Reform Party needs to disband rather than go the way of groups like the NRA.</span></p> <p><span>The Reform Party has performed an invaluable service to American politics. It has demanded serious consideration of more mundane political issues and opened up the nepotism of Washington society.

Midterms are approaching, the need to show leadership in extracurriculars is growing, and judging by that smell, a giant baby has spit up in your common room (or maybe that's just my common room). We Harvard students live in a tourist attraction with movie stars and geniuses; we're recognized on all continents as the crme of the brulee, the syrup on the pancakes of greatness. Yet most of us complain like vegans at a barbecue cook-off.</span></p> <p><span>Scientists for many years refused to believe it: Students who, in high school, worked like Harvard was Salvation with sweatshirts couldn't possibly complain once they got there (except, ahem, about the Senior Gift). Lately, though, researchers have admitted it does happen, \"But it's like doing Buns of Steel for four years and then sticking your head up your finely-tuned ass.\"</span></p> <p><span>The problem is perspective. Spend three months as a Harvard student and you've got less real-world perspective than Michael Jackson Jr. (or, as he is affectionately known around the Jackson house, \"Not the Monkey\"). Of course, your cocky perspective from high school wasn't right either. Only Harvard students keep the same career goal, \"quarterback/poet/sorcerer/King of Illinois\" from first through twelfth grade. But it changed for the worse during your first year in Cambridge.</span></p> <p><span>Get an A- on the midterm, and your roommate gets an A. Become treasurer of a club? A kid in Matthews is president of Tufts University. And it never gets better. Thesis writers are constantly reminded that their work could never be as good as the thesis of Henry A. Kissinger '50. His was 350 pages long, written in his own blood and \"interpreted\" by a troupe of dancing lizards he trained himself. Could you top that? Not likely. And so we stress and complain like mad. Sometimes, to see the glum, hopeless looks across this campus, you'd think the North Face factory had burned down (ba dum bum).</span></p> <p><span>How can we fix this problem? There's a simple solution: the Harvard Corps. For one semester out of their eight, Harvard students would be forced to leave Cambridge and travel to far-off parts of the United States to do community service. The rest of this column might possibly be funny, but it's not a joke.</span></p> <p><span>Corps participants would be divided into small groups (so they wouldn't only talk to each other), and sent to work in places where summa is a prepositional phrase (\"the summa two and four is six\") and the people are still happy and normal. The students could tutor, babysit, paint houses, sack groceries or wait tables; whatever needs doing and isn't getting done. The Harvard Corp's tasks might not be exactly like the Peace Corps. For instance, a village well dug by VES concentrators might periodically shoot out flame and speak in the voice of John Lennon, making village life difficult. But the idea is basically the same. Just like playing third base for the Chicago Cubs, there will be no opportunities to \"win\" or satisfy the need to \"beat\" other people or groups. The aim is service and not success.</span></p> <p><span>What Harvard students will get out of the program is a realization that Ivy League degrees are as rare in this world as atlases in the George W. Bush household. Millions of people would give literally anything to get their kids into a school like Harvard, and millions more simple admire it as another, brighter world. Knowing them and what they think of the opportunity you've got, it'll be a lot harder to whine about Group II. Out in the Real World, you'll hear what someone should have told you since your first day in the Yard: you've already made it. So work hard, but for the love of Henry A. Kissinger '50, don't whine about it.</span></p> <p><span>I doubt Harvard would ever do anything like this--its general attitude seems to be that innovative student-life programs are for weak sissy colleges. Mandate a semester off and you might as well change the school colors to yellow and granola. The official excuse would probably be that students need all 32 half-courses to really complete a Harvard education. Really. I seriously doubt that you'll even remember what you learned in Literature and Arts B-57, \"Leonardo da Vinci Meets Leonardo di Caprio\" two years later--in its place will be jokes you got over e-mail and \"Dawson's Creek\" plotlines. The Harvard Corps experience would last a lifetime.</span></p> <p><span>But finding that experience--during the summers or through community service during term-time--is probably up to you. Internalize Harvard's value system and you'll find yourself in 30 years standing alone at cocktail parties, talking about your bonus, your six-year-old's batting average and your wine cellar. Occasionally, among Ivy-League crowds, you'll say \"Habermas\" and mean it--you won't be sneezing. It's a sad, bleak existence, filled with sun-dried tomatoes and pretending to like jazz. But it doesn't have to be that way.</span></p> <p><span>The Harvard Corps. Be all that you can be. And smile when you say that, mister.</span></p> <p><span><i>David A.

Though he once opposed Medicare-funding abortions, he now fully supports them.</span></p> <p><span>But some of his positions and convictions have held. Gore has been a staunch supporter of affirmative action programs. He has supported nuclear arms reduction and test-ban treaties for his entire Congressional career.</span></p> <p><span>This campaign, Gore has extended his New Democrat themes. On crime, he supports the death penalty and the \"three strikes and you're out\" sentencing guidelines--but he opposes sentencing disparities for cocaine offenses and racial profiling.</span></p> <p><span>Gore proposes to spend more than $100 billion on federal education programs.

He supports the granting of most-favored nation trading status for China.</span></p> <p><span>Tagged as an environmental extremist, Gore has considered ecological preservation as a cornerstore of his career.

The next he will be extending invitations to the next round of guests.</span></p> <p><span>But however varied his tasks, the University marshal's office is above all a public relations apparatus--another arm of the extensive Harvard system, designed to coordinate the image the University presents when delegates leave the campus and preparing a ceremonious welcome for all visitors.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Presenting a Pretty Face  </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Whenever any student organization or school within the University wishes to invite a well-known scholar, government official, or public figure to visit and speak here, the University Marshal's office is the first necessary stopping point.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>\"The University Marshal's office handles visits from international visitors who come on an official basis and very regularly,\" Hunt says. \"It is our responsibility to set up appointments so they can meet people.\"</span></p> <p><span>All outside speakers at the Kennedy School of Government (KSG) pass through the marshal's office on their way to the ARCO Forum--in addition to visitors at any of Harvard's other eight tubs.</span></p> <p><span>His office also sends out all invitations to national and international figures asked by individual schools or professors to visit Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>\"It may not seem very complex, but it is,\" Hunt says. \"It involves being sure an invitation that goes out is not going to conflict with an invitation that is outstanding.\"</span></p> <p><span>Hunt's office is welcoming to all, he says. Because it serves merely as the clearing house for coordinating and sending invitations to prospective visitors, it doesn't take political positions.</span></p> <p><span>\"If a group wishes to invite someone, our policy is to be hospitable and to arrange meetings,\" Hunt says. \"Our main goal is to be sure that invitations aren't overlapping.\"</span></p> <p><span>Harvard is not always the one to take initiative in inviting dignitaries.</span></p> <p><span>Through World Boston Organization, an arm of the State Department, people from around the world request to speak with Harvard faculty members. The University marshal's office will provide the link between the outside world and Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>\"We get a real range of people, including journalists, lawyers, judges and scientists that come from 80-90 countries,\" says Jill R. Chamberlain, assistant director for administration who works in the marshal's office.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, it is Hunt's responsibility to appoint delegates to represent Harvard at different universities and professional associations in the United States and in other countries and to coordinate their trips. The University usually disperses 60 delegates to the four corners of the world.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>The Loose Ends </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Beyond the high-profile tasks of inviting and receiving the visitors, Hunt must coordinate the behind-the-scenes details of pomp and circumstance.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>To prepare for visits, the University Marshal advises particular groups and organizations on protocol for certain visitors. For example, Hunt says, his office frequently instructs students and faculty on the proper way to greet visitors and to write invitations or thank you notes.</span></p> <p><span>Hunt works closely with the Crimson Key Society to organize tours and orientation sessions for interested visitors.</span></p> <p><span>\"The undergraduates know the undergraduate life,\" he says. \"So they can best give informational tours of Harvard Yard, Widener, etc.\"</span></p> <p><span>And, of course, there is always the important job of hanging the correct flag from the Yard side of University Hall when foreign visitors come.</span></p> <p><span>When a high-profile visitor arrives, Hunt also helps with security arrangements.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>The Best Autograph Book </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Perhaps most important of Hunt's duties is as keeper of the guest book.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Every time an important national or international visitor comes to Harvard, the first stop is usually Hunt's plush and ornately decorated office. Each visitor then signs the official guest book, of which there are eight or nine volumes that date back 30 or 40 years.</span></p> <p><span>\"They're an autograph collector's dream,\" Hunt says.</span></p> <p><span>The most interesting signature, he says, is that of Jiang Zemin, the president of China.</span></p> <p><span>\"Jiang Zemin took the entire page,\" Hunt says. \"He said, would we mind if he used a brush. His signature looked like calligraphy in Chinese.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"The interesting thing is that the day before, [Vice President] Al Gore was here and signed his name very little. Jiang Zemin noticed that he took the whole page and Vice President Gore signed much smaller, but said, 'It's because our country China is much bigger,'\" he adds.</span></p> <p><span>Hunt's office bears witness to the many visitors who have signed the book over the years. Gifts from famous guests line the walls.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Commencement Duties </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Commencement, the longest continuous running springtime festival in American history, also falls under the umbrella of responsibilities of the University Marshal.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>\"I help plan and coordinate the event,\" Hunt says, noting the</span></p> <p><span>complexities of planning for the more than 30,000 degree candidates, parents, visitors, friends and faculty who attend each year.</span></p> <p><span>Along with Commencement, Hunt coordinates the honorary degree, which are awarded each spring at the ceremony</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>A Job Well-Liked </b><p> </p><p></p></font>One might then expect that after meeting more than 1,100 leaders and scholars each year, Hunt might not be wowed by anyone. But according to him, it's always incredible to see world leaders and scholars.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>\"There's no question that the most awesome individual, the most awesome moral figure, that I've met is Nelson Mandela,\" Hunt says.</span></p> <p><span>More and more, Hunt said, when foreign officials visit Washington for official visits, many stop in Boston.</span></p> <p><span>\"It puts Harvard on the map, and is good in many ways,\" he said. \"It helps us be a place people feel they have profited from visiting.\"</span></p>"}

{"title": "On the Issues: Bill Bradley | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Bill Bradley looked to be on a roll last November.  He had a double-digit lead against Al Gore '69 in New Hampshire, was raking in campaign dollars across the rest of the country, and was causing Gore to change his campaign strategy. The vice-president acknowledged, for the first time, that he had competition for the Democratic nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Would a sitting vice president seeking his party's nomination might be denied for the first time in American history?</span></p> <p><span>But going in to today's Democratic primaries and caucuses, Bradley trails Gore in just about every demographic in just about every state in the country.</span></p> <p><span>Though most Democratic observers concede that his candidate is in its twilight, Bradley has made a conscientious effort to keep focused on a core group of issues, including health care, campaign finance reform, race relations, and education.</span></p> <p><span>He appeals to the party's liberal wing--garnering the solid endorsement of Harvard's liberal monthly, the <i>Perspective</i>.</span></p> <p><span>Bradley has spent most of his campaigning propounding and defending his plan to provide universal health care coverage. Under the plan proposed by Bradley, the 44 million Americans without health care would be able to enroll in the health care plan that covers federal employees. Tax subsidies, the amounts of which would vary by income, would be provided to uninsured individuals to cover the program's premium.</span></p> <p><span>This system would eventually replace the Medicaid system that currently provides insurance to the poor.  Medicare, the insurance system for the elderly, would be maintained under Bradley's plan and expanded to provide prescription drug benefits.</span></p> <p><span>Bradley's proposal to replace the Medicare system has come under strong attack from Gore.  Gore says that Bradley's plan will hurt the poor, because the replacement would provide too low of a subsidy to individuals to buy insurance. Bradley strongly denies this and attacks Gore for proposing a system which does not include universal health care.</span></p> <p><span>In keeping with Bradley's focus on care, he also proposes an ambitious plan to end child poverty \"as we know it.\" He proposes increasing the minimum wage to $6.15 an hour.  He promises to spend federal education dollars to place 60,000 new teachers in poor and rural areas of the country.  He also proposes to expand the earned income tax credit (which would allow poorer families to keep more of their money) and to provide tax credits and other incentives for affordable childcare.</span></p> <p><span>Another chief focus of the Bradley campaign has been the reform of the national campaign finance system. He proposes requiring television stations to give election candidates free air time before the election and proposes public financing of Congressional elections. He also proposes ending the ability to give unlimited contributions to political parties, known as soft-money donations.</span></p> <p><span>Bradley, in increasing his criticism of Gore in recent weeks, has criticized Gore's fundraising efforts during the 1996 campaign presidential campaign, which included the vice president holding a fundraiser in a Buddhist temple.</span></p> <p><span>Race relations are another focus of the Bradley campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\"Race is one of the fundamental elements of my campaign. . . . It is who I am, it's what I live,\" he has said. In nearly every stump speech, Bradley says he has a deep commitment in furthering racial unity, which has been present since his days as a professional basketball player. As President, Bradley says he would sign an executive order ending racial profiling. He says he would work hard to maintain and expand affirmative action programs. And he says he would hold his staff accountable for their own commitment to racial justice.</span></p> <p><span>However, despite this focus, Bradley has gained very little support among most black voters.  Polls of southern black voters, a key Democratic constituency, shows they overwhelmingly support Al Gore.</span></p> <p><span>Bill Bradley was born in 1943 in Crystal City, Mo., where he lived until he left to attend college at Princeton University. There, he was a star on the school's basketball team. After graduation in 1965, he attended Oxford University on a Rhodes Scholarship.  He then had a successful 10 year career in the National Basketball Association, playing as guard for the New York Knicks. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1982.</span></p> <p><span>Bradley entered politics, running for and winning election as a U.S. Senator from New Jersey in 1978. He served in this position for three terms and retired into the private sector in 1996.</span></p>"}

Even on a campus of roaming ethernet network connections, Rudenstine does not have an e-mail account.</span></p> <p><span>As a result of this hands-off style, Rudenstine sometimes comes across as being too insular and distanced from undergraduates. Several years ago, for example, as the College buzzed about the first-ever, campus-wide elections of the Undergraduate Council's president and vice president, Rudenstine was oblivious to the sea of colorful campaign posters visible from his office window--he had no idea that the elections were happening.</span></p> <p><span>Rudenstine's defenders say that his burdens as president are too daunting for him to meddle in College affairs, and they may have a point.</span></p> <p><span>Rudenstine has worked tirelessly almost from the day he took office to help pad Harvard's coffers. His legacy will be marked by the six-year, $2.6 billion capital campaign over which he presided--the largest fundraising drive in the history of higher education.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to fundraising, the president's other major roles include approving tenure decisions for all nine of Harvard's faculties, overseeing the activities of upper-level bureaucrats and shaping the University's long-term direction and policies.</span></p> <p><span>Rudentsine's decision this May to resign did not come as a huge surprise--many anticipated that he would step down soon after the end of the capital campaign. The 65-year-old former Rhodes Scholar said he felt it was \"the right time\" to move on.</span></p> <p><span>As a result, the University is currently conducting an exhausting search for Harvard's 27th president.

The provost is also responsible for fostering academic collaboration among Harvard's nine faculties--a task that is easier said than done.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Fineberg, Rudenstine's third provost in eight years, is Rudentsine's taller shadow. Slim and a bit goofy looking, Fineberg is cool and unflappable under pressure.</span></p> <p><span>Like Rudentsine, Fineberg's involvement in undergraduate life is minimal.

This board approves appointments and oversees the allotment of millions of dollars in each year's operating budget.</span></p> <p><span>It's a responsibility that the Corporation takes very seriously. So seriously, in fact, that the body is best known for the secrecy permeating all of its activities. The Corporation selects its own members for life-long terms. It publishes no minutes of its meetings and most of its members never speak to the press.</span></p> <p><span>The senior fellow is Robert G. Stone Jr. '45, the chair and CEO of the Kirby Corporation.

{"title": "In Final Appearance, Simpson Leads Panel on Gay Vote | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In his last appearance as the director of the Institute of Politics (IOP), former senator Alan K. Simpson moderated a two-person discussion about the influence of the gay vote in the 2000 elections yesterday.</span></p> <p><span>The crowd of 60 filled the Starr Auditorium at the Kennedy School of Government (KSG). Richard Tafel, the executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans--the nation's largest gay and lesbian Republican organization--and Jeff Trammell, a senior policy advisor to Vice President Al Gore, mused about the importance of the gay population in politics, the history of the gay vote and the future of what has become a mainstream movement.</span></p> <p><span>In the year 2000, Tafel said, Democrats are fighting \"aggressively for the gay vote,\" and the \"gay community [is] now a winning issue.\"</span></p> <p><span>He went on to say that gays have \"had an antagonistic relationship with George W. Bush, Jr.,\" but added that at Super Tuesday, Bush promised to meet more with gay groups.</span></p> <p><span>Trammell echoed Tafel, saying, \"I think this is a watershed year. That we're finally being honest about who we are is remarkable.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the question and answer period that followed, Trammell talked about the key role of political coalitions between gay and other interest groups in fighting for gay rights.</span></p> <p><span>\"Nothing is more important than building bridges,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Tafel emphasized that gain that can result from a political loss.</span></p> <p><span>He said that initiatives, even those defeated in state or federal legislatures, can raise support for the gay rights movement. He drew on one example of a Colorado man who donated millions of dollars to the movement after the failure of a gay initiative in his state.</span></p> <p><span>And he focused on the importance of local legislation.</span></p> <p><span>\"All change percolates up. [It's] unwise to focus on a federal strategy,\" Tafel said.</span></p> <p><span>The panelists did not jump immediately into a discussion of current politics--they each opened their comments with a brief history of the gay vote.</span></p> <p><span>Tafel began with 1988, saying, \"It was a different world then. [There was] nothing on the radar screen for Republicans.\"</span></p> <p><span>He gave President Clinton credit for bringing gay rights to the forefront. He said George Bush and Pat Buchanan did not do the same.</span></p> <p><span>However, according to Tafel, Bob Dole's 1996 endorsement of the Log Cabin party marked a successful change for Republicans.</span></p> <p><span>Trammell pinned his comments on statistics. He made reference to the five percent of the population which identified themselves as gay in 1996 and then pointed out that that number went up to  11 percent at the California Democratic Primary of 2000.</span></p> <p><span>Both candidates said the gay vote will be very important come November. Tafel called the gay issue \"mainstream\" and the gay community a \"coalition with the swing vote.\"</span></p> <p><span>Trammell said the question is no longer how to avoid the gay vote, but rather how to attract it.</span></p> <p><span>\"We are going to be seen as a group that is like any other group of Americans,\" he added.</span></p> <p><span>For most of the discussion and questions, both panelists avoided partisan commentary. However, Trammell labelled George W. Bush's attempt to meet with gays in Austin, Texas insufficient.</span></p> <p><span>Tafel called for the end of what he called \"cartooning\" or labeling of gays as one group. He said gays are not \"monolithic.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Filling Rudenstine's Shoes | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>A little over a week ago, Dean of Harvard Business School (HBS) Kim B. Clark '74 was explaining to a Sanders Theatre audience how technology advances business education.</span></p> <p><span>He presented a practice management simulation in which a woman told her boss that she wouldn't attend a meeting since it wasn't a productive use of her time.</span></p> <p><span>There were three ways to deal with her: A) wait until she did it again and then confront her about it B) bite the bullet and talk to her or C) talk to her immediate superior about how to handle the situation.</span></p> <p><span>Clark turned to Provost Harvey V. Fineberg '67, who was sitting in the front row, and asked him to pick the solution.</span></p> <p><span>Fineberg chose B, and Clark played out the result. Sanders rocked with laughter as the simulation showed the tactless boss offending her employee, telling her she had a reputation for not being a collaborator.</span></p> <p><span>\"Now, as you can see,\" Clark joked with the audience, \"Harvey's in the soup.\"</span></p> <p><span>For some in the audience, it was more than a little amusing to watch Clark and Fineberg joshing about management style. The two are currently considered the top contenders to succeed their outgoing boss, President Neil L. Rudenstine.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, for the next year, Fineberg and Clark are in the proverbial soup--already under scrutiny by the Harvard community and the nation as the University tries to equip itself for the post-Rudenstine era.</span></p> <p><span>The echoes of his resignation announcement had barely faded away before the speculation started. As the University embarks on its 27th presidential search, the possible leaders most frequently named are internal administrators with strong management and academic records.</span></p> <p><span>But for the first time, those possibilities strongly reflect a University evolving in a more business-oriented, technological age.</span></p> <p><span>Clark has been praised for bridging the gap between the business school--long a distant empire of its own--and the rest of the University. Popularly anointed the frontrunner, he is also known for his progressive thinking about technology. His administrative style is distinctly decentralized--and he is known for hacking away at red tape.</span></p> <p><span>Fineberg, meanwhile, holds a relatively new position that--unlike a deanship--remains untested as a training ground for the Harvard presidency. Nevertheless, he is not far behind. His own interests and specialties, also focus on technology and science; he served as dean of the School of Public Health (SPH) for 13 years before his appointment as provost.</span></p> <p><span>Both are widely regarded as superb candidates. But of course, things are rarely that simple. Although Clark and Fineberg have the home field advantage, Harvard politics make them more complex possibilities than they may initially seem.</span></p> <p><span>Fineberg's current position may be more a liability than an asset, and Clark's business background makes some traditionalists shake their heads.</span></p> <p><span>And these two are hardly the only names currently bantered around University boardrooms and conference tables. The list gleaned<b> </b>from people in the know suggests that only one thing is for sure: the Harvard presidential search committee's top prospects won't necessarily be coming from just the usual places. They will have to look far from Harvard's core--for example, at Stanford, to HBS and the Harvard Medical School (HMS).</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>How To Pick a President </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Rudenstine's last day is June 30, 2001. Which means they have a year to pick. The University search engine is not officially mobilized, the committee still unformed, the search process is as yet undefined.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>But using the procedure of past searches as a guide, the committee will likely include the entire Harvard Corporation, the six fellows who are both the University's highest governing body and its owners. Senior Fellow Robert G. Stone '45 will chair the group. The Corporation will pick its candidate and then ask the Board of Overseers for its consent.</span></p> <p><span>\"There are, in history, some times when they didn't like the choice and it took some trying for the consent to be given,\" says Charles P. Slichter '45, a former member of the Corporation who chaired the last presidential search. \"The problem is for the Overseers to feel that they are sufficiently knowledgeable about the nominees and process to give consent.\"</span></p> <p><span><b></b>As part of an effort to make sure this link exists, the committee will likely include several members of the Overseers, Harvard's second highest governing body.</span></p> <p><span><b></b>Rudenstine has said he will not be involved. The committee is unlikely to break with tradition to include faculty members, students or alumni, and will likely be kept small in an effort to avoid publicity.</span></p> <p><span>The search committee will not use an academic headhunting firm, those familiar with the process say. They don't need one. Using the Harvard network, they can reach around the globe.</span></p> <p><span>Over the next year, this select group will canvass the Harvard community and groups of higher education experts, composing lists and scratching off names. In the last search, the group sent out 200,000 letters to faculty, staff, alumni and students, soliciting suggestions.</span></p> <p><span>\"A search process is not only a search for a person, it's also a process through which the larger community helps to identify what those larger priorities tend to be...what directions, opportunities might be most significant in the coming period of time,\" says Hanna H. Gray, a member of the Corporation and former president of the University of Chicago.</span></p> <p><span>Former president of the Board of Overseers Charlotte P. Armstrong '49 notes that the search this time could prove to be different than in the past.</span></p> <p><span>Rudenstine's predecessor, Derek C. Bok, arrived at a campus shaken by the turmoil of the 1960s. He stayed two decades, and by the time he left, the University needed to change its style of leadership.</span></p> <p><span>\"After 20 years of Bok, it was time for something different,\" Armstrong says.</span></p> <p><span>But since Rudenstine's tenure only lasted a decade, the next change between leaders may not be as dramatic.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's not as much of a divergence from the past decade,\" she says.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>The Names </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Rudenstine is a humanist. The focus this time, however, will likely be on a different area. No one expects another English Renaissance scholar. Thus far, the pool of proposed candidates includes people with scientific, legal and business backgrounds--pragmatic fields for a pragmatic University.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>While Clark and Fineberg have already drawn attention as internal favorites, a number of external possibilities with strong Harvard ties have also piqued interest.</span></p> <p><span>The Dean of Stanford Law School, Kathleen M. Sullivan--a graduate of and former faculty member at Harvard Law School--is one of the country's top constitutional law experts. She is enormously popular among those who emphasize the inclusion of women as presidential possibilities--and she is Stanford's first female academic dean.</span></p> <p><span>Most important: her ties to Harvard remain strong. She was here recently to deliver the first in a series of inaugural lectures honoring the new Radcliffe Institute. Fineberg introduced her in glowing terms; she was spotted chatting with Rudenstine.</span></p> <p><span>But Sullivan only became the dean of Stanford Law School in 1999--leading some to question whether she could leave her job. Born in 1945, she is in fact young enough to wait another decade for the next Harvard presidential search.</span></p> <p><span><b></b>Frequently mentioned as a Supreme Court nominee, she may be better suited for the bench than for Mass. Hall<b>. </b></span></p> <p><span>A person who has served as an Overseer and knows Sullivan personally says, \"She's marvelous... but I'm not sure she wouldn't be miscast. I'm not sure it's the right use for her extraordinary skills.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nobel Laureate Harold E. Varmus--who did graduate work in English at Harvard--has also been mentioned frequently. Formerly the director of the National Institutes of Health, Varmus moved to head the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York at the beginning of this year, prompting some to suggest that he also cannot switch jobs again so quickly.</span></p> <p><span>Others suggest that the Harvard presidency's virtually unrivaled bully pulpit could pull Sullivan, Varmus and other candidates away from previous engagements.</span></p> <p><span>While the majority of the candidates will come directly from academia, Harvard affiliates in Washington have an interest in the Mass. Hall office as well. A Washington source with University ties says that Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers--who was a Harvard economics professor from 1983 to 1993--will doubtless show up on the Corporation's roster of desirables.</span></p> <p><span>\"He is the obvious name to think about in the world of Washington,\" the source says. \"He has shown himself to be a surprisingly strong administrator as Secretary of the Treasury.\"</span></p> <p><span>Summers is not the only Washington bigwig to be named. But this presidential search is also unusual in that it coincides with another: the nation's. Many of those who might be considered do not know if they will be out of work or newly appointed come January.</span></p> <p><span>One such possibility: Condoleezza Rice, formerly Stanford's provost and currently Texas Gov. George W. Bush's foreign policy adviser. One of a small pool of minority administrators in academia, she has taken a year off from Stanford to assist the presumptive Republican nominee for the presidency. But she lacks one crucial factor: a Harvard connection.</span></p> <p><span>\"When we've got so many distinguished Harvard alumni and faculty, we don't need to go outside the family,\" Armstrong says. \"These days, it would be an advantage with the issues being so complex to have someone who could hit the ground running.\"</span></p> <p><span>Armstrong adds that some of the University's momentum can be lost to a president with a learning curve.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, Rice is now closely associated with a conservative campaign--and Harvard is a notoriously liberal institution.</span></p> <p><span><b></b>Conventional search wisdom suggests that the Corporation will be on the prowl for people with strong University ties, in their mid-40s to early 50s--people who, like Rudenstine, have the potential to spend a decade on the job<b>. </b></span></p> <p><span>Many of the other possibilities suggested--Dean of the Harvard Medical School (HMS) Joseph B. Martin, Duke University President Nannerl O. Keohane and Columbia University President George Rupp--are past that conventional age limit.</span></p> <p><span>However, if the Corporation were enthusiastic enough about any of these candidates, it might be possible to ignore any concerns about age.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, the average term of the university president is getting shorter. Slichter suggests that the next president may not stay even a decade.</span></p> <p><span>\"A president's decision has to do with what he wants to do and what he's done,\" Slichter says. \"The next natural break point might be five years from now. It's a killing job.\"</span></p> <p><span>Experts note that in recent years, university presidential searches have turned more and more to the presidents of other universities.</span></p> <p><span>According to Madeleine F. Green '67, vice president of the American Council on Education, in 1998 about 20 percent of university presidents had already held the top post at another university. At private research universities like Harvard, that number inches closer to 30 percent, she says.</span></p> <p><span>She hypothesizes that this is because universities are no longer as willing to take risks on candidates with less experience.</span></p> <p><span>And Rudenstine thinks this trend of looking to other universities' leaders is unfortunate.</span></p> <p><span>\"If institutions can to some extent find leadership from within themselves, it means it's a person who's most likely to know a fair amount about how the institution works, what it's goals are what its idiosyncrasies are,\" Rudenstine says. \"If the institution's in good shape then you may well do well to have someone who knows that to start with. I believe quite a bit in institutional loyalty.\"</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Mean What You Say </b><p> </p><p></p></font>If institutional loyalty is a prerequisite, then it seems Fineberg has it in spades.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>He's got four degrees from Harvard--a bachelor's, a master's, a medical degree and a doctorate.<b> </b>As an undergraduate, he lived in Lowell House and studied psychology.</span></p> <p><span>In his years as dean of SPH and as provost, he has developed quite a reputation. Asked to describe him, interviewees consistently came up with two adjectives: intelligent and articulate. Born in Pittsburgh in 1945, Fineberg is married to a fellow doctor.</span></p> <p><span>When asked the inevitable question, Fineberg dodges.</span></p> <p><span>\"It seems that your name would naturally be mentioned in the search for the next Harvard president.\"</span></p> <p><span>Silence.</span></p> <p><span>\"Are you interested?\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Let me put it this way,\" he says.  \"Anyone interested in making an impact on and through higher education would be interested in the Harvard presidency.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Now, if I applied transitive logic--you strike me as just such a person.  Would you characterize yourself as such a person?\"</span></p> <p><span>He laughs and hesitates.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think I'd like to stick with what I said.\"</span></p> <p><span>Fineberg is, for the most part<b>, </b>well respected within the Harvard administration. He is credited with focusing on information technology and using the interfaculty initiatives to draw the schools together. Both Vice President for Administration Sally H. Zeckhauser and Vice President for Finance Elizabeth C. \"Beppie\" Huidekoper say Fineberg has created his own niche.</span></p> <p><span>\"He has carved out his own things--his, not Neil's. That's clear now,\" Huidekoper says.</span></p> <p><span>\"He's taken a number of issues and made them his own,\" Zeckhauser adds.</span></p> <p><span>This is no small feat in a job that Fineberg himself defines as an extension of the presidency.</span></p> <p><span>The position, re-introduced by Rudenstine at the beginning of his tenure, is only nine years old--as Fineberg says, \"in Harvard time that's the flick of an eyelash\"--and holds dubious authority in some eyes.</span></p> <p><span>\"The provost position at Harvard is not a strong position, let's not kid ourselves,\" says Al Carnesale, the second of Rudenstine's three provosts and now the president of the University of California at Los Angeles. He compares it to the position of deputy president.</span></p> <p><span>The provost advises the president in most searches, helps administer the University's central bureaucracy. Fineberg is known for his work on interfaculty initiatives, as well as on information technology.</span></p> <p><span>But the provost does not have a final say in major University decisions. Does not sit as a member of the Harvard Corporation.  Does not sit as a member of the deans' council.  Does not appoint University deans.</span></p> <p><span>\"You are not going to be making the final decision. The buck never stops with you and as a result you are never sure if you are not going to be undermined...if you show your hand, that might be trumped by one of the deans or the president, where the buck does stop,\" the person who has served as an Overseer says.</span></p> <p><span>\"For someone like Provost Fineberg who was a dean and was accustomed to having the buck stop with him, that's tough,\" the person says.</span></p> <p><span>Rudenstine says that because Harvard is less centralized than other universities, the provost necessarily has less responsibility--as does the rest of the central administration.</span></p> <p><span>At other schools, he says, the provost might have jurisdiction over university funds, while at Harvard, most money matters are left up to individual deans.</span></p> <p><span>Because of this decentralization, one of the provost's main responsibilities is to do \"most of the thinking about the bridging together of the institution,\" Rudenstine says. This coordination between all deans is a project on which Rudenstine himself has put tremendous emphasis.</span></p> <p><span>It's no surprise, then, that Rudenstine's cushy corner office in Mass. Hall adjoins Fineberg's, connecting the two in an architectural layout that the provost calls \"symbolic.\"</span></p> <p><span>Neil Rudenstine's taller shadow, Fineberg is even-keeled and unflappable where his boss is disarmingly guileless. Fineberg is nothing if not deliberate. One colleague dubs this physician's demeanor \"bedside manner.\" To most central administrators, his controlled manner is admirable.</span></p> <p><span>But for some University officials, that manner, along with the loosely defined position of provost, renders him something of an enigma.</span></p> <p><span>\"He can't really show his hand because of the position he's in,\" says another person who has served as an Overseer, adding that when talking to Fineberg, one cannot always tell what he is thinking.</span></p> <p><span>But as one of the University's higher-ups, Fineberg is not always at liberty to say what everyone wants to hear, Huidekoper says.</span></p> <p><span>\"When you are in a position of administrative authority, your musings aloud can be mistaken for firm declarations of policy, so you have to be conscious of what you say. If I have felt a monitor on what I have expressed as provost, it is not from any political pressure, but from an effort to be accurate and to avoid misleading others. I have always felt free to express my views,\" Fineberg says in response.</span></p> <p><span>Colleagues describe Fineberg as unrelentingly principled and apolitical.<b> </b>And Huidekoper says she considers Fineberg a \"good communicator.\"</span></p> <p><span>As provost, he faces certain communication challenges. He works closely with Rudenstine and the central administration but must also have a good relationship with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS)--which comprises 40 percent of the University. These two are historically at odds.</span></p> <p><span>One point of contention has been Project ADAPT, the implementation of University-wide finance systems that was administered through Fineberg's office. The transition was particularly rough for FAS, and Fineberg wasn't able to smooth over all the ruffled feathers.</span></p> <p><span>And earlier this spring, a FAS committee on resources directly called for more communication from the central administration about University finances, saying that the last time a report on the central administration's finances was released was during Carnesale's tenure as provost. \tAccording to Huidekoper, the decision to issue another such report is Fineberg's responsibility.</span></p> <p><span><b></b>Some wonder if FAS tensions with the central administration could make Fineberg their victim. They think he might have a hard time becoming president without Faculty approval and support.</span></p> <p><span>Fineberg's handling of the Radcliffe negotiations is also a particular point of tension among Harvard affiliates. Although Rudenstine and then-Chairman of the Radcliffe Board of Trustees Nancy-Beth G. Sheerr '71 began merger negotiations, Fineberg and Radcliffe trustee Susan Wallach continued the talks when Rudenstine and Sheerr were stymied.</span></p> <p><span>In the months between the announcement that Harvard and Radcliffe would merge in April 1999 and the final paperwork in September 1999, Fineberg helped iron out the kinks. Some say Fineberg rushed to finish the job, conceding points that Harvard officials would have fought for longer.</span></p> <p><span><b></b>One such instance: the merger states that Harvard cannot solicit funds from Radcliffe alumni who graduated earlier than 1977--that the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study should have the exclusive right to solicit those women.</span></p> <p><span>\"Those women were adamant,\" says the first person who has served as an Overseer. \"It threatened to be a deal breaker and Harvard just wasn't willing to have the negotiations collapse over the point when everything else was in place.\"</span></p> <p><span>To commemorate the final meeting of the Radcliffe College Board of Trustees in late September, Fineberg and Dean of FAS Jeremy R. Knowles donned frocks and sang from Gilbert and Sullivan.</span></p> <p><span><b></b>But not everything after the merger was song and dance.</span></p> <p><span><b></b>\"Some of the women I've talked to have taken Radcliffe out of their wills now because they were interested in undergraduate education for Radcliffe,\" the Overseer says.</span></p> <p><span>But the Overseer credits Fineberg for \"consensus-building skills.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Certainly in the Radcliffe negotiations, you just have to hand it to the man. It's like sailing--you can't go in a straight line. You have to tack,\" the Overseer says.</span></p> <p><span>Fineberg knows the Harvard turf better than anyone, and being a provost is considered good experience for a would-be president.</span></p> <p><span>\"He and Neil are joint bosses in my mind,\" Zeckhauser says.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, earlier this year, Stanford Provost John L. Hennessy was selected that university's 10th president--after officials strongly considered Fineberg.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Taking Care of Business </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Those unfamiliar with the University's inner workings might expect this search to be fairly simple--provost to president.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>But following Rudenstine's announcement, speculation focused on Clark, leaving Fineberg not directly in the limelight, but on its edge.</span></p> <p><span>In comparison to Fineberg with his University-wide role, Clark is an unknown commodity to much of the Harvard community. Ensconced in the carefully manicured campus across the river, he runs a school long known for its independence from the larger University.</span></p> <p><span>He is credited with changing that perception.</span></p> <p><span>\"He's been a very good citizen of the University,\" says Joan Hutchins, a former president of the Board of Overseers, speaking of Clark's performance as a dean. \"He has changed the whole notion of the business school throughout the University. The business school is being seen as having interest in working with the other schools and FAS.\"</span></p> <p><span>She cites as an example the recently launched doctorate degree in information technology, offered jointly by the Department of Engineering and Applied Sciences and HBS.</span></p> <p><span><b></b>But for some, Clark too raises a concern with FAS; they say that without Faculty approval, it could be difficult for him to become president. For FAS, traditionally the University's center of pure scholarship and academia, a president from the business school--with business sensibilities and motivations--might be a bitter pill to swallow.</span></p> <p><span>Clark, 51 and father of seven, is particularly noted for his progressive--and aggressive--approach to technology, a real step for a school that was sometimes stodgy about change. He is known for hacking away at red tape--he is a believer in decentralization, not only between the center and the faculties but between the faculties and their departments. He is known for dispensing with time-sucking bureaucracy, like task forces and committees.</span></p> <p><span>The Baker Professor of Administration, Clark grew up in Washington State and Utah, and is one Harvard degree shy of matching Fineberg. He has a bachelor's, master's and doctorate in economics--all from Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Immediately after obtaining his Ph.D, he joined the Harvard faculty. He hasn't looked back since. In 1990, he began overseeing the school's technology and operations management.</span></p> <p><span>At the Internet &amp; Society 2000 conference, Clark delivered an opening address in which he spoke about his views on technology.</span></p> <p><span>\"I believe that one of the biggest effects of the Internet era will be the creations of new kinds of institutions that will allow us to pursue [higher education],\" Clark said the remarks.</span></p> <p><span>Such remarks are in keeping with Clark's reputation for taking business risks--and could make for an interesting University approach to technology should he become president.</span></p> <p><span>Clark also spoke about the value of private gain versus social gain--not something one might expect from a businessperson, he noted.</span></p> <p><span>He became the business school's eighth dean in fall of 1995. Shortly after his appointment, he brought e-mail to HBS for the first time.</span></p> <p><span>He was said to have beaten out 50 others--including some from outside Harvard--for the spot. At the beginning of his tenure, the school had just switched from a semester system to a year-round structure and was changing its M.B.A. program.</span></p> <p><span><b></b>Now snowy-haired and a shade under six feet, he is not unlike Fineberg in his manner of speaking. He comes across as deliberately conversational, smooth and well paced. He gestures widely. A sense of humor is apparent. He is polished and expressive.</span></p> <p><span>Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, Clark is the eldest son of a devout Mormon family, and is a former Eagle Scout.</span></p> <p><span>He came to Harvard the fall after Fineberg graduated, intending to take pre-med courses. But struck with homesickness, he left after his first year to spend two years in Germany fulfilling his missionary obligation to the church.</span></p> <p><span>When he returned, he went not to Harvard, but to Brigham Young University, where he met and married his wife.

Ridge '67 has been a fish out of water for most of his life.</span></p> <p><span>First as a blue-collar, non-Kennedy Catholic at Harvard; then as an enlisted soldier-law student in Vietnam; as a Republican Congressman from a mostly Democratic district and finally as a Republican governor in a mostly Democratic state.</span></p> <p><span>And now, his name is mentioned in the sweepstakes for one of the most powerful positions in the United States--vice president--as an unabashedly pro-choice politician in a pro-life political party.</span></p> <p><span>Ridge was born into a working class family from Erie, Pennsylvania. His mother was a ward committee member and a die-hard Republican. His father was a meat salesman and a staunch Democrat.</span></p> <p><span>It was at home where Ridge was introduced to the political life and where he learned the art of moderation.</span></p> <p><span>Family dinners introduced young Tom to impassioned political debate.</span></p> <p><span>\"The table was the center of the house. It's where Tom learned that no one has a stranglehold on good ideas,\" the governor's younger brother David told the Allentown Morning Call. As for his parent's divergent politics, David says, \"Tom took a lot from both of them.\"</span></p> <p><span>As their father worked extra hours selling shoes to send the children to parochial school, young Tom distinguished himself enough in high school to get accepted to Harvard with a need-based scholarship in 1963.</span></p> <p><span>Cambridge, Mass  would become Ridge's political proving ground.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard in the 1960s was consumed by radical liberalism, the result of the extension of the civil rights movement and protests against the Vietnam War. There was also the opposition, many members of which scoffed at the demonstrators' pretensions and lamented their anti-patriotism.</span></p> <p><span>Between the two poles was a sizeable flotilla of moderate leftists, including intellectual students like the future Vice President Al Gore '69 who sympathized with the demonstrators but stayed in the dorm during protests.</span></p> <p><span>An 18-year-old Ridge, too, kept himself above the fray.</span></p> <p><span>He threw himself into sports, playing baseball, basketball and football his first year. He was also a member of the Crimson Key Society and of a philanthropic group known as Combined Charities, of which he served as House chair during his junior year.</span></p> <p><span>He concentrated in government but he eschewed the \"gov jock\" stereotype that was pervasive even in the '60s.</span></p> <p><span>\"[Ridge] was a very normal guy, not someone who you could easily categorize as a jock or preppy or anything like that,\" says Quincy House contemporary Frank A. Orban III '66.</span></p> <p><span>\" He was very studious, quiet--really a very typical guy.\"</span></p> <p><span>When he wasn't studying or sporting, Ridge was politicking--but locally.</span></p> <p><span>As a first-year, Ridge was a low-key member of the Freshmen Council.</span></p> <p><span>\"He was not a controversial member [of the council] at a time when it was very easy to be one,\" says fellow student leader Richard C. Haskins '67. \"He was certainly not one of those standing up on tables shouting down the administration.\"</span></p> <p><span>Ridge continued his political activities into his upperclass years in Quincy House. At the time, the House had a more traditional character, with many of its residents playing sports and participating in political</span></p> <p><span>events.</span></p> <p><span>Ridge fit in, joining the Quincy House Committee, where he served as secretary his senior year.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, he joined the Undergraduate Council from Quincy.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>From Pennsylvania to Peril </b><p> </p><p></p></font>The Vietnam War, kept at the forefront of most undergraduates' minds, leapt into consciousness for Ridge when he was drafted into the Army a year after graduation.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Serving as a staff sergeant from 1969 to 1970, Ridge was recognized for bravery, awarded the Bronze Star for Valor, the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry and the Combat Infantry Badge.</span></p> <p><span>When he was discharged, he went on to earn a law degree and opened a practice in Pennsylvania.</span></p> <p><span>In 1982, then an established prosecutor, Ridge decided to run for Congress.</span></p> <p><span>Ridge was the first enlisted man who saw combat in Vietnam to be elected to the U.S. House. Though eager to use the war experience as leverage in his campaign, Ridge was less keen on highlighting his Harvard ties.</span></p> <p><span>He won, as a moderate Republican in a working-class Democratic district.</span></p> <p><span>In the House, Ridge supported minimum-wage laws, voted to cut national defense spending, and, most relevant to his vice presidential aspirations, consistently supported a women's right to an abortion.\tAccording to the Congressional Quarterly, an influential Washington weekly magazine, Ridge voted with President Reagan only 40 percent of the time.</span></p> <p><span>Ridge was extremely popular in his district, winning re-election by large margins in 1990 and 1992. In 1994, Ridge was persuaded to run for Governor by state Republicans who were desperate to win the state's top office.</span></p> <p><span>Swept along in the wave of the Republican Revolution, he won easily.</span></p> <p><span>Ridge's popularity among Democrats and Republicans, his easiness with the media and his down-to-earth demeanor made him a national figure in the party. As a Catholic pro-choice governor of a northern state, Ridge, it was assumed, could help candidates gather key votes in Middle America's swing states--even those that were traditional Democratic strongholds.</span></p> <p><span>In 1996, according to published reports, then Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) asked Ridge to be his running mate. Ridge declined.</span></p> <p><span>Fast forward to 2000.</span></p> <p><span>Ridge's name has been bandied about by the political cognoscenti for months. Moderates in the party have floated the idea of a Bush-Ridge ticket, hoping to convince conservatives that Ridge could lure Reagan Republicans back to the party.</span></p> <p><span>To liberals, Ridge's background may seem like an excellent complement to Bush's.</span></p> <p><span>While both attended Ivy League schools, Ridge earned scholarships to attend Harvard and worked summers as a construction worker to make tuition.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike Bush's less-than-stellar record at Yale, Ridge earned honors in government here and was known as a serious student. Ridge was also highly decorated in Vietnam, while Bush served in the Texas National Guard, far from military action.</span></p> <p><span>Bush will choose his running-mate sometime before late July's Republican convention in Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span>Though his name has been mentioned the most often of those angling for Bush's vice presidential spot, party conservatives have declared Ridge an unacceptable choice.</span></p> <p><span>The two most influential organs of Republican opinion, the neo-conservative Weekly Standard and the traditionalist National Review, have prominently fronted articles labeling Ridge, in effect, a liberal Democrat in liberal Republican's clothing.</span></p> <p><span>The National Review's writers have written that Ridge would alienate conservative Catholics. They note that, because of Ridge's avowed pro-choice positions, his own bishop refuses to let him attend church functions. Ridge's problem is that of John F. Kennedy's '40 in reverse--he is not Catholic enough.</span></p> <p><span>But presidential campaigns move in cycles. Come July, the dynamics of Republican politics could well have changed.</span></p> <p><span>So almost no one, including party conservatives, has written off Ridge's chances.</span></p> <p><span>Gov. Bush visited Pennsylvania a few times during the primaries, staying at the Governor's mansion after several fundraising events.</span></p> <p><span>According to The New York Times, Ridge and Bush were bunking at the governor's mansion in Harrisburg, Pa., watching televised sports and catching up on old times.</span></p> <p><span>\"He's been a friend of mine for a long time,\" Bush said of Ridge.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's a heck of a ride,\" Ridge told the Times.  \"I've already got a great job, and I'm going to help my old friend George Bush get elected president.  And you know? I think he can carry Pennsylvania without me.\"</span></p> <p><span>Ridge declined to be interviewed for this article through his press secretary, Time Reeves.</span></p> <p><span>\"Since the press has picked up on the vice presidential thing, we have been deluged with requests for interviews,\" Reeves says.</span></p>"}

Receiving tenure at the most prestigious university in the country used to be the pinnacle of a career in academia.</span></p> <p><span>But professors like Arthur R. Miller and Michael J. Sandel are still out to conquer the rest of the academic world.</span></p> <p><span>Sandel--who has recorded his lectures for release to the public--and Miller, who attempted to release his lectures online, are testing the University's revised policies to monitor faculty members' for-profit or for-prestige activities.</span></p> <p><span>\"The more like a regular course an activity is, the less likely it is to be permitted,\" says Associate Provost Dennis F. Thompson, the chair of the Faculty Committee on Outside Activity. \"But obviously there are going to be some gray areas.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Internet explosion has made the gray areas more gray.</span></p> <p><span>Rule-bending--and in some cases rule-breaking--has become the norm for several professors.</span></p> <p><span>But faculty argue that promoting their research by writing books and lecturing is their job, and that their value to the faculty is as a researcher and a writer, as well as a teacher.</span></p> <p><span>\"Publication is a traditional part of what professors do,\" says Professor of Afro-American Studies and Philosophy K. Anthony Appiah. \"The main thing is that you have to be able to meet your responsibilities as a teacher.\"</span></p> <p><span>But professors' conceptions of these responsibilities have changed. And the University fears that professors who want to promote themselves outside Harvard are often forced to compromise their allegiance to their students in favor of their public image.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>The Rules </b><p> </p><p></p></font>According to current University regulations, professors can spend, at most, 20 percent of their effort as a faculty member on outside activities--whether it be on guest lecturing, writing or public appearances.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Although each Harvard school interprets the standard differently--Harvard Law School counts hours, the Kennedy School of Government counts days and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) counts effort--the principle is the same.</span></p> <p><span>According to Thompson, there are very few faculty members who violate the time constraint. And so the University's recent move to clarify its rules has left many wondering why a crackdown is necessary at all.</span></p> <p><span>Calling them preventive measures, Thompson says the ease of Internet access and problems at other universities provided the impetus behind Harvard's new guidelines.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think that is one of the reasons we wanted to clarify the</span></p> <p><span>rules--so that everyone can better understand how the old principles apply to the new technologies,\" hompson says.</span></p> <p><span>The University has set up a process to decide case by case what is permissible, but the lines are tough to draw.</span></p> <p><span>\"It may be O.K. to present a few lectures on the Internet or to put some of your course materials on the Internet,\" Thompson says. \"It is not okay to offer your Harvard courses at an online university.\"</span></p> <p><span>Director of the Harvard University Library and Pforzheimer University Professor Sidney Verba '53 says the University's guidelines give professors enough time to complete their required tasks.</span></p> <p><span>\"The regulations are a balance between what you owe to the University as a professor and the kind of flexibility that faculty need to carry out obligations to their professional lives,\" says Verba, who is also a member of the committee on outside activity.</span></p> <p><span>FAS Dean for Research and Information Technology Paul C. Martin says he thinks Harvard has a well-established set of rules and policies.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is the one place that professors are supposed to do their face-to-face teaching.

The issue, say FAS officials, is  whether outside activities themselves can be considered ethical.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b></b></font>University administrators are concerned that if professors make the content of their lectures availible to the general public, the 'exclusive' Harvard education that students should be receiving may be compromised.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Harvard name has been built up over centuries...and one must worry about the quality of anything that has the name attached to it,\" says Dean of the Faculty Jeremy R. Knowles.</span></p> <p><span>Thompson says the University's policy should make it impermissible for a Harvard faculty member to try to teach somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span>\"Harvard students come expecting a distinctively Harvard education and we have an obligation to provide an experience here that we don't provide to the rest of the world,\" Thompson says. \"If you are a full time Harvard faculty member, you should not be devoting your time to Yale.\"</span></p> <p><span>But the question of whether 'teaching' also includes virtual teaching is one that is still unanswered.</span></p> <p><span>But some argue that the point is moot because nothing--even videotaped lectures--is the same as an actual course at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>\"Distance learning is no substitute for the real thing,\" says Professor of Government Michael J. Sandel.</span></p> <p><span>Sandel, who videotaped several lectures in a private studio for an educational company, says he does not intend for the lectures to serve as a full course, and that they are aimed at a completely different audience.</span></p> <p><span>He says, however, that he would never put lectures on the Internet for fear that students would watch them as an alternative to coming to class and getting the interactive experience that they need in order to learn.</span></p> <p><span>Williston Professor of Law Robert H. Mnookin '64, who was also a member of the committee on outside activity, says the lines are fuzzy.</span></p> <p><span>\"What the Internet has done is that it has blurred the distinction between books that are used for instructional purposes and those that aren't.\"</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Balancing Act or Violation? </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Professors who sell their lectures or have produced popular books argue that they always put their students first.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Elaine Kamarck, a lecturer at the</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy School of Government and a top policy adviser to presidential candidate Al Gore '69, says that there is always a way to fit in outside activities.

He too emphasizes the fact that there is nothing that can substitute for a student's actually taking a class.</span></p> <p><span>\"Lectures are not all that a class consists of. Since many students don't go to lectures in a course, students clearly recognize that too,\" Appiah says.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Double Dipping </b><p> </p><p></p></font>But time is not always the problem when evaluating a professor's conflict of interest.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>A concern that has arisen for professors who cater to two different audiences--both their students in lecture and the mass public over the airwaves--is that they will favor the audience that helps them earn the most money.</span></p> <p><span>When professors target their lectures towards the public as opposed to Harvard students, students may suffer.</span></p> <p><span>\"If you design the course with two different audiences in mind--for students in a Harvard classroom and users on the net--the question is raised which one you are focusing on,\" Thomson says.</span></p> <p><span>Bromley Professor of Law Arthur R. Miller at Harvard Law School is one professor who has encountered such a problem.</span></p> <p><span>Miller says the University's new restriction on putting lectures online can inhibit a professor's desire to enrich the intellectual community at large.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is a radical change in policy that restricts our freedom,\" Miller told The Crimson after the draft of Harvard's new policy was released.</span></p> <p><span>But the concept of Internet education is one that has long been questioned.</span></p> <p><span>\"When I am preparing a course for the Internet, it may or may not be the best thing for my own students,\" Thompson says. \"I might be tempted to redesign my course to make it more suitable for the net than for my classroom.\"</span></p> <p><span>Even Kamarck says that when she was juggling her public career with her job as a professor, there was an inevitable amount of convergence.</span></p> <p><span>\"If you are teaching government and working in a presidential campaign, there is bound to be substantial overlap,\" she says. \"There are definitely things that I work on in the campaign that I end up using in class.\"</span></p> <p><span>Verba says that sometimes it is hard to recognize when a professor is compromising his or her students--and that is the ultimate issue.</span></p> <p><span>\"We all write books which sometimes are based on courses and that is not usually considered a conflict of interest,\" he says. \"But if you videotape your course and sell it through a commercial university, then  that is really in competition with what you owe Harvard.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Rise and Fall of the Houses | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The House system--in which students in the College spend all but their first year in one of 12 small residential clusters--was at its peak during the 1950s and 1960s. It was then that House masters loomed large in undergraduate life, then that social activity on campus began with House sports. It was then that a House assignment carried its most meaning.In the decades that followed, Harvard undergraduates grappled with issues that defied the confines of House life--the Vietnam War principally, and the increasing diversity of student interests which left the Houses less equipped to bring students together in unified activities.</span></p> <p><span>The system created in 1930 by Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, had as its aims certain ideas of community that have always cut against the grain of Harvard life. In the face of social upheaval, the system that had seemed so stable in the years after the Second World War began to come apart, long before Harry R. Lewis '68 came along.<font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><p><b>Genesis: 1929 </b></p><p> </p></font>Until 1869, when Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, became president of Harvard, the University was only a college. Eliot, however, wanted to turn the school he presided over into more than an undergraduate institution--he wanted it to offer the full range of professional training in schools that require a bachelor's degree for admittance, from a law school to a medical school to a business school. The College was given over to his system of \"free electives\" that basically allowed students to take any classes they wanted. They had total freedom from College curricular authority, as Eliot wanted it, and total responsibility for their own education.</span></p> <p><b>Genesis: 1929 </b></p> <p> </p> <p><span><b>Genesis: 1929 </b></span></p> <p><span>Moreover, as College housing in Harvard Yard deteriorated--Yard dorms had no central heating or plumbing until the turn-of-the-century--Eliot allowed his students to live wherever they pleased, as was the practice in the European universities he was trying to imitate. By keeping the University out of the undergraduate housing business, Eliot could spend Harvard's money on projects that he felt were more pressing to its academic mission.</span></p> <p><span>Soon, the so-called \"Gold Coast,\" sprung up, a row of expensive and ritzy apartment buildings along Mt. Auburn Street, where Harvard's wealthy undergraduates could rent rooms. Buildings like Claverly Hall and Apley Court sported everything from squash courts and swimming pools to steam heat and elevators. For food, Gold Coast residents simply walked down the street to their social clubs, which offered some of the best cuisine in Cambridge. At the same time, public transportation was reaching new areas of the city. Boston and Cambridge were united by a modern and efficient trolley system, and soon it was difficult to convince students of modest means that they should live in Harvard's bedraggled dorms when the prospect of cheaper rooms off-campus presented itself.</span></p> <p><span>The result was fragmentation and a hierarchy based on social class such that only 27 percent of Harvard students lived on campus by 1900. It was the antithesis of the kind of College life envisioned by Lowell, who took over for Eliot when his 40-year presidency ended in 1909. \"We must construct a new solidarity to replace that which is gone,\" Lowell declared in his first year at the University's helm. Lowell's project became one of unifying the College and of providing equity--rather than freedom--to his undergraduates.As his successor Neil L. Rudenstine was to do in Allston half a century later, Lowell set to secretly buying plots of land surrounding the University. The territory between Mt. Auburn Street and the Charles River was, in Lowell's day, an unpropitious site, home to a few modest houses, a series of wharves and coalhouses, a power plant and a malodorous bank of mudflats.</span></p> <p><span>Benefactor Edward Waldo Forbes, who would one day become curator of Harvard's Fogg Museum, formed a secret holding company called Riverside Associates that bought for Harvard nearly all of the land that was to be known as \"South Yard.\" In an effort to reverse the trend toward living off-campus, Lowell commissioned four dorms for first-year students on the newly-acquired lands: Gore, Standish, McKinlock and Smith Halls. Ground was broken in 1914. With the eruption of the First World War, the Gold Coast apartments suddenly became unprofitable to manage. Harvard immediately bought them and had no difficulty filling its newly-built river residences.</span></p> <p><span>Another 15 years would pass before Lowell could initiate his grandest housing scheme ever. In the late 1920s, oil magnate and Yale alum Edward S. Harkness became frustrated with the endless deliberations of his alma mater over what to do with his money. He turned to Harvard. In a few quick conversations with Lowell, Harkness became convinced that he had found a man of action and a man of vision. In 1929, he agreed to donate what became a $13 million gift to Harvard, funding a system of 300-person residences that would house Harvard's upperclass students. Four had essentially already been built. Smith Hall became Kirkland House, the Gold Coast apartment buildings of Randolph and Westmorly became Adams, Gore and Standish combined to become Winthrop House, and McKinlock, along with Mather Hall (now Old Quincy) became Leverett. By 1931, Dunster, Lowell and Eliot Houses had been built and Harvard had established its original seven Houses.<font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><p><b>Original Intentions </b></p><p> </p></font>The Houses were designed to give the College a new form of control over students by involving the educational institution in social life. The giant College was to be broken up into seven smaller communities of a few hundred. Lowell was part of a generation of social scientists, reformers who believed in progress and the possibility for educated social engineering, and he saw Harvard as an opportunity to put his ideas in action. Eliot's laissez-faire approach to College living was immediately discarded. The House system would give Harvard the means to influence more fully the lives of its students.</span></p> <p><b>Original Intentions </b></p> <p> </p> <p><span><b>Original Intentions </b></span></p> <p><span>First, it would promote the American virtue of equality. No longer would the rich live in posh apartments while the poor rubbed their hands together for warmth in the Yard. The Houses would be \"national and democratic,\" Lowell explained. Within each House, for example, large and spacious rooms, presumably to be occupied by wealthy students, were placed next to small ones in order to force the interaction that wouldn't take place if rich students were permitted to isolate themselves. Second, the Houses were to be representative. Lowell called them \"a microcosm of the University,\" implying that they would each serve as cross-sections of the diversity of life in the College as a whole. Finally, they were to be social above all else. Their value, particularly as a vehicle for equality, was in the interaction they would foster between different students who would otherwise have no contact with one another outside of classes.</span></p> <p><span>Lowell, however, held rather contradictory views, and his \"democratic\" vision was in many ways qualified. He believed that certain conditions were necessary for Houses to work the way he wanted them to. Though they were to cut away at Gold Coast elitism, Lowell's Houses nonetheless charged higher rents for larger rooms. Poor students got what they paid for, while the wealthy often paid twice their rent for more luxurious digs. Moreover, Lowell's equality did not apply to all. Notoriously, he forbade blacks from living in Harvard housing because, he said, it would upset Southern whites and thereby undermine the cohesiveness he sought. For similar reasons, he struggled to cap Harvard's Jewish contingent, installing quotas that dramatically restricted the enrollment of Jews at the College.</span></p> <p><span>Despite strenuous objection from Eliot and from alumni, Lowell held to his policies, arguing that his community vision required certain common backgrounds of its members. And though he argued the Houses should represent the University as a whole, he strongly opposed a system along the lines of today's randomization. House choice must absolutely be \"voluntary,\" he asserted, because undergraduates wouldn't feel the same strong allegiance to a House they were forced to join as they would to one that they picked. Without that sense of loyalty, the willingness to partake in a shared life would vanish and the students would again be thrust into the utter individualism of the Eliot years.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, though Lowell saw the social side of living together as the driving force that would turn Houses into homes, he nonetheless wanted to mix a strong academic component into the House experience. The Houses were to afford students a chance at \"self-education,\" the opportunity to learn from one another outside of class. Distinguished professorial masters were to serve as the focus of each House and tutors were to infiltrate student ranks.</span></p> <p><span>Taking his cues from Cambridge and Oxford, Lowell devised a \"tutorial\" system that would pair undergraduates with a scholar from their field of study. That tutor would live in the House and, for three years, instruct the young student in his discipline in preparation for oral exams at the end of the senior year. \"The relation between the mature scholar and the student will be made less remote,\" he explained. The Houses would thereby be much more than the communities in which students at the College lived; they were to be the lynchpin of Harvard's academic program.</span></p> <p><span>The cross-purposes built into Lowell's plan actually highlight the importance he wanted the Houses to have for Harvard students. Though some alumni and students--partisans of final clubs, in large part--objected to Lowell's attempt to gain control of students' lives beyond the lecture hall, his plan met with immediate success. In their first year, all of the Houses were booked full.<font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><p><b>In Their Prime </b></p><p> </p></font>Twenty years later, Lowell's Houses were thriving. In some ways, they didn't quite reflect his original intentions, but as colleges within the College, the Houses were creating smaller divisions that undergraduates could call their own.</span></p> <p><b>In Their Prime </b></p> <p> </p> <p><span><b>In Their Prime </b></span></p> <p><span>Life was in many ways uniform from House to House. They all held annual dinners, which were attended by the president of the University, and they all celebrated athletics. They vied for the same little luxuries: a pool table, a dark room, a formal dance in the spring. And they worked to make their members feel that they were part of something significant. Nearly 200 Leverett House residents, for example, turned out to watch their team in the inter-House football championship in the early 1950s. Leverett was invigorated, fresh off its attempt to claim Gore Hall from Winthrop House in the celebrated \"Gore War.\" Students recorded their pleasure at having tutors in the Houses, known to invite undergraduates into their suites for \"sherry parties.\" The College held a different attitude toward alcohol then, using it to enliven the undergraduate experience: The Houses themselves served beer readily at House parties and Christmas dinners.</span></p> <p><span>Houses were selective, with first-year students interviewing at their top choices to see which House would take them. The Houses in turn unified behind advertising campaigns in attempts to win popularity among undergraduates, which inevitably emphasized the differences between them. \"The Houses ought not to try for distinctive reputations,\" argued Winthrop Master Ronald M. Ferry, \"but they'll naturally come by them.\"</span></p> <p><span>Despite the fundamental similarities in the way students lived their lives, the Houses did acquire their own idiosyncrasies. Adams House attracted would-be gourmets with its superior cuisine and was generally more artistically inclined than its neighbors. It sponsored, for example, its own glee club, arts society and exhibitions of drawings by the University president, all while fielding the worst House athletic teams at Harvard. Football players flocked to Winthrop House, where House spirit was less strong than elsewhere, perhaps because most of those who might ordinarily join the House football team were already on the College team. Lowell attracted studious, tradition-minded students who were impressed by formal dinners at the House's High Table. And Eliot appealed to \"humanities-steeped club men,\" as the starting place for a majority of the University's Rhodes Scholars and Phi Beta Kappas, all \"awash in Canadian Club.\" The student government urged the Houses to be understood in terms of</span></p> <p><span>personalities,\" rather than \"stereotypes.\" There was no single model for a Lowellite or Adamsian, and the profiles of the Houses were too quirky to be so limited. \"The labels that are hung on each of the Houses are, everyone knows, more poetry than truth,\" according to the yearbook. Any student, its authors wrote, could be equally happy in any House.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, the greatest disparity between the Houses seems to have been between the kinds of leadership in its most important position, the House master. Eliot Professor of Greek Literature John H. Finley Jr. 25 provided the most notable model over the course of his 26-years at the helm of Eliot House. In a given year, Finley attended every Eliot football game, ate at least one meal in the House dining hall every day, played a part in the Eliot Christmas play, chatted with students every week at tea served in his home and memorized the name of every incoming Eliot sophomore by the end of September.</span></p> <p><span>The House system was not without its problems. From the start, Lowell's tutorial program seemed to founder, prompting a Student Council report in 1959 that lamented a lack of interaction between students and faculty. Lowell's vision of the House as an academic locus gave way to his notion of the House as the center of social interaction. As all the students of the College settled in to live and play football together, it was entirely the social dimension that cut away at the elitism of class Lowell deplored. More memorably, in the eyes of Harvard students at least, the Houses through the 1950s and 1960s served as a place that counteracted against the anonymity of life at a large research university, providing a place that was, often, familiar, youthful and comfortable. <font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><p><b>Decline and Fall </b></p><p> </p></font>The success of the House in the post-War decades did not come to an end because of randomization. Its erosion had been taking place for years, the result of social changes at the College that were in many ways incompatible with the way the Houses had functioned.</span></p> <p><b>Decline and Fall </b></p> <p> </p> <p><span><b>Decline and Fall </b></span></p> <p><span>Lowell's move to restrict Jewish admissions was based on the idea that it is harder to build a tightly-knit community from a body of students with widely varying backgrounds and interests. Some difference was good, but equally important was common culture.</span></p> <p><span>Diversity, however, was knocking at Harvard's door. More and more, the College admitted students it previously would have turned away, and the elite day schools and prep schools that had supplied the College with students became a smaller and smaller source for admissions candidates. No longer did large groups of students who had known each other all the way through high school have the opportunity to live together.</span></p> <p><span>At the same time, the introspective nature of House life came under sharp attack during the student unrest of the late 1960s and 1970s. House football came to seem somehow unimportant compared to, say, the Vietnam War. To some extent, the Houses helped to cool student passions, but even in those Houses like Dunster that were home to many of the leading radicals on campus, a tension existed between the tenor of House life and the struggles taking place outside the confines of the undergraduate world. \"People might go out and parade and counter-parade and then come back and talk in the dining hall,\" Cabot Professor of English Literature and Eliot House Master Alan Heimert '49 opined years later.</span></p> <p><span>Two years after students evicted the Harvard administration and took over University Hall, the Houses went coed, folding in students from Radcliffe College and adding three Radcliffe Houses--Currier, North and South--to the undergraduate mix. Gone was the Mr. Chips-style paternalism that had been the model for a House master.</span></p> <p><span>Even as the Houses stopped interviewing potential residents, the Houses took on more distinct personalities. Diversity of Houses was one thing; diversity in the Houses was quite another. \"I do not believe that a community must have two of everything, like Noah's Ark,\" said former Adams House Master Robert J. Kiely in the days before random House assignments. Currier House became the choice of many of the College's minority students, who comprised about one-third of its population during the early 1990s, and the Houses moved more and more in their own directions. The Houses had less in common with one another, and the differences between them in many ways became too great for the benign rivalries of the earlier decades.</span></p> <p><span>Student interest also became more fractured, in a way that undercut the usefulness of the House. In the 1950s, the College was home to about 60 student groups. Today that figure is in the neighborhood of 300. And as students had less time for their Houses, so did masters. Leading scholars found it more and more difficult to set aside professional advancement in order to attend House plays, although some notable exceptions occurred.</span></p> <p><span>The College continued to grow in size, and the construction of Quincy House and Leverett Towers in 1958 and Mather House in 1971, has still not reduced House size to what Dean of the College Wilbur J. Bender 27 in 1950 deemed the appropriate cap: 300 residents. In larger Houses, students struggle to learn one another's names as a sea of housemates overwhelms them. And, of course, randomization hasn't helped. Though Lowell saw homogeneity as crucial for the success of his houses, Lewis' project of randomization is very much in the spirit of using undergraduate residences to engineer the social, and in some sense political, experiences of Harvard students.</span></p> <p><span>In its 1959 report, the Student Council condemned Yale's \"IBM system\" of random housing assignments as inimical to true community. Ironically, it didn't take the administration's IBM system to challenge communal college life. The House system took its strongest blow from students themselves, pushing for diverse interests and bored with the prospects of beer parties, holiday plays and football matches. Lowell's House system may well have been meant for another age, one in which students enjoyed the same basic pastimes and believed the same basic ideas.</span></p> <p><span>Today's system falls somewhere in between the Harvard culture of unmitigated individualism forged by Charles W. Eliot and the social prescriptives of A. Lawrence Lowell, providing little of Lowell's community and less of Eliot's freedom. But in the end, that change came from students.</span></p>"}

{"title": "The Names in the News | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>B. J. Averell '02</span></p> <p><span>Sophomore B. J. Averell can teach would-be activists a thing or two about standing up to The Man. In November he took on an international airline, a district attorney and several peeved security guards--and beat the system.</span></p> <p><span>Averell was trying to get home to Collingswood, N.J. for Thanksgiving when he showed up at Logan Airport on Nov. 24 for his flight to Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span>Averell says he arrived on time, but Delta Airlines ticket agents shunted him into different lines. By the time he made it to the gate, the flight had begun boarding standby passengers. Even though he had a ticket, Averell was denied a seat on the 6:15 p.m. flight. The agents told him they would try to get him on a standby flight--on Thanksgiving morning.</span></p> <p><span>Undeterred, he slipped behind a pillar, dodged the gate attendant, passed the barrier and walked down the ramp all but unnoticed. Averell hid in a bathroom on the plane, intending to find an empty seat later.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, another passenger spotted him. Flight attendants ejected him from the plane and delivered him to airport police, who handcuffed him on the tarmac. He was arrested for trespassing and disorderly conduct.</span></p> <p><span>Averell's daring tactics ignited a small media storm that was covered in papers and on television stations across the country. Back at Harvard, he found himself something of a celebrity.</span></p> <p><span>\"When I came back to school I was pretty much a bad-ass,\" Averell says. \"One guy came up to me at Tommy's and said, 'I read about your story. You live out our dreams for us, man.'\"</span></p> <p><span>Although confessing to the crimes would have only resulted in a small fine, Averell pled not guilty. In February, Delta and state prosecutors dropped the charges.</span></p> <p><span>Did his courtroom odyssey make him a role model for the oppressed everywhere? Averell is modest about his accomplishments.</span></p> <p><span>\"I was just fighting for the rights of the little man, my fellow college student,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>John A. Burton '01</span></p> <p><span>For a few weeks in February, the saga of Undergraduate Council Vice President John A. Burton '01 was better than Court TV. Burton's almost-impeachment and narrow redemption offered students the drama of a national political scandal amid the comforts of home.</span></p> <p><span>Burton and his presidential running mate Fentrice D. Driskell '01 were riding high after clobbering the competition in the December elections. Burton took 400 votes more than his closest opponent. Council watchers proclaimed that Driskell and Burton would reverse the conservatism of past presidents Noah Z. Seton '00 and Beth A. Stewart '00 and inaugurate a new era of liberal activism.</span></p> <p><span>That was until Buttongate. Shortly after the election, other candidates began muttering about alleged improprieties in the Driskell-Burton campaign--a mass mailing to first-years, inappropriately obtained lemonade.</span></p> <p><span>But a batch of buttons from the Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender and Supporters' Alliance (BGLTSA) proved the most damning issue. A box in the BGLTSA's resource center invited students to take buttons--but board members said they didn't expect Burton to take all of them, more than 100, and cover them over with the Driskell-Burton logo.</span></p> <p><span>Furious, 10 council members, including some defeated opponents of the Driskell campaign, filed articles of impeachment against Burton.</span></p> <p><span>Political intrigue swirled for weeks, as accusations flew and former Burton allies (including an ex-roommate) called for his resignation.</span></p> <p><span>National reporters were drawn to the scandal by its resemblance to the Clinton impeachment in miniature. The Boston Globe covered the vote, and Newsweek ran a feature.</span></p> <p><span>The council's vote on Feb. 13 was close. The first article of impeachment, accusing Burton of lying, failed to win a majority. The second, for infringing on the rights of a student group, carried 41 to 38 but did not achieve the necessary two-thirds majority to remove the vice president.</span></p> <p><span>When it was all over, the Burton trial tarnished the already blackened reputation of the council even further. More than a month of Driskell and Burton's term was consumed by jockeying and legal maneuvering.</span></p> <p><span>But at least students paid attention--the impeachment debates drew packed houses and spurred weeks of dining hall conversation. For a legislative body that's often ignored, there may not be such a thing as bad publicity.</span></p> <p><span>Lawrence Lessig</span></p> <p><span>When Thomas Penfield Jackson, the judge presiding over the Microsoft antitrust trial, wanted help sifting through the labyrinth of technical issues surrounding the case, he turned to Berkman Professor of Entrepreneurial Studies Lawrence Lessig. If Microsoft is broken up, as is widely expected, Lessig will have provided critical ammunition for the government's slingshot.</span></p> <p><span>Lessig, the author of <i>Code, and Other Laws of Cyberspace</i>, is one of the most prominent scholars in the fast-growing field of Internet law.</span></p> <p><span>Whereas many Internet pioneers tend to see cyberspace as inherently free, competitive and accessible, Lessig takes a darker view: democratic ideals won't automatically translate onto the Net. Corporations and government, he warns, could wind up controlling the infrastructure of the Internet unless they're actively checked.</span></p> <p><span>That anti-monopoly message understandably made Bill Gates, Class of 1977, and colleagues nervous. When Jackson initially tried to appoint Lessig a special master on the case, Microsoft objected vehemently.</span></p> <p><span>But Lessig had his say anyway. In a friend-of-the-court brief filed Feb. 1, he argued that Microsoft broke antitrust law by bundling Windows and Internet Explorer. Jackson leaned on Lessig's opinion in his landmark ruling against the company.</span></p> <p><span>Lessig's Microsoft brief made him famous, but he's not resting on his laurels. Last month he told The New York Times that the pending AOL-Time Warner merger makes him \"deeply, deeply pessimistic.\" Steve Case and Gerald Levin couldn't be blamed if they're feeling nervous.</span></p> <p><span>Although he says he loves Harvard Law School and its Berkman Center for Internet and Society, Lessig plans to leave for Stanford in the fall for family reasons. \"The loss is incalculable,\" one colleague said.</span></p> <p><span>Even in his brief tenure, Lessig has proven that professors who stay on top of surging changes in technology will prosper. As policymakers stumble through the Internet maze, they will increasingly turn to academics like Lessig to be their guides.</span></p> <p><span>K. Kyriell Muhammad</span></p> <p><span>As a House adviser for gay and lesbian issues, Mather resident tutor K. Kyriell Muhammad counseled students grappling with the effects of homophobia. A poster on his door proclaimed his room a \"BGLTS Safe Zone.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Muhammad himself left Harvard at the end of January after he was subject to sporadic anti-gay vandalism for a semester. His experience offered troubling proof that intolerance sometimes occurs even at famously liberal Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>The harassment started in late September, when a picture of Muhammad in a gown was removed from his door. Then he found homophobic graffiti on his message pad. Posters advertising the House's Queer Film Series were defaced and torn down. Some gay students in Winthrop House faced similar vandalism.</span></p> <p><span>The House responded with anger at the harassment and support for Muhammad. More than 300 Mather residents signed a pledge entitled \"We Live Here Together,\" and the House committee posted a declaration of tolerance in the dining hall. The masters and police pledged to track down the culprits.</span></p> <p><span>But Muhammad continued to be a target--he was awakened one night by the sound of a vandal battering against his door.</span></p> <p><span>In December, Muhammad announced he would resign his post and leave Harvard at the end of the semester.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's horrifying and shameful. People shouldn't have to leave their homes and jobs because of homophobic acts,\" said Michael K. T. Tan '01, co-chair of the Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender and Supporters' Alliance.</span></p> <p><span>Muhammad said he was heartened by students' vocal concern but decided staying on would consume him emotionally.</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't get paid to live here. I don't get paid to get harassed!\" he said. \"This was just an unacceptable living situation.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dora Gyorffy '01</span></p> <p><span>Many Harvard students reach new heights each year in their endeavors.</span></p> <p><span>For Dora Gyorffy '01, the phrase can be used literally.</span></p> <p><span>Over her three-year career on the Harvard track team, Gyorffy has excelled in both the high jump and triple jump. For the third straight time, she won the high jump and triple jump at this year's Indoor Heptagonals.</span></p> <p><span>But this year, Gyorffy's accomplishments were a step above those of previous seasons. This winter she tied the NCAA indoor high jump record of 1.97 meters--and only stopped because her shoe tore apart, preventing her from attempting to break the record.</span></p> <p><span>Just two weeks later she took the national indoor title with a jump of 1.94 meters and a week ago earned second place in the NCAA outdoor meet with a jump of 1.87 meters.</span></p> <p><span>Along with captain Brenda N. Taylor '01, who excelled in the 400 meters and several sprinting events this season, Gyorffy's efforts have helped establish the once-obscure Harvard team on the national track scene.</span></p> <p><span>\"As they made the announcement that we were winning, all the Texas people were saying, 'Harvard? They do track over there?'\" Taylor said after a meet in Texas this spring. \"It was great.\"</span></p> <p><span>Gyorffy has piled up a stack of accolades--All-American, Outstanding Female Athlete of the Meet at Outdoor Heptagonals--but she hopes the most important one is yet to come.</span></p> <p><span>Earlier this spring, she learned that she will represent her native Hungary in the Olympics this September, and she will spend this summer training in hopes that she can match or beat her NCAA-record jump of this year.</span></p> <p><span>\"In an Olympic final, anything can happen,\" Gyorffy says. \"So, I just want to do the best I am capable of on that day. If I leave the track knowing that I did what I could that day, I will be satisfied no matter what.\"</span></p> <p><span>D. Quinn Mills and PSLM</span></p> <p><span>The expansion of benefits for casual workers this spring was remarkable for two reasons. Harvard students, normally apolitical, spoke out loudly. And Harvard administrators, normally invulnerable to student activism, listened to them.</span></p> <p><span>After a year of fact-finding and deliberating, a committee chaired by Weatherhead Professor of Business Administration D. Quinn Mills issued recommendations in May that will significantly improve quality of life for the University's most marginal employees.</span></p> <p><span>Committee members, in turn, credited members of Living Wage Campaign, part of the Progressive Student Labor Movement (PSLM), for providing the impetus for change.</span></p> <p><span>Mills' Ad Hoc Committee on Employment Policies called for extending health care and job training benefits to virtually all University employees, including casual and sub-contracted workers who had previously been only spottily covered. They also asked Harvard to expand a pilot literacy program.</span></p> <p><span>But the committee rejected students' central demand--that Harvard pay a minimum wage of $10.25 to all its workers. Mills said he was \"in broad principle in agreement\" with the living wage but that the proposal was impractical and too rigid.</span></p> <p><span>PSLM members applauded the changes but said they wouldn't give up on a wage increase.</span></p> <p><span>Other activist groups might not have had the stamina to continue, but the Living Wage Campaign has displayed enormous staying power. The group has organized several large rallies, including some of Harvard's most creative demonstrations in years.</span></p> <p><span>During pre-frosh weekend, PSLM staged a teach-in in Byerly Hall to the consternation of admissions officers. In May, they brought actors Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, Class of 1992, to the steps of Littauer to blast Harvard for dawdling on the issue.</span></p> <p><span>Mills' committee and PSLM's activists didn't agree on every point. But their sometimes testy relationship produced real results, and a benefits policy that could improve workers' lives.</span></p> <p><span>Drew Gilpin Faust</span></p> <p><span>The criteria for the first permanent dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study were formidable. President Neil L. Rudenstine was looking for a middle-aged female academic with solid professional credentials, a commitment to gender issues, leadership ability and administrative talent, who was willing to pull up stakes, move to Cambridge and sort through the host of pressing decisions awaiting a new dean.</span></p> <p><span>But nearly everyone at Harvard and Radcliffe agrees that Drew Gilpin Faust will do nicely. After the appointment of Faust, a historian from the University of Pennsylvania, was announced April 2, the praise--and relief--from both quarters was palpable.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is the best appointment Harvard's made in years,\" said Harvard Dean of Freshmen Elizabeth Studley Nathans.</span></p> <p><span>\"[She] gives us a focus, an intellectual center. Now there's someone in authority,\" said Radcliffe Dean for Educational Programs Tamar March.</span></p> <p><span>Faust is a specialist in the Civil War and the author of the well-regarded <i>Mothers of Invention</i>. Currently the director of Penn's women's studies program, she will reassure older alumnae who fear the Institute might shed its historical attention to women.</span></p> <p><span>Before last year's merger, Radcliffe College was accustomed to distant, fractured leadership. Radcliffe's deans hope Faust will bring a firm hand and the intellectual gravitas the Institute will need to establish itself in its first years.</span></p> <p><span>She will control a $350 million endowment and will have authority to decide a range of important questions, from the focus of the Institute's programs to plans for the Agassiz Theatre and Byerly Hall.</span></p> <p><span>The new dean has signaled that she will stand up for her beliefs. The only woman on the Dean's Council, she promises to be an \"agitator\" for the concerns of women, including female undergraduates.</span></p> <p><span>Shaping the Institute would challenge any woman at the helm in coming years. Harvard and Radcliffe both seem to think Faust is more than suited for the task.</span></p> <p><span>Harvey V. Fineberg '67</span></p> <p><span>On the surface, President Neil L. Rudenstine might seem like the year's biggest newsmaker--his decision to step down next spring grabbed headlines last month.</span></p> <p><span>But with the University's capital campaign--Rudenstine's legacy--complete at last, the president has become a lame duck. Inevitably, power and attention will devolve to those around him. And his nearest subordinate, Provost Harvey V. Fineberg '67, is trying to conceal his eagerness to take the reins.</span></p> <p><span>Just as Vice President Al Gore '69 wants to take over from his boss, Fineberg has been touted as the logical candidate to succeed Rudenstine. Articulate and ambitious, the former dean of the School of Public Health has four Harvard degrees.</span></p> <p><span>The projects he has worked on this year are solidly important to the University, if decidedly unsexy. Fineberg's office led the fight this year to curb trademark infringements on the storied Harvard name. He has presided over attempts to bring the massive, flailing computer system called Project ADAPT under control. He is the point man on interfaculty initiatives, a subject long dear to Rudenstine's heart.</span></p> <p><span>Fineberg even played along at an October dinner celebrating the Harvard-Radcliffe merger. The provost and Dean of the Faculty Jeremy R. Knowles donned huge, billowing ball gowns and pirouetted to a Gilbert and Sullivan tune.</span></p> <p><span>But while Fineberg's name has cropped up on most prediction lists, he will face a stiff, competitive presidential search process. The search committee may decide to promote one of Harvard's deans--former president Derek C. Bok was dean of the law school--or find a candidate from another university like Rudenstine, a onetime Princeton provost.</span></p> <p><span>But no matter what the selection committee decides, expect Fineberg to be making a change soon. The number-two position is a logical stepping-stone to higher office--if not at Harvard, then at another university. Fineberg may not have \"provost\" attached to his name for long.</span></p> <p><span>Paul S. Grogan</span></p> <p><span>Whenever Harvard administrators turn their minds to the world beyond the Yard, Paul S. Grogan is usually on hand to point the way.</span></p> <p><span>The vice president for government, community and public affairs has taken an unusually active role this year. Grogan has coordinated Harvard's efforts on issues ranging from Allston land purchases to the city's call for a living wage.</span></p> <p><span>Grogan's burst of energy reflects a newfound commitment in the University to improving relations with the cities of Cambridge and Boston, which bottomed out in 1997 after revelations that Harvard had secretly bought more than 50 acres of Boston land. A former employee of the Boston mayor's office, Grogan was hired last January to help repair the damage.</span></p> <p><span>In September Grogan brokered a plan to pay the city of Boston $40 million in lieu of taxes. The deal ended a two-year stalemate that had stemmed from larger philosophical differences about the payments.</span></p> <p><span>\"The big breakthrough was the appointment of Paul Grogan,\" said Provost Harvey V. Fineberg '67 then. \"He has personal experience and inclination. He knows City Hall.\"</span></p> <p><span>In Cambridge, too, Grogan smoothed over nettlesome issues. He tried to explain away Harvard's seeming intransigence when city councillors called for a living wage. An initiative to provide $20 million in loans to create affordable housing in Cambridge and in Boston went a long way towards soothing hard feelings.</span></p> <p><span>And when Harvard Pilgrim Health Care was threatened with financial ruin, Grogan offered the state attorney general a plan to keep the troubled HMO--and Harvard namesake--afloat.</span></p> <p><span>Grogan regularly travels to Washington and New York to schmooze with reporters and enhance Harvard's reputation.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's about explaining ourselves and making our role visible,\" Grogan says.</span></p> <p><span>Don't be surprised if Grogan is equally visible himself in the months to come.</span></p> <p><span>Andre K. Stuckey</span></p> <p><span>As a rule, crime doesn't pay--unless you're stealing from Harvard students who can never quite remember to lock their doors.</span></p> <p><span>Andre K. Stuckey, the notorious \"Yard Burglar,\" struck room after first-year room this fall and left fear in his wake. But even months into his wave of burglaries, many students still offered ready targets.</span></p> <p><span>Stuckey's spree began in early October, when students in several Matthews Hall rooms awoke to find wallets and cash missing from their common rooms. The burglar's technique couldn't have been simpler--he entered rooms as students slept, ignoring more valuable booty like computers, cell phones and cameras.</span></p> <p><span>First-years were upset by the security breach, a rude awakening only a month after they'd arrived at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>\"I was sleeping right there when this happened,\" Gerby K. Marks '03 said at the time. \"It creeps me out.\"</span></p> <p><span>As the month dragged on, the burglar grew brazen. An encounter the following week with a member of the heavyweight crew team who wrestled him to the ground and whose roommate slammed him against the wall failed to deter the man, now dubbed \"the Yard Burglar.\" A few days later, he began to enter students' rooms during the day.</span></p> <p><span>After being spotted by a proctor in one Matthews room, the Yard Burglar turned back in and said, \"See you later, guys,\" before sprinting down the hallway.</span></p> <p><span>The hijinks couldn't last. On Oct. 22, three weeks into his crime spree, officers of the Harvard University Police Department (HUPD) arrested Andre K. Stuckey for hundreds of dollars worth of burglaries.</span></p> <p><span>When he was released from jail in early December, Stuckey immediately returned to the Yard for a final round of burglaries--the proceeds from which paid for his trip to California. Lucky security officers at UCLA managed to apprehend him before a similar crime wave could begin.</span></p> <p><span>Stuckey returned to Massachusetts in February, for good. He was ordered to serve out a two-year prison sentence, having violated nearly every provision of his probation.</span></p> <p><span>The Yard Burglar proved that hospitality isn't dead in Harvard dorms. First-years unwittingly made Stuckey feel at home--until HUPD found a more fitting one.</span></p>"}
{"title": "After Underdogs Fall, Students Blase About Campaign | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>This November's presidential election will be a pivotal moment in deciding the country's direction on issues from education to gun control to saving Social Security.</span></p> <p><span>But for most Harvard students, as for the rest of the country, the race just has not captivated them this year.</span></p> <p><span>The upstart campaigns of Sen. John S. McCain and former Sen. Bill Bradley drew passionate support from a small group of politically enthused students. But after those campaigns fizzled on Super Tuesday, students say the race lost that momentum.</span></p> <p><span>\"The results from the rest of the country were...sobering,\" said McCain organizer Mattie Germer '03 after her candidate's defeat. \"It was tough to take, but that's the way politics goes. The American public spoke and that's what we'll have to accept.\"</span></p> <p><span>And Bradley and McCain supporters say the campaign's efforts accomplished a seemingly impossible task--for a brief time, they made politics exciting to many students.</span></p> <p><span>\"We felt that we had a candidate we really believed in and that makes a huge difference,\" said Rachel E. Taylor '03 after Bradley's Super Tuesday defeat.</span></p> <p><span>Still, the most adamant student supporters say they hope their efforts were not in vain.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm really proud of what [Bradley] has been able to achieve...in terms of what this year's election debate is going to be about,\" said Luke P. McLoughlin '00, president of Harvard Students for Bradley, in March.</span></p> <p><span>McLoughlin credits Bradley with bringing up issues that never would have come to light, such as race relations and poverty.</span></p> <p><span>For supporters of Vice President Al Gore '69 and Gov. George W. Bush, it has been a more fruitful year. The students supporting them say they are hopeful for the fall.</span></p> <p><span>Robert R. Porter '00-'02, who is coordinating the campus effort for Bush, says the effort is worthwhile.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's grunt work, but it's fun,\" Porter says. \"Seeing the effectiveness, talking to people about the issues--that's the part I enjoy. Going canvassing can actually make a difference.\"</span></p> <p><span>Marcie B. Bianco '02, the state coordinator of Students for Gore, is hopeful about the vice president's chances in the race.</span></p> <p><span>\"His campaign seems to have hit a stride. He's gotten accustomed to stepping up and being the leader, as opposed to second-in-command. He's got a winning effort,\" Bianco said after a March rally in Boston.</span></p> <p><span>But Bianco and Porter are the exception among students. Although this could have been the year for a surge in student involvement in politics, the majority has remained largely apathetic about the campaign and their political beliefs.</span></p> <p><span>With the surge in Internet startups and investment banking, some politically-minded students say their peers think the way to change the world is with their pocketbooks, not their voices.</span></p> <p><span>\"'Have people gone from Washington to Wall Street?' is the big question,\" says Marc Stad '01, president of the College Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>Winthrop Professor of History Stephen A. Thernstrom says graduates' growing prosperity makes them less concerned with political fights.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is a sense of entitlement and privilege that comes through,\" Thernstrom says.</span></p> <p><span>Empirical evidence backs up the perception that students are less involved. In a poll released in March by Harvard's Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, 55 percent of those surveyed said the campaign was \"boring\" and only 25 percent termed it \"exciting.\"</span></p> <p><span>Whatever the reason, in many ways students at Harvard have stopped acting on their ideologies.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard is still a liberal place--in a Crimson poll conducted earlier this year, almost half of Harvard students identified themselves as liberal, a third as moderate and a sixth as conservative.</span></p> <p><span>But other studies suggest students now express their convictions through public service rather than voting or political organizing.</span></p> <p><span>According to a survey in early May by the Institute of Politics (IOP), Harvard students who want change say community service is the only feasible method.</span></p> <p><span>Of the 300 students polled, 78 percent had performed service in the past year, whereas only 38.7 percent had been a part of a political organization. Less than 25 percent had volunteered for a political campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\"[Students] aren't against politics in the abstract--they just think it is more difficult to get involved in politics,\" said Trevor D. Dryer '00-'02, who co-chaired the committee that developed the survey. \"Community service is easier and you see more tangible results.\"</span></p> <p><span>Observers propose various theories to account for the change.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's the after-effects of an entire shift in the culture towards individualism against deferentialism and authority and tradition,\" says Ramesh A. Ponnuru, a senior editor at the National Review, a conservative opinion magazine.</span></p> <p><span>Stad says that in comparison to the 1960s when hundreds of students participated in even the smallest elections, students today have no one concrete issue to fight for, making for little enthusiasm in the political arena.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is very little passion for today's issues,\" he says. \"There's not a revolutionary issue for students to rally around.

{"title": "Who Sues Harvard? | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Harvard presents itself as a tolerant and welcoming institution.</span></p> <p><span>For the most part, evidence seems to bear this assertion out: student retention rates are the highest in the nation, almost all undergraduates live on campus, admissions yield rates continue to climb and giving by alumni is extremely generous.</span></p> <p><span>But there are those who have their quibbles. So like any large institution, particularly one with so much influence in just about every powerful area of government and academic life, Harvard faces its share of lawsuits.</span></p> <p><span>A review of pending and recently adjudicated litigation against Harvard shows that some plaintiffs are taking advantage of the Harvard name; others bring wholly unjustified--and often unusual--claims before the court. The vast majority of Harvard cases are stopped before trial by Harvard's legal machine--many are settled out of court.</span></p> <p><span>Most start as photocopied sheets, turned in to the clerk's office at the Middlesex County Courthouse on Thorndike Street. A select few make it to the United States District Court in South Boston.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the publicity that these cases may garner, members of Harvard's Office of the General Counsel (OGC) say that overall these suits take up little of the lawyers' time.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>The Lonely Few </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Over the last two-and-a-half years, Harvard has faced 20 lawsuits.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>\"We don't have many lawsuits for an entity as large as Harvard,\" says Vice President and General Counsel Anne Taylor. \"We, as an institution, are good at what we do, so we don't [get sued much].\"</span></p> <p><span>Taylor says that in the 17 years she has worked for Harvard, she thinks only about five claims against Harvard have ever been tried before a jury.</span></p> <p><span>\"Good lawyers have failed if a complaint gets to a lawsuit,\" she says. \"We try hard not to get sued.\"</span></p> <p><span>She says easy solutions to avoid a lawsuit include sending a letter of apology, or helping people find appropriate resources to resolve their problems.</span></p> <p><span>But when the University does get sued, it defends itself like a parent bird whose nest has been violated.</span></p> <p><span>Tamara E. Awerbuch, an employee of the School of Public Health, is suing the University for sexual harassment. The is case scheduled to go to trial this month.</span></p> <p><span>\"Nothing to me is unexpected from Harvard,\"  she says . \"They are defending themselves extremely vigorously.\"</span></p> <p><span>According to David C. Casey, a Boston lawyer with Bingham Dana who Harvard often hires to help with its defenses, this vigor in arguing its case does not prevent Harvard from attempting to settle lawsuits.</span></p> <p><span>\"If there is an appropriate way short of litigation, Harvard tries to do that,\" Casey says. \"They're [Harvard's lawyers] reasonable people.\"</span></p> <p><span>Yet he says Harvard only will settle when it is being presented with what it feels are reasonable demands.</span></p> <p><span>Quite a few of the lawsuits filed against the University in the last two and-a-half years were indeed settled before reaching a judge or jury.</span></p> <p><span>These include two 1998 suits in Middlesex Superior Court from the family of Trang Phuong Ho, who was killed by her Dunster House roommate in 1995.</span></p> <p><span>Also, in 1998 Harvard settled a suit by an undergraduate who was injured in 1995 when a windowpane fell on her head in the Museum of Comparative Zoology building. Recently, the Harvard Business Review was sued in Federal District Court for using the term \"breakthrough thinking,\" a term trademarked by another company, in one of their publications.</span></p> <p><span>The suit was settled the same year.</span></p> <p><span>While the University often defends employees who are sued in their capacity as Harvard workers, it does not provide them absolute immunity.</span></p> <p><span>According to Taylor, the University will not defend employees from any action which was not a part of their official duties or which showed gross negligence.</span></p> <p><span>She notes, for example, the University would not defend an individual who was genuinely guilty--in the University's eyes--of sexual harassment.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>The Office </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Defending the University from actual lawsuits is in fact such a small portion of the OGC's work that most cases involving lawsuits are handled predominantly by lawyers at Boston law firms. The University contracts work to them on a case-by-case basis.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Taylor says that this system saves Harvard money.</span></p> <p><span>\"We're not staffed to [take cases to trial],\" Taylor says. She notes that one case will typically occupy all of a lawyer's time for a period of four or five months, something that an office of ten lawyers cannot afford.</span></p> <p><span>Casey says that such a strategy is not unusual for large institutions.</span></p> <p><span>However, even in the cases where outside attorneys are used, they are still supervised by OGC.</span></p> <p><span>According to Taylor defending the University against lawsuits is only a \"teeny-weeny\" fraction of the OGC's mission which \"is to provide legal advice to the University.\"  So the office spends most of its time solving non-litigation problems as requested by the various Harvard schools.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>The Risk of Employment </b><p> </p><p></p></font>The few complaints that do actually make it to the courthouse, Taylor says, are generally related to employment.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>For example, in 1998, there were two cases filed in Middlesex Superior Court by former Harvard employees.</span></p> <p><span>One case involved Dinah K. Bodkin, a former instructor at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and researcher at Brockton/West Roxbury Veterans Administration Medical Center, a Harvard-affiliated hospital.</span></p> <p><span>Bodkin claims she was fired from these positions because she reported what she claims were procedural lapses in the scientific study conducted by another HMS doctor. She says her dismissal violated the school's policies on reporting scientific problems, and ended her career as a research scientist. She is seeking $450,000 in damages. The case is still active.</span></p> <p><span>Also in 1998, a former University security guard who worked for the University from 1988-1989 sued Harvard after learning that personally damaging information was included in his personnel file. He alleges that the University promised to remove the information after he voluntarily resigned. When he applied for a job with a Florida police department and his file was sent there, however, the information was still included in the file.</span></p> <p><span>A judge quickly dismissed the suit because too much time had elapsed between the alleged actions and the suit.</span></p> <p><span>Taylor says that employment is a very big source of the risk that the University faces.</span></p> <p><span>To mitigate this risk as much as possible, OGC provides significant training to various units of the University to avoid legal problems.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Searching the Files </b><p> </p><p></p></font>While employment issues may be a major source of litigation, a bulk of the lawsuits since 1998 defy any quick summary.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Two cases involve unsatisfied doctoral candidates, one at the Graduate School of Education and one at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Both suits claim that the schools unfairly dismissed the students from their graduate programs and thus adversely affected their lives. One of them is still pending.</span></p> <p><span>Another case sought $500,000 against the University, claiming the police unfairly banned a woman from entering Harvard buildings after she caused disruptions.</span></p> <p><span>Several other cases were filed against Harvard in its capacity as the owner and landlord of Cambridge property. In one an individual fell on a sidewalk outside of a Harvard-owned building in 1996 during a winter storm.</span></p> <p><span>Finally, Harvard was one of many defendants in a multi-billion dollar suit by a woman who claimed to have been \"illegally implanted\" by the federal government with a devise known as a \"CATO,\" that caused great harm. Other defendants in the suit included former President George Bush, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) and the Pentagon.</span></p> <p><span>This suit was almost immediately dismissed by a judge for having \"no basis.\"</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>The Harvard Name </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Most agree that the Harvard name and the image of the institution represented by the name play a role in the litigation faced by the University.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Taylor believes the name and the image of the University as holder of great wealth serve as the impetus for people and organizations to sue.</span></p> <p><span>Additionally, she says, if the case does make it to a jury trial, the jury members may side with the \"little guy\" plaintiff because jurors often view large institutions unsympathetically.</span></p> <p><span>\"The jury is always a crapshoot,\" says Taylor. \"Juries often see a David and Goliath battle.\"</span></p> <p><span>Casey, however, says this fear is not a reality.</span></p> <p><span>\"In the abstract one could worry about that dynamic,\" Casey says. \"I have found many more times jurors take the oath thoughtfully and do not look at the wealth of the defendant. In my experience, Harvard has fared well.\"</span></p> <p><span>However, one individual currently engaged in litigation against the University feels quite differently, saying Harvard's great wealth often \"intimidates\" individuals from suing the University.</span></p> <p><span>\"People tell me 'you're never going to win against them,'\" Awerbuch says. \"They can fight forever.\"</span></p>"}

The announcement was not a complete surprise, as she was Nader's running mate in 1996, when Nader made an unsuccessful run for the presidency, also on the Green Party ticket.</span></p> <p><span>LaDuke, a resident of Adams House while an undergraduate, is a resident of the White Earth Indian Reservation in northwest Minnesota. She is known for her activism on American Indians' economic and environmental issues, working to have land returned to her native Objibwa tribe. She is also a published author and a farmer.</span></p> <p><span>During the last election, LaDuke proposed a constitutional amendment that would provide protection for certain kinds of natural resources for seven generations. She cites clear-cutting and air and water pollution as acts that would violate such a requirement.</span></p> <p><span>In 1996 the Nader-LaDuke team finished fourth in the popular vote, receiving 0.71 percent of the vote.</span></p> <p><span>Nader, who made a campaign stop at MIT last month, has indicated he will run a much more active campaign this year than he did in 1996. In that election he only spent $5,000.</span></p> <p><span>He is also seeking inclusion on all 50 states' ballots this year and has filed suit against the state of North Carolina, claiming state laws make it too difficult for third-party candidates to make it on the ballot. Nader was on only 21 states' ballots in 1996.</span></p> <p><span>According to results of an April Zogby's Poll posted on Nader's website, his preliminary efforts seem to be paying off. According to the poll, Nader has the support of 5.7 percent of likely voters. This was above the level of support Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan commanded in the same poll.</span></p> <p><span>One of Nader's main issues this election will be campaign finance reform.

At the center of it all is \"Meet the Press\" moderator Tim Russert--a staple on the American political scene, one of the most respected broadcast journalists in the country and today's Harvard Law School Class Day speaker.</span></p> <p><span>During Russert's nearly 10-year tenure, \"Meet the Press\" has become a ritual for its average 4.2 million viewers, growing into the highest-rated Sunday morning interview program and the most quoted news program in the world.</span></p> <p><span>Russert, who serves as senior vice president and Washington bureau chief for NBC News, also anchors his own program on CNBC about the role of media in American society and is a contributing anchor for NBC's other cable news channel, MSNBC.</span></p> <p><span>Not bad for someone who started his journalism career just 16 years ago.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Meet Tim Russert </b><p> </p><p></p></font>When Russert came to NBC in 1984, he was a journalism novice but no stranger to politics and the law.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Born in Buffalo, New York on May 7, 1950, Russert grew up attending Catholic schools. He graduated from John Carroll University, a Jesuit university in Ohio, before graduating with honors from the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law.</span></p> <p><span>Because of his family's blue-collar background, Russert had to work to put himself through college and law school.\t\"For four summers, I picked up garbage, delivered the Buffalo News, made pizza, drove a cab,\" Russert told George magazine recently. \"That was my summer vacation.\"</span></p> <p><span>After passing the bar in New York and the District of Columbia, Russert began what seemed would be a long and distinguished career in politics.</span></p> <p><span>Russert got his start volunteering for Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), driving with him on campaign road trips in New York.</span></p> <p><span>Moynihan recounted in an interview with The Crimson how Russert got his start in Moynihan's Washington office.</span></p> <p><span>\"My wife, who knows more about politics than I do, said to me, 'Do you remember that nice, young man from Buffalo? Why don't you see about bringing him to Washington?'\" Moynihan says.</span></p> <p><span>Russert quickly moved up in the ranks, becoming Moynihan's chief of staff in Washington D.C. by the age of 29.</span></p> <p><span>\"He took over the regional offices in New York, and he was so good at it, that one thing led to another, and the rest is history,\" Moynihan adds.</span></p> <p><span>But in 1984, after two years in New York Governor Mario Cuomo's office, Russert's plans changed as he made the leap from politics to media.</span></p> <p><span>\"In eight years, I had done it--made the best contribution, learned as much as I could. And I wanted to start a family,\" Russert said in his George interview.</span></p> <p><span>Russert joined NBC News that year, hoping to put his legal training and governmental background to use in media. He was hired as vice president and assistant to the president of NBC News in New York. By April 1985, he was working behind the scenes, supervising the \"Today\" show's live broadcasts from Rome.</span></p> <p><span>During that visit, Russert arranged the first-ever appearance by Pope John Paul II on an American television news program. In a commencement address to the Columbus School of Law in 1997, Russert recounted his first meeting with the pope.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'll never forget it,\" Russert said. \"The door opened, there he was, dressed in white. I was there alone. As he approached me, my mind quickly turned away from Bryant Gumbel's career and NBC's ratings toward the notion of salvation. And you heard this tough, no nonsense, hard-hitting questioner from 'Meet the Press,' a trained attorney, begin my exchange, 'Bless me, Father.'\"</span></p> <p><span>After the Rome broadcast, Russert continued working behind the scenes, leading NBC's weeklong broadcasts from South America, Australia and China in 1986 and 1987.

In 1999, he broke the story that Hillary Rodham Clinton might consider running for the open U.S. Senate seat in New York.</span></p> <p><span>Last month, Russert landed the first exclusive interview with Rudolph W. Giuliani after the New York City mayor announced he would not run for the Senate.</span></p> <p><span>Many in the political world see \"Meet the Press\" as <i>the</i> place to break news and political announcements, Fischer says. The show is political press secretaries' favorite place to send their bosses, according to a<b> </b>recent survey published in George.</span></p> <p><span>While Russert's colleagues say his passion for law and politics makes him take the show very seriously, his personal qualities make him \"fun to work with.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"He is very jovial and good-natured, and obviously very intelligent,\" Fischer says.</span></p> <p><span>\"He's friendly and cheerful,\" Kristol says. \"He has a very ebullient personality.\"</span></p> <p><span>The show has had its lighter moments, such as the back-and-forth bickering of political odd couple James Carville and Mary Matalin, who are regular guests.</span></p> <p><span>And in 1993, Russert broadcast the program from the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, where his Buffalo Bills were taking on the Dallas Cowboys in the Super Bowl.</span></p> <p><span>Russert recounted his memory of the event in his Columbus School of Law speech.</span></p> <p><span>\"At the end of the program, I looked into the camera and said 'It's now in God's hands.

{"title": "A White Elephant By the Bay | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>SAN FRANCISCO--As Widener Library slumbers in the dimness of a year-long renovation, the new San Francisco Public Library shines in the California sun a continent away. For a budding scholar accustomed to Widener's overbrimming stacks, tiny windows and rustic chain-link and gun-metal decor, the glossy Main Library in San Francisco's Civic Center seems like a revelation, the Tiffany's of libraries. Four years ago architectural critics and booklovers alike predicted that the Main would set a new standard for libraries--a spiffy, sparkling alternative to old caverns like Widener. But as the glow of newness fades, the Main is looking more and more like a white elephant, a politically correct community center with precious little academic heft.</span></p> <p><span>The $137-million main branch of the San Francisco Public Library, which opened in 1996, was meant to become a literary monument. In contrast to its predecessor, sometimes called \"a urinal with books,\" the new building is architecturally immaculate: The gleaming white-tiled facade is both dignified and contemporary, while inside, a white atrium rises to a huge round skylight that fills the building with light.</span></p> <p><span>The furnishings are self-consciously expensive and up-to-date, from quietly ornate hardwood desks to glass-backed carrels with individual modem access. The library even boasts the requisite huge, unattractive art installations of the kind found chiefly in modern civic buildings. And it's crammed with helpful amenities, including a top-floor exhibition gallery, a roof terrace, an auditorium, an \"educational guidance center\" and a cafe.</span></p> <p><span>So tasteful and forward-thinking is the Main Library that it's almost possible to overlook its biggest lack--books. Bookshelves seem like an afterthought amid the \"centers\" and galleries that line the building, so much so that the stacks are omitted entirely from the map distributed at the information desk. The entire general fiction collection, for instance, is contained in one row of bookshelves along a single wall. While the Main claims about a million books, most are hidden away in special compact stacks accessible only to staff members, or in underground storage areas from which titles must be specially requested. Several floors of the building lack any bookshelves at all. A city report published early this year calculated that the library will require millions of dollars in renovations after only four years just to accommodate its growing collection.</span></p> <p><span>While entire collections like fiction are pushed unmarked to the side, the library does highlight certain specialized categories of books in \"centers\" with their own stacks and reading rooms. Most are devoted to identity groups, a reward for heavy fundraising efforts in minority communities: the African American Center, the Chinese Center, the Filipino American Center, the Gay and Lesbian Center. The library's Rainbow Coalition feel is rounded out by a large international center with foreign-language books, and even an Environmental Center with books about conservation. The San Francisco Public Library may be the first in the country to be organized around Democratic core constituencies--Al Gore '69 could accomplish a full day of campaigning just by taking the elevator between floors.</span></p> <p><span>If the politics of this system is suspect--one suspects a library's organization shouldn't coincide with its fundraising drives--then the intellectual integrity is more so. Each center is an independent reference collection whose books do not circulate, implying that their internal unity is too important to be disrupted by library patrons.</span></p> <p><span>But is identity the most logical or academically honest way to classify knowledge? Consider the James C. Hormel Gay and Lesbian Center, which achieved a brief moment of fame two years ago after conservative senators tried to use its more prurient components to block Hormel's nomination to be ambassador to Luxembourg. Alongside the racy books that so flustered Jesse Helms are such bland fare as Love, Ellen, Betty Degeneres's heartwarming tribute to her lesbian daughter, or the newest biography of k.d. lang. Academic tomes about lesbian and gay studies nestle alongside gay personal finance books and travel guides. The selection spans the Dewey Decimal System, with books selected not for their specific subject matter, their intellectual approach or even their merit, but rather for their presumed appeal to gay and lesbian readers. That appeal, moreover, is calculated as narrowly as possible, so that the mere mention of gayness in a book's title qualifies it for admission. A reader's understanding of homosexuality might be profoundly influenced by Nabokov's Pale Fire or the tales of Henry James, or by Shakespeare's plays or Homer's epics; instead, the Hormel Center offers The Gay Book of Quotations.</span></p> <p><span>Such an approach would not be quite so offensive if the library had equally strong centers devoted to poetry, or English literature, or biology, or history or art. But aside from a few seemingly random choices (the Business and Technology Center, the Steve Silver/Beach Blanket Babylon Music Center), virtually all the centers focus on particular racial, ethnic or sexual minorities. The library's mission statement declares that the Main Library is dedicated to promoting \"the joys of reading for our diverse community,\" but the centers interpret that diversity in the most literal sense. A \"center\" for black readers ought to contain more than books on race; a gay man or woman might have interests beyond k.d. lang's life story.</span></p> <p><span>Worse, the centers encourage heterosexuals and white people to consider themselves exempt from critically examining topics like sexuality and race; rather than encouraging such study, the centers ghettoize it. In fact, the library as a whole is itself the most appropriate African American Center, the ideal Gay and Lesbian Center; the best place for readers of any race or ethnicity or sexual orientation seeking to broaden their knowledge and their perspective on the world. The actual users of the Main Library are an eloquent confirmation of that fact. On a weekday afternoon they sprawl on the expensive chairs and sit at the wired wooden desks, reading contentedly, together in the stacks.

The library should be a home for books; the architecture will take care of itself.</span></p> <p><span><i>Adam A.

{"title": "United, We Scorn | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>NEW YORK--A couple of Thursdays ago was my first baseball game in, admittedly, a long time. It was nothing like what I remembered about ballgames. The stadium had been packed--even where I was, on the third deck--and there had been an almost savage tension in the air. Then again, I had never attended a famed Mets game on their own home turf, with La Guardia planes flying overhead and all, and one more thing: It was John Rocker's return to Shea Stadium.</span></p> <p><span>The New York Times had warned that there would be more than 600 police officers roaming the stadium to control especially fervent anti-Rocker fans. Although nothing in particular called for such an outpouring of NYPD officers, I'll admit that the security was a wise decision on the part of the police department. Especially in light of last month's Los Angeles Lakers fan-instigated riots, the NYPD had to be prepared for anything. Despite the extensive preparations--the cop standing guard at my seating section had been there since 1 p.m.--nothing of consequence happened.</span></p> <p><span>Some contend that John Rocker's arguments in that fateful Sports Illustrated interview do not render him worthy of punishment. Famed conservative commentator Dennis Prager has defended Rocker to the hilt. In The Weekly Standard, Prager wrote that Rocker's disparaging remarks about Manhattan and its minority inhabitants \"merit as little attention as comic books\"--not the \"hysteria\" that the closing pitcher has received. On his talk show, Prager asserted that Rocker was simply exercising his freedom of speech and had never taken any action against the people who commute on the No. 7 subway train. Why shouldn't he be able to say what he wants?</span></p> <p><span>In all fairness, though, the New Yorkers had free reign to retaliate. Rocker made unsolicited, ungrounded and rude comments about Asians, women, New Yorkers, foreigners and blacks. And the people of the greater Manhattan area fought back with the same weapons: words. The vendors outside Shea Stadium were making a killing selling anti-Rocker apparel. A large majority of the audience donned specially designed T-shirts claiming the standard \"John Rocker sucks\" to the more creative \"Rocker sucks Cox.\" (The aforementioned \"Cox,\" of course, refers to Braves manager Bobby Cox.) One man proudly displayed a sign meant to read, \"How do you spell Ignorant? R-O-C-K-E-R.\" (Unfortunately, the sign spelled ignorant, \"ingorant.\") Rocker's name has been sullied, booed and hissed more than any athlete in my generation. And I can attest to it.</span></p> <p><span>Prager and others characterize New York's reactions to Rocker as \"hysterical,\" as a product of the media-mob, and as so ridiculous that it could not possibly yield commendable consequences. Say it ain't so, Joe.</span></p> <p><span>There are benefits from the rivalry that exists between John Rocker and the rest of New York that extend beyond the marketability of the feud. Mets' fans hatred for the not-so-impressive Rocker (he had been demoted to the minor leagues just a few weeks ago) united the stadium in energy and enthusiasm. Rarely does anything today inspire entire groups of people to feel passionate and moved--or even just excited.</span></p> <p><span>Most indicative of this is our depressingly dull presidential race. USA Today ran a fantastic graphic that showed a face split between that of Vice President Al Gore '69 and Texas Gov. George W. Bush. The two halves were practically identical. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, a unique and interesting individual who has unfortunately been quarantined from the presidential debates, summed up the political predicament perfectly. In an interview last week, Nader was asked if it would bother him that his presence in the presidential race helped to elect George W. Bush. He responded, \"Not at all. I mean, you're dealing with Democratic do-littles and Republican do-nothings. And that's just not enough for the American people.\"</span></p> <p><span>As dreary as the presidential race looks, there is hope on the horizon. Thankfully, the Rocker syndrome has struck more than just baseball; it has infected--and thus inspired--our politics, too. Consider this year's New York Senate race: When Rudolph W. Giuliani was still running, the contest focused on the popular opinion of the New York City mayor. Votes were determined by an assessment of the mayor's performance in office. (Hillary Clinton, of course, had done nothing for New York and there was no means of judging her performance.) Now that the mayor has excused himself from the race, and only Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio remain, the Rocker syndrome has stepped up to the plate to fill the vacancy.</span></p> <p><span>Whereas Rudy was once the stick by which voters measured and cast their ballots, Clinton is now the driving--or repelling--force. The week that Giuliani waved the Senate seat goodbye, a Times/CBS poll showed Lazio owning a paltry percentage of the New York vote. Weeks later, he had worked his way up to a hefty 39 percent.</span></p> <p><span>What had happened? Lazio hadn't reformed his platform, he hadn't given an inch to the left, and he hadn't played into anyone's hand. No matter their political ideology or their hopes for reform, a significant percentage of the New York vote simply despised Clinton and would do anything possible to avoid her representing them on Capitol Hill--even if it meant boarding the ship of an underdog with little to no chance of victory.</span></p> <p><span>The Rocker syndrome has struck again. More than platforms or ideals or issues, bitterness and ill-will continue to drive the New York Senate race. If Lazio wins, it will probably be not so much because New Yorkers embrace his vision but rather because they could not muster the strength to cast their ballot for a non-New Yorker (And let that be the least of their problems with Clinton). But this may not be such a bad thing. New York politics are interesting again. There's a real and important issue to discuss and the race is receiving attention. The impetus behind the political excitement? Resentment, skepticism and dislike. The result? An energized, live and fluctuating electorate.</span></p> <p><span>Without doubt, the consequences that result from intense dislike are not always so fortuitous. But if it is enough to unite thousands within a diverse community, enough to energize a political race and enough to discourage us from throwing our hands up--and throwing the towel in--because of disinterest and disgust, then it's a start.</span></p> <p><span><i>Jordana R.

{"title": "To Beat Bush, Gore Should Emulate Blair | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>LONDON--Tony Blair has been having a rough time of it recently: Leaked memos, accusations of being more concerned with his image than his government, poor poll showings, bickering between cabinet ministers, heckling at his speeches and worst of all, his teenage son found passed out in his own vomit in central London.</span></p> <p><span>Vice-President Al Gore '69 hasn't had it much better. The press is ignoring him, the polls are against him and even if he achieves a big \"bounce\" from the upcoming convention, his chosen VP can still upstage him.</span></p> <p><span>There is no doubt that Blair would like things to continue as they are between the U.S. and the U.K. The famous Clinton-Blair constellation has shone brightly in both countries, making Blair seem privileged in America's favors, Clinton seem more cultured. In the interest of preserving this mutual \"most favored nation\" friendship Blair might be spending less time worrying about \"eye-catching initiatives\" and more time trying to boost his future co-world-leader's spirits.</span></p> <p><span>This is what a leaked memo from the Blair camp to the Gore camp might look like:</span></p> <p><span>FROM: TB</span></p> <p><span>TO: Al</span></p> <p><span>RE: Campaign 2000</span></p> <p><span>Cheer up old boy, it's not as bad as it looks. Sure, you're down in the polls, so am I. But don't buy into doom-and-gloom politics. It's all about putting a positive spin on things.</span></p> <p><span>First, don't let your opposition scare you. I assure you, the more seriously you take your opponent, the more seriously everyone else will take him. This is why I take every opportunity to publicly guffaw in the face of Conservative Party Leader William Hague. This just reassures the public that indeed, the smarter man is running the government. It also makes Hague seem like a laughable little insect, instead of a rather devastating parliamentarian.</span></p> <p><span>It doesn't sound like this will be hard to do in your case. George W. appears to all outside observers to be nothing more than an airhead son of privilege. Where did he get his \"elite\" education? Yale? Never heard of it. Despite the apparent vulnerability of George Jr. I hear you have some personal stumbling blocks. Let me suggest, if you have problems laughing naturally, practice in front of the mirror. In order to adopt the proper tone of voice, try slowing down your words (creating the impression Georgie is too slow to understand), lengthen your A's and strengthen your consonants. Most importantly, roll your eyes at the mention of his latest proposals. Accomplish in a simple gesture what you will then spend a few choice words on as you nail the lid on his coffin.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking of words, when talking about Bush Minor, I suggest using words like \"pathetic,\" \"pitiful\" and \"puerile.\" If those don't strike a cord with the public, try \"irresponsible,\" \"irritating\" and \"immature.\" I guarantee this will boost your alpha male quotient as well as your ego.</span></p> <p><span>I know that people have been concerned with your focus on attacking Bush instead of laying a foundation of ideas for your campaign. But remember, to dismiss the other candidate as an intellectual lightweight is not an attack. It's a dismissal. And the sooner you get Bush out of the spotlight with an aristocratic wave of your hand (come on, we both know it's in the blood) the sooner you can get the voters to start focusing on your issues, like the environment or the Internet or whatever (Just a tip: People are generally more concerned about things like the price of oil and pensioners).</span></p> <p><span>Speaking of focusing on the positive, remember, it's your government that's in power. I know you want to avoid Clinton fatigue, but frankly, forget about it. The fact is, voters are enjoying the economic boom that has taken place in the last eight years. Ask them (as Reagan did in '80 and '84) are they better off now than they were four years ago? Do they want continued prosperity which can fund greater social services, or do they want massive tax cuts for the same few hundred impossibly wealthy Americans who would have benefited from the estate tax repeal? Your voters want wider health care coverage, certain social security and safety from crime. They don't particularly want the rich (look directly at Bush when you say this) to keep getting richer, while the poor get poorer. Talk about bringing the fruits of economic success to everyone's table.</span></p> <p><span>Stay away from Clinton-esque scandal, but exploit his record. The last eight years haven't been all Lewinsky, you know. There's a legacy of Democratic success to build on.</span></p> <p><span>Which brings me to the \"New Democrat\" side of things. You may have heard that I've abandoned the \"New Labour\" brand for the traditional idealism of plain-old Labour. I'm hoping to capture the sense of integrity that Bradley and Nader get from identifying with old-fashioned liberalism. And if there's anything you and I could do with a healthy dose of in the public eye, it's integrity. You have your shady fundraising, I have my spin-doctors on the public payroll. What we both need is an aura of idealism that a return to traditional liberal values can provide.</span></p> <p><span>Remember, if worst comes to worst you can always get a secret service agent to pour liquor down young Al's throat and toss him out on the streets of the capitol. It will get you major sympathy points from both press and populace. I doubled Euan's allowance after he was fined 50 quid for being drunk in public.</span></p> <p><span>Good luck Al!

In fact, both parties use presidential debates and the bipartisan (but not nonpartisan) debate commission to exclude smaller party candidates from the political process. The commission's current criteria for inclusion in the debates is 15 percent support in several pre-debate polls. This makes it impossible for a candidate, without a large amount of money to spend and without the free publicity the major party candidates receive from the news media and from convention coverage, to use the debates to introduce him or herself to the electorate.</span></p> <p><span>Ross Perot was included in the 1992 debates and his participation contributed to high voter turnout and won him some 20 percent of the popular vote. Despite the fact that one in five voters supported Perot in 1992, the Commission kept him out of the 1996 debates--he did not even win a tenth of the popular vote that year. Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura was polling around 8 percent before his state's televised debate--it was his performance in that debate which helped him win the election, gaining around a third of the popular vote.</span></p> <p><span>These examples highlight the important role debates can have in shaping the scope of the political discussion. Any Bush/Gore debate that excludes Green Party candidate Ralph Nader and Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan will be a Democrat-Republican collusion to control the scope of the political discussion in this country. Whatever one thinks of the merits of either minor party candidate, they have exciting ideas which ought to be debated and discussed.</span></p> <p><span>No alternative to the Democrat and Republican parties can emerge  in national politics so long as those parties control our access to political discourse via debates.</span></p> <p><span>Texas Gov. George W. Bush's negotiations regarding the debates may have been a transparent attempt to avoid a well publicized debate with Vice President Al Gore '69. But Gore, in refusing to debate with the minor party candidates is refusing to engage the harsh criticism of his platform that the minor parties represent.</span></p> <p><span><i>David Wolkenfeld '03 </i></span></p> <p><span>Sept. 14, 2000</span></p>"}
{"title": "Three Campaign Myths | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>As the fall 2000 campaign gets into gear, the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates will be sure to keep the spin hot and heavy, especially in the debates (whenever they are). But before you try to separate the fact from the fiction, here are some myths which are important to debunk before we help choose the world's Most Powerful Man (and his sidekick).</span></p> <p><span>Myth #1: Joe Lieberman is a moderate. When Al Gore '69 chose the Connecticut senator, the media and Democratic faithful were gleeful about Lieberman's supposedly centrist message. The truth is, however, Lieberman isn't nearly as moderate as he is portrayed. The ultra-liberal Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) has given him a gold-star rating, second only to Massachusetts' favorite Senator, Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56, for voting with them 95 percent of the time.</span></p> <p><span>Supporters have crooned that it's the other five percent that matters. Well, you can kiss even that five percent goodbye. All of Lieberman's centrist leanings have been ditched for the position of number two yes-man. In 1995, Lieberman was attacked by Jesse Jackson as \"irresponsible\" for his bold statements against affirmative action and Proposition 209, the  California initiative against racial preferences. Lieberman said that \"the current system of group preferences has to end. For after all, if you discriminate in favor of one group on the basis of race, you thereby discriminate against another group on the basis of race.\" He concluded that \"you can't defend policies that are based on group preferences.\" Fast forward to the Democratic National Convention this summer, when Lieberman quickly repudiated these earlier comments. He announced that he had changed his views, saying that he \"did not understand the language\" of Proposition 209, which he had so eloquently supported in 1995. This radical departure from his previous position, as the National Review put it, \"makes him either look like an idiot or a coward.\"</span></p> <p><span>Lieberman has also swallowed his convictions on another issue that most American agree on: school choice. When he was grilled about his anti-school voucher stance on August 14, he said, \"If you ask me personally, I'm still for vouchers. But I understand how it is when you are vice-president.\" The next day, when a crowd of teacher's union members at the Democratic convention began to get testy about vouchers: \"If you want me to stay silent on the issue, vote Gore/Lieberman in September.\" Integrity? Nobody ever said politicians were honorable. Joe Lieberman used to be the exception. Not anymore. The voters should see the election as it is--a contest between liberal and conservative, not between \"integrity\" and \"compassion.\"</span></p> <p><span>Myth #2: Bush's tax plan is safe for the economy. Much has been made about the Bush tax plan, since the Texas Governor has revealed precious little about any of his other policy proposals. The question is whether Bush's proposals are really skewed towards the rich, as the Democrats like to complain. If so, the failure of supply-side that characterized the Reagan era and contributed to a massive federal budget deficit could rear its ugly head again.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, this is the case. About half of the $1.6 trillion tax cut--that's more than half of the projected budget surplus, which is itself a wobbly estimate and is already being spent by Congress--will go to families with an income over $250,000. Princeton economist Paul Krugman estimates that even a family making $80,000 a year would get less than $20 per week off its taxes once the plan was fully phased in; a family making $1 million would get $1,000 per week. Giving surplus money back to the people is the backbone of self-government, but the money must be accounted for first. Even Bush officials admit that the figures Bush use in campaign speeches are less than the actual numbers necessary to pull the tax cut off.</span></p> <p><span>Myth #3: Al Gore and Bill Clinton can take credit for the economic boom of the last decade. In 1994, Bill Clinton was in the dumps. Hillary's attempt at socializing health care had failed miserably, and two years of a Democratic White House and a Democratic Congress had produced a 34 percent approval rating, a still slumping economy and many sleepless nights. It also led to the Republican Revolution of 1994--which brought a balanced budget and tax relief. The economy began to take off, and by re-election year 1996, Clinton was on his way to a second term.</span></p> <p><span>In the end, neither the Democrats nor the Republicans are solely or even partly responsible for the shape of the economy. The rise of the new economy and the increased productivity that its technology brought were more responsible than anything either branch of government could devise. Yet it was the Republicans' angry prodding--and the occasional shut-down of the government--that forced Clinton's hand in addressing fiscal responsibility.</span></p> <p><span>A lot of the people I talked to this summer, from my mom to my barber, believed the last myth about the \"Clinton/Gore economic miracle.\" Yet they were wrong. Which is why, when you hear the talking heads at the stump, it always helps to be a little skeptical.</span></p> <p><span><i>Vasant M.

They are making goats' heads out of cardboard. They are soaking rags in vinegar to protect against tear gas. They are making peanut costumes to mock money politics. They are filling water balloons with paint. From wire, chain and pipe, they are making tools to shut down Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span>The Republicans are coming in two days, but the fun and the fury start now.</span></p> <p><span>The concerned, the angry, the playful and the poor are piling up in abandoned lots, in factories and on friends' couches. A movement is beginning in Philadelphia that, for hundreds, will end in a basement jail.</span></p> <p><span>In the meantime, they will fill the streets with violence, spectacle and noise. Their actions will degenerate from street festival to street-fighting, and they will paralyze this city.</span></p> <p><span>Their messages are many, but they all share one feeling--that something is very wrong with the glitzy Republican gala across town, and with the state of the American democracy that created it.</span></p> <p><span>They may be respected by some, laughed at by others and hated by a few. But above all, parading in front of the cameras that are here for the convention, they will be noticed. And for now, that is all they want.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Calm Before the Storm </b><p> </p><p></p></font>The first gathering, a rally for hundreds of progressive organizations and issues was UNITY2000, which promised--and managed to deliver--a \"peaceful, family-friendly atmosphere\" without civil disobedience.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>It transformed a quarter-mile of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, an eight-lane highway running through the center of the city, into a massive political flea market.</span></p> <p><span>Several hundred police stood in long rows between the trees lining the Parkway and watched.</span></p> <p><span>The more than two-hundred issues bandied about were diverse enough to create stark contrasts. Some demonstrators preached anarchy. Others simply preached, like the Critical Path group, which encouraged all who strolled by--black-masked punks, tie-dyed hippies and camera-happy delegates--to embrace a progressivism grounded in compassion and faith.</span></p> <p><span>Many onlookers passed over the rows of issue tables and headed straight for the street's center, where the largest attractions held sway over the largest crowds.</span></p> <p><span>They gathered around the peculiar contraptions placed at a few points along the parkway: rectangular wooden frames hung with large cans and bottles, metal bars, and anything else that could be banged on, all dappled in a dozen colors.</span></p> <p><span>A handful of demonstrators circled the structure in a dance-percussion frenzy, surrounded by a mixed crowd, some dancing, some staring.</span></p> <p><span>Philadelphia artist Melina Hammer was taking a break from clanging. She sat on the grass median of the Parkway, joining others in a late-afternoon languor. They had been marching and rallying for more almost six hours that balmy Sunday.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm here because the Democrats and Republicans are hand in hand. They don't show different beliefs. The majority isn't being represented.\"</span></p> <p><span>And the music?</span></p> <p><span>\"It's for unity, a way of experiencing the spiritual satisfaction of being together through music,\" she explained.</span></p> <p><span>Further down the median, a man standing before a 30-foot-long inflatable missile shouting about America's defense spending saw his audience slowly dwindle. Many snuck away to catch glimpses of Corpzilla and its muddy message.</span></p> <p><span>Corpzilla is a flatbed truck with a mud-wrestling ring and a cab transformed through paint and papier mache into a flaming dragon head.</span></p> <p><span>Corpzilla's organizers say it is also a protest against the corruption of politics by corporate and special interest money, one of the foremost complaints in Philadelphia this week, a cause around which both Republican Senator John S. McCain and artist Melina Hammer can rally.</span></p> <p><span>On the truck's bed, in a shallow pool of mud, a rather canine-looking man with a mud-caked beard grappled with a fellow in a two-piece bathing suit.</span></p> <p><span>A woman jumped from the platform and cleared the muck from her cheeks, revealing elaborate tigress facepaint above her red sequined tanktop.</span></p> <p><span>She later identified herself as Rebecca Myers, and said she helped create Corpzilla in Washington, D.C.</span></p> <p><span>She discussed the Corpzilla agenda.</span></p> <p><span>\"The point is, it's a joke. The point is they're just the same, Democrats and Republicans. We're here to say the two-party system isn't in favor of the people.\"</span></p> <p><span>Myers paused and looked back to the truck with a smile. \"We're just fucking around.\"</span></p> <p><span>Before she could speak further, she was interrupted by the dog-man's growling challenges to the audience.</span></p> <p><span>\"Who wants to wrestle?\" he asked. \"Who wants to wrestle?\"</span></p> <p><span>There were no takers.</span></p> <p><span>The worry that spectacles like Corpzilla would eclipse the issues on display didn't bother a lot of people at UNITY2000, where the emphasis was on fun and exposure.</span></p> <p><span>\"Progressives don't have to be boring,\" said Leon Oboler, organizer of the carnival-like rally.</span></p> <p><span>\"Why?\" he continued. \"Because that's what we're doing, we're having fun together.\"</span></p> <p><span>Oboler then grabbed a long list with contact information for each of the causes represented at the rally. He told assembled reporters to call every one of them, to listen to what each group had to say about the issues it campaigned for.</span></p> <p><span>But not all participants in the rally were as interested in social justice as those on Oboler's list. Interspersed between the tables advocating capitalism's overthrow were red and white carnival tents offering three dollar cups of lemonade, four dollar pretzels and \"all beef diggity dogs.\"</span></p> <p><span>The capitalists were at work.</span></p> <p><span>The frankfurter intrusion was, according to to Oboler, an unfortunate result of the compromise with the city--which made the rally contingent on, among other things, the vendor's presence.</span></p> <p><span>The hot dogs sold briskly, despite the remonstrance of a porcine Jiminy Cricket--a People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals protester in a pig suit shouting slogans at waiting patrons.</span></p> <p><span>The pig complained about the lack of vegetarian food, a preferred diet for many forward-thinking activists, and vented against the UNITY2000 board.</span></p> <p><span>\"The organizers haven't even tried to stop the scandalous animal slaughter industry,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>The deal with the city did, however, maintain peace throughout the day. The only injury occurred when an abortion-rights protester jumped in front of a slowly moving camper which served as headquarters for an anti-abortion group. The religious crowd had spent the day further up the Ben Franklin Parkway in a counter-protest holding \"Abortion Kills Children\" signs, shouting at UNITY2000 demonstrators, and pointing out communists for passing members of the press.</span></p> <p><span>The rally ended promptly at 4 o' clock so the city could avoid paying police overtime. Sanitation crews came in, sweeping up the littered \"Free Mumia Abu-Jamal\" signs and pamphlets marked \"Living Wage\" that detailed the plight of poorly-paid workers.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>The Truce </b><p> </p><p></p></font>With the beginning of the Republican National Convention on Monday came the end of sanctioned protests and the threat of unrest. A poverty rights group, the Kensington Welfare Rights Union (KWRU), had for weeks been publicizing the March for Economic Human Rights, which, without a permit, brought the potential for mass arrests and police confrontation.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>The group gathered in an abandoned lot in derelict Northern Philadelphia at a camp called \"Bushville,\" where march participants and city homeless bivouacked during the week.</span></p> <p><span>The KWRU organizers planned Bushville both as a high-visibility reminder of poverty and a disparaging comparison between George W. Bush and Herbert Hoover. During Hoover's presidency the Depression struck, sending the poor into shantytowns which they dubbed \"Hoovervilles\" out of contempt for the president. With both sides hoping to avoid any ugliness, KWRU lawyers and police officials negotiated a minute-to-minute truce as the march moved slowly from Bushville's Northern Philadelphia ghetto toward the main downtown thoroughfares connecting Center City to the First Union Center, where the convention would begin that night.</span></p> <p><span>As officials on both sides, protester and police, agreed to cooperate, the city shut down Broad Street, making an open road for the demonstrators and hour-long traffic delays.</span></p> <p><span>The protest annoyed many. A man in a white polo shirt, the casual Republican uniform, stood near the open door of his green BMW sedan talking speaking on a cell phone.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm a half-hour late for lunch,\" he said, sweating freely.</span></p> <p><span>A woman walking between the spectators who crowded the sidewalks along the mile-long parade eyed the parade, and turning to her friend asked, \"My God, can you smell the body odor coming off those people.\"</span></p> <p><span>The march formed a mile-long line of demonstrators two abreast in another day of balmy heat down the center of Broad Street, the largest East-West thoroughfare in the city.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the heat and possibility of arrest, the contingent was large and multiform. Young, black-masked anarchists walked with an upside-down American flag in step behind families marching with young children.</span></p> <p><span>Demonstrating with his wife and nine-year old son was Tom Hirschl, a professor of sociology at Cornell University. His was the rally's common theme: America's prosperity was driving a dangerously wide economic gap between the rich and the poor.</span></p> <p><span>\"The government is just responding to the economy; it's going along with it, not trying to control it,\" he said. \"The policies of the leaders of this country are creating more homelessness.\"</span></p> <p><span>Not all the protesters shared Hirschl's calm, measured speech. Racing back and forth between the protesters in the middle of the street and the many spectators who clogged sidewalks along the route, a man with a sprawling, unkempt beard and a banner tucked under his arm screamed in onlookers' faces.</span></p> <p><span>\"Start believing in your neighbors! Stop believing in these goddamned devils!\" he shouted several times at a small group of women on the corner of Locust and Broad Streets.</span></p> <p><span>The police, who earlier that afternoon and only a few blocks away had arrested nine members of a group protesting US-sponsored training of South American paramilitaries, stood with expressionless faces and watched the marchers pass.</span></p> <p><span>One officer, about 15 feet from the nearest protester, idly drew his nightstick. A photographer rushed close to him, knelt and made ready to photograph the riot-ready policeman with nightstick drawn. The officer, noticing the man with the camera, quickly slid his baton back into his belt before the photographer could click the shutter open.</span></p> <p><span>In addition to the Philadephia police, the organizers sent their own orange-vested security forces up and down the line to maintain calm. Each KWRU member in the march had taken a non-violence pledge.</span></p> <p><span>Some of the last marchers on the line waved ghostly, 15-foot-tall puppets above their heads and an Uncle Sam on stilts danced among them with a drum corps.</span></p> <p><span>Following them closely were the police, who formed their own parade, an assembly on foot, on horseback, in armored buses with grate windows, on motorcycles, on dirt bikes and in Police Athletic League vans. The police contingent covered four lanes of Broad Street and stretched back for six blocks.</span></p> <p><span>Another man in a polo shirt walked past the mass of police and, ducking through a crowd, remarked to a few onlookers: \"All of this for high school kids? They would have been all right with one car. They had less than this for the riots after they killed Martin Luther King,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>The march made it peacefully for three miles, without any arrests or serious confrontations, to the police barriers erected across Broad Street near the First Union Center, where the vanguard had to choose between peaceful assembly in Franklin D. Roosevelt Park across the street from the Republican Convention, or a march on the convention and the hundred of police surrounding it.</span></p> <p><span>They headed for the park, and, just as Republicans from Alabama began the roll call kicking off the convention inside the First Union Center, the march ended calmly. The police saturating the area had little to do, although the city would soon find need for its marshaled forces.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>All Quiet in the Protest Pit </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Despite rumors of more aggressive protests, Tuesday morning was hot and uneventful. At the First Union Center, behind three walls of eight-foot chain-link fence, were police in cars every 30 feet. Franklin D. Roosevelt park, where the March For Economic Human Rights had ended the day before, was enclosed by another perimeter of fencing, and more police. Only one entrance, at 20th Street, remained open. At the southwest corner, more than 300 yards from the convention center across a highway, a parking lot, four more fences and hundred of police, was a fenced-in enclosure dubbed \"the protest pit\" by demonstrators. The police had planned to control demonstrators by giving them pit-time in 50-minute blocks. Media reports before had predicted the area would be the main battleground for the week's protests, the focal point of protest.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>On Tuesday afternoon, except for six plain-clothes police officers and a podium, the protest pit was empty. One speaker, Cole H. Kleitsch of the Walking Civics group, knelt off to one side and gathered his belongings after he had finished his time at the podium. He warned the audience of six police about the evils of political parties taking quotes from George Washington's 1796 farewell address, in which Washington spoke of the same theme.</span></p> <p><span>Kleitsch was not bothered by the turnout.</span></p> <p><span>\"The city was kind enough to give us the spot and so I came and did my protest,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Kleitsch was the only scheduled protester who had showed up that Tuesday. On one officer's schedule for the day before, ten groups were slated. Nine had \"no show\" written in red ink next to their names. The Greyhound Adoption Program had shown up.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's bring your own audience,\" one plainclothes officer said.</span></p> <p><span>A woman walking with her son through the park, said she had been moving along the fence for a half-hour, trying to find a way out. Several police had sent her to the enclosure, and told her police there could let her out. They could not.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's no way out? It's me and my three-year-old and we're stuck?\" she asked police.</span></p> <p><span>They directed her across the fountains and gazebos to the 20th Street entrance, and she started with child in tow.</span></p> <p><span>Two police roared past her on dirt bikes, heading for a young man who had stepped off a path onto the grass. They slid the bikes in front of and behind the boy, and told him sternly, repeatedly, to get back on the gravel trail.</span></p> <p><span>\"Where's the Swedish-American Museum?\" he asked the police.</span></p> <p><span>They both gestured at the trail, he complied, and then the police took off into a grove of trees.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>The Anarcho-Catholic Syndicate </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Most protesters Tuesday shunned the carefully controlled conditions of the First Union Center and opted instead for havoc on the open streets of downtown Philadelphia, among the high-rise hotels where most Republican Delegates stayed.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>At two in the afternoon, at the intersection of 13th and Arch Streets--just outside the Pennsylvania Convention Center that housed many convention activities--about 25 protesters, all white youths, squatted on a crosswalk with their arms linked, stopping traffic.</span></p> <p><span>Behind them, 50 police officers stood two rows deep, holding batons across their chests and staring straight ahead. Men and women in business clothes with orange armbands marked \"police\" walked around the protesters.</span></p> <p><span>Holding one post of the sign was an young woman anarchist with a shaved head and a red bandana mask. Holding the other was a nun in street clothes. She belonged to a group with signs that said, \"Catholic sisters oppose the death penalty.\"</span></p> <p><span>The anarchist shouted at the mob of press and delegates surrounding the scene. \"Can you believe this unity, man? A nun and me.\" She acknowledged that plans for Tuesday's demonstration were more aggressive than those on previous days, but would not say explicitly whether or not she planned on violence.</span></p> <p><span>\"I will not be arrested without showing that I don't believe I should be arrested,\" she said, and pointed down to a length of wire coiled around the pole she held.</span></p> <p><span>One Republican delegate looking on, Ted T. Barr, a retired police captain and sheriff from West Virginia, wasn't worried by the group.</span></p> <p><span>\"I've been to seven conventions and I've seen it all,\" Barr said.</span></p> <p><span>And although the R2K network, the protesters' organizing body, had issued a statement saying that Tuesday \"was a day to turn the tables on them and to disrupt the delegates' lives,\" Barr stood calmly a few feet from the masked woman.</span></p> <p><span>He surveyed the group.</span></p> <p><span>\"A spoiled brat will only go so far. It makes good entertainment for the conventioneers,\" Barr said.</span></p> <p><span>At that moment, two more rows of police followed by dozens of vans and patrol cars appeared at the other end of the street, boxing the demonstration between the buildings. A yellow school bus pulled up behind the police batallions who had arrived first, and a plainclothes officer told the sitting demonstrators they would be arrested in five minutes.</span></p> <p><span>The protesters got up and slinked away quickly between a photographer and a traffic signal, moving down 13th Street.</span></p> <p><span>One of the demonstration drummers, who gave his name as Drum, was left among a crowd of press, police and businesspeople.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think it was a success,\" he said. \"We stopped traffic.\"</span></p> <p><span>He then walked away, tapping idly on his empty plastic can, as the traffic began flowing smoothly down Arch Street.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Field Guide to Riots </b><p> </p><p></p></font>From the radio of a car stuck in traffic by the Arch Street demonstration, a news station listed the intersections shut down by protests.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>\"Sixteenth and Callowhill, Broad and Spruce, 15th and J.F.K., Eighth and Vine, 18th and Vine.\"</span></p> <p><span>Also over the radio, police asked all motorists to leave Center City.</span></p> <p><span>Coordinated by cellular phone and two-way radio, protesters, predominantly white and young, were traveling in bands as large as 300.</span></p> <p><span>Some burned bunting, spilled garbage, vandalized police cars and threw unidentified fluids in the faces of the police. Then, there were the black-suited members of groups like Black Bloc and the Upside Down Clowns whose agenda appeared to be petty vandalism and Republican harassment outside the Doubletree Hotel. One group which denied being part of any protest and said it was a jogging club, ran the streets in red dresses, flipping cartwheels in what appeared to be a protest against underwear. Another group, called \"Billionaires For Bush (or Gore)\" -one wearing top hats and brocaded dresses--lampooned the high hand of money in politics. Their slogan: \"Because inequality isn't growing fast enough.\"</span></p> <p><span>Other protestors were doctrinaires: the death penalty, poverty, political venality. To draw the cameras to their signs and slogans, they would run crepe paper around traffic lights and street signs at an intersection, forming a quick square into which they would jump and begin the chants they would use until their arrest.</span></p> <p><span>\"Whose street? Our street!\"</span></p> <p><span>There were those, too, who had no affiliation and just showed up wherever trouble was.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Sleeping Dragons Shut Down City </b><p> </p><p></p></font>As the evening came and conventioneers across town prepared to hear retired general Norman H. Schwartzkopf's remarks on military readiness, the splintered groups coalesced around a few large demonstrations, mostly at blocked intersections. At Spruce and Broad streets, about 300 protesters had gathered in the center of one of the city's busiest streets and the main route from the hotels to the convention.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Police surrounded the scene. For the first time, they appeared in riot helmets. They stretched Nike golf gloves over their baton hands as they moved out from the yellow school buses toward the intersection. Thirty-five protesters linked arms in the center of the street.</span></p> <p><span>Eight were chained together by devices called \"sleeping dragons,\" two-foot long lengths of PVC pipe covered with a thick layer of duct tape. Inside each tube was a bolt and chain which locked protesters' wrist together inside the pipe.</span></p> <p><span>Police methodically secured protesters arms behind their backs, wrote number for reference on their arms and lined them up to be arrested and dragged to waiting Philadelphia Sheriff's Office buses.</span></p> <p><span>Other demonstrators, gathered on the sidewalk outside of the police line on the, applauded the protesters as police lifted them by their biceps and put them in the buses.</span></p> <p><span>Many arrestees smiled like martyrs, or joked with police, who responded cordially. One man hopped on one foot between the police escorting him to the bus, kicking the other leg out in a black boot can-can. The plain-clothes officer by his side smiled.</span></p> <p><span>The police knelt and worked for hours to separate the prone demonstrators who were chained together, finally freeing their hands, which emerged from the pipes with chains still dangling around sweat-soaked layers of athletic tape.</span></p> <p><span>With the central square clear, they turned to face the protesters and spectators who had watched for three hours as the demonstration slowly dissolved, and pushed them slowly back down the side-streets.</span></p> <p><span>One man tried to break through the line, claiming to be a member of the press. An officer told him several times to back away, unsuccessfully.</span></p> <p><span>The policeman then, keeping his drawn baton to the side, walked at the man and, with his chest, pressed him against the Plexiglas bus barrier and moved his face in to a kissing distance.</span></p> <p><span>\"Do not test me today, sir,\" the officer said. \"Do not test me.\"</span></p> <p><span>The man did not.

{"title": "Dollars From Death | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>NEW YORK--Last week, a Concorde flight departing from Charles de Gaulle Airport crashed into a Gonesse hotel, tragically killing 114 people.</span></p> <p><span>When Americans discovered the news on their television sets, radio stations and informative websites across the nation, they responded with fear, panic, grief and sorrow.</span></p> <p><span>But the word to describe the emotions of my co-workers at a national cable television station was jubilant.</span></p> <p><span>The same polarity of emotional reaction took place the week before as well. A teenager, described only by his black hair with \"dyed purple tips,\" had opened gunfire in the cafeteria of a high school conducting summer school classes. Thankfully no one was hurt because the shots had been fired towards the ceiling, but my co-worker still thought the event was \"fantastic.\" That afternoon we had already booked Gavin de Becker, a leading expert in predicting violent behavior and the author of The Gift of Fear: Survival Signs that Protect Us From Violence. The show's senior producer was overjoyed that audiences would believe that we had managed to spontaneously book De Becker during the two hour window between the shooting and our live taping.</span></p> <p><span>When I brought my shock at his reaction to his attention, another producer brushed the incident aside, explaining, \"Oh, you'll get used to that around here. We know that it's disgusting and inexcusable, but it's our job. We have to think like that.\"</span></p> <p><span>Children take up arms against their classmates and the first thing that crosses a television producer's mind is ratings. A supersonic jet spews huge flames from its tail as it dives into Hotelissimo and the news industry breathes a thankful prayer that the dreadful summer news drought is finally over.</span></p> <p><span>In contrast, presidential candidate Texas Gov. George W. Bush was probably cursing the jet crash--not because of its tragic depth but because it had stolen his media-driven spotlight. Although news leaks and leads had been circulating since the Saturday beforehand, that Tuesday was also the day that Bush formally announced former Secretary of Defense Richard B. Cheney as his Republican running mate. Brian Williams, the anchor for MSNBC's coverage of the Concorde crash, practically apologized to Bush when the network returned to their coverage of the crash rather than air the remainder of Bush's formal announcement.</span></p> <p><span>Motivated by fear-driven curiosity, the audiences watching the news at home, listening on the radio and reading the news stories posted on the web attentively collected bits and pieces of information about the crash. Motivated by financial pressure, the news networks worked tirelessly to stretch a tragic story with a heart-wrenching ending into a four-hour broadcast.</span></p> <p><span>But the news of the day and the updated details of the tragedy had to be delivered to the American public in some manner. And that manner was a form of business--media business. It was the job of the producers, anchors, personalities and commentators to report the Concorde crash, as it was their duty to educate the American public about Cheney's Congressional voting record, the environmental efforts being made by Ford Motor Industries and the failed Camp David talks. Whereas outsiders to the industry interpret news as a mere presentation of information, insiders depend on tragedies, celebrations and surprises for basic levels of subsistence. Insiders are not at the liberty to view events with an emotional, sympathetic eye.</span></p> <p><span>The assumed purpose of an internship is to experiment working within a professional field. From the vantage point of a relatively naive 20-year-old, I only know what I dreaded to be part of my future profession, namely boredom, fatigue and monotony. I have long wanted to pursue a career in journalism in part because the industry was constantly changing and moving forward yet at the same time able to balance itself by looking to the past.</span></p> <p><span>After my experience this summer, I better understand what I dread about the working world: Even if the work is glamorously unrepetitive, it is still unappealingly impersonal. Media work converts one's success into dollar signs and another's loss into high ratings--it takes the drama and glitz away from the changes and events that should spark our sentiments and emotions. The media plays an important, integral role in our society, no doubt. But the toll that it takes on those who micromanage the industry may be too much for me to bear.</span></p> <p><span><i>Jordana R.

{"title": "Spinning the Debates | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Senior aides to the Gore and Bush campaigns will sit down with the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates tomorrow to finalize the schedule and formats for a series of televised forums likely to be held early next month. It is clear, however, that the only party interested in haggling is that of the Texas governor. Vice President Al Gore '69 has rightly embraced the Commission's original proposal, which called for three debates at college campuses in Boston, North Carolina and St. Louis in early October. These debates, independently sponsored by the Commission, would be broadcast by all three major television networks and would maximize prime-time exposure.</span></p> <p><span>This recommendation differs sharply from the Bush campaign's counter-proposal, which would have included at least two network-sponsored debates, one on NBC and the other on CNN. As a political calculation, such a proposal is understandable: It could be politically disadvantageous for an inexperienced debater to meet a four-campaign veteran head-on, and Bush may prefer to first meet Gore in front of a smaller audience.</span></p> <p><span>But Bush's ill-fated attempts last week to twist the words of his rival are inexcusable. Gore might have been willing to debate \"anytime, anyplace, anywhere,\" but such debates only have meaning if they are seen by a large segment of the American populace (not possible through the cable-only CNN) and if they are initially broadcast live and unedited (not possible under the format of NBC's \"Meet the Press\").</span></p> <p><span>The Bush campaign has now shown welcome signs of compromising with the Commission. Nevertheless, a few hurdles still remain. Most notably, the Texas governor has expressed unwillingness to debate on the UMass-Boston campus. That location, Bush's aides have commented, is too close to the John F. Kennedy Memorial Library, hostile territory because it honors a Democratic president. We are puzzled why such an association would necessarily hurt Bush's debating performance any more than a debate in front of the Lincoln Memorial would hurt that of Gore.</span></p> <p><span>It is our hope that both sides reach an agreement in tomorrow's meeting that incorporates, at the least, three debates that are sponsored by an independent organization and broadcast to the widest possible national audience. At least one vice-presidential debate should be similarly structured.</span></p> <p><span>After these televised forums, both candidates should make every effort to appear jointly on national television. Conversations with Tim Russert and Larry King--along with appearances on late-night talk shows, Oprah and MTV--certainly have their place in presidential politics, but only if they are offered as additions to, rather than as substitutes for, fair and legitimate debates.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Yale's Renaissance? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>They are getting smug in New Haven.</span></p> <p><span>Of the four men running for president and vice president in the 2000 election, three of them went to Yale. Both Republican candidates, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former Wyoming representative Richard B. Cheney, as well as Democratic vice presidential nominee Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, are sons of Eli. Only one candidate, Al Gore '69, went to Harvard College.</span></p> <p><span>In public relations terms, this is the greatest thing to happen to Yale since the invention of bulletproof glass. The national media doted on the coincidence this summer, chronicling Bush's days as head of a fraternity and Lieberman's tenure as chairman of the Yale Daily News. Former Yale chaplain William Sloane Coffin, who most of us know only as the inspiration for the Doonesbury character Scott Sloane, wrote an op-ed in The New York Times glorifying the \"strong social consciousness\" that prevailed at the Yale of Bush and Lieberman's day. Yale of those days, we're to believe, bred men for greatness.</span></p> <p><span>Far be it from us, of course, to deny Yale its moment in the sun. Lord knows, they don't come too often. We can take comfort in the assurance that if Gore wins in November, as the polls now predict, things will return to normal. And even if Bush wins, it will take more than a president or two to cure Yale's well-deserved inferiority complex.</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, the age-old rivalry is heating up on the campaign trail. Earlier this month, the Eli-ticket of Bush and Cheney were overheard referring to New York Times reporter (and former Crimson president) Adam Clymer '58 as a \"major league asshole.\"</span></p> <p><span>To many voters, the idea of the Harvard-Yale rivalry (which curiously seems to be referred to as the \"Yale-Harvard\" rivalry in every publication on earth except The Crimson) being played out in national politics will seem sickening. Both universities represent wealth, privilege and elitism to most Americans. Harvard and Yale are about as status quo as you can get. Luckily, for voters who believe both candidates are pawns of the powers that be, there is an alternative: They can cast a protest vote for Green Party candidate Ralph Nader. He, after all, went to Princeton.</span></p>"}
{"title": "A Call to Serve | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>\"So to the young people watching tonight, I say: This is your time to make new the life of our world. We need your help to rekindle the spirit of America. Believe in our country. We believe in you.\"</span></p> <p><span>These words, delivered by Vice President Al Gore '69 near the end of his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, were but meager inspiration for one of the most politically uninvolved generations in history. The phrases were unremarkable--making new the life of the world gets repetitive every four years--and seemed out of line with a family-centered rhetoric and platform that paid little attention to young adults.</span></p> <p><span>On the other hand, Texas Gov. George W. Bush's acceptance speech contained no similar apostrophe to the young, except for a promise that Social Security reform would let younger workers accumulate \"sound, responsible investments\" into a retirement nest egg \"over 30 or 40 years.\" Perhaps both parties have written off the youth vote this year, choosing to aim at demographics that have less apathy, more concrete demands and bigger pocketbooks to vote with. After all, in the 1996 presidential election, only one third of those 18 to 24 years old cast a ballot.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, politicians have misread the attitude of younger voters. The problem today is not apathy: it's distrust. Today's youth do not shy away from the problems of their community; instead, they shy away from politics as a solution to those problems, choosing to help through private initiative and community service with a dedication that could, with some effort, be diverted into the public sphere.</span></p> <p><span>A recent and groundbreaking study conducted by students affiliated with the Institute of Politics documented this commitment to public service. After surveying 800 students nationwide, the study's authors found that only one of six college students had joined a political or issues-related organization, and less than one in fifteen had chosen to volunteer on a campaign--yet more than half had decided to give back to their community by participating in public service.</span></p> <p><span>But this surge of public service is combined with a strong distaste for the political process. The vast majority of students--85 percent--feel that voluntary action is more effective than political engagement at solving local problems, and a full 60 percent have come to believe that the same is true at the national level. Politics has become a dirty word; those who enter the political process are labeled as self-serving rather than committed by a margin of three to one. Community service sometimes brings instant gratification, with plenty of friendly faces and beaming kids; political involvement is a thankless task in which good work is easily lost amid petty differences and the lust for power.</span></p> <p><span>There is no reason to sneer at commitment to the community. But to think that government action can be effectively replaced with private initiative is dangerously shortsighted. (Remember the successes of that great champion of voluntary action, Herbert Hoover.) For all its faults, politics is also a means by which the mighty power of government can be turned to good ends rather than bad. For young Americans to neglect political involvement in favor of private measures, deciding not to vote because they gave at the office, is to invite those with special interests to raid the public treasury and subvert the public good.</span></p> <p><span>Phillips Brooks House is not the White House: No matter how many cases the Small Claims Advisory Service takes on, it couldn't counteract another 75% cut in the Legal Services budget from the GOP Congress, nor could ExperiMentors train a new generation of scientists from schools with inadequate lab equipment. A personal commitment to the environment won't veto laws drafted by industry lobbyists; only a presidential commitment can do that. Government doesn't need to be the only solution, but it must be part of the solution--or we will quickly find it, as the saying goes, to be part of the problem.</span></p> <p><span>So one must wonder what politics might look like if young voters were offered more than appeals to vague tasks of renewal or to raw self-interest--especially in an election like this one, where there is such a stark contrast on issues like the environment, equal rights and social justice that attract the energy of new voters. Imagine if the candidates at the conventions had read the IOP survey, had listened to its recommendations and had said:</span></p> <p><span>\"To the young people watching tonight, I say:</span></p> <p><span>\"Many have called you an apathetic generation. I know that is untrue. I know you are committed to helping others through public service. That is why my administration will be firmly dedicated to opening the political process to you, your involvement and your concerns. I promise that the second bill that I will send to Congress--after campaign finance reform--will create for you new avenues of participation in the political process. It will streamline the process for voter registration and for absentee ballots, so you can vote more easily from college; it will offer stipend awards to those who take summer jobs to work in the political process; and it will provide additional scholarships and college loan forgiveness programs for students who promise to enter public service. It will offer you a chance to make politics part of your public service, an opportunity to use the full power of government to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable.</span></p> <p><span>To the young people watching tonight, I say: This is your call to serve.\"</span></p> <p><span>Would it work?</span></p> <p><span><i>Stephen E.

{"title": "Religion and Politics | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>This has been a banner week for American Jews. When Al Gore '69 announced Tuesday that he had selected Connecticut Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as his running mate, a storm of press coverage heralded the \"bold\" and \"unprecedented\" decision. Ordinarily cynical pundits praised Gore warmly for promoting tolerance and diversity in choosing Lieberman, the first Jew to run for vice president on a major party ticket. Jews across the country were said to be celebrating at the news. \"From the kosher restaurants of Manhattan's Upper West Side to the corner shuls of Los Angeles' Pico-Robertson district,\" proclaimed the Los Angeles Times, \"conversations on Monday turned to a single thought: He's one of ours.\"</span></p> <p><span>The pride that many Jews take in Lieberman's selection is expansive and genuine. But the media's single-minded focus on the senator's Judaism is unusual, to say the least. The possible addition of another Jew to the upper echelons of government hardly seems like news. The Clinton administration in particular has promoted significant numbers of Jews to positions almost as high as the vice presidency: Many of his top Cabinet deputies, like Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin '61, come from Jewish backgrounds. Both of Clinton's appointees to the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, are Jewish. But hardly anyone focused on their Judaism when these men and women were tapped, and no one cited them as symbols of diversity or tolerance. With Lieberman it's different--the word \"historic\" seems permanently welded to his name, like the W. in George W. Bush.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe that's because the vice presidency is, technically, an executive position--stereotypically Jews have been regarded as advisors and assistants rather than as leaders, and the vice president is at least potentially a leader. But a more obvious explanation is at hand. In a country where the vast majority of Jews are Reform, Conservative or non-practicing, Lieberman is Orthodox. As even Americans who have never met a Jew in their lives know by now, Lieberman keeps kosher, does not campaign on the Sabbath and walks home from the Capitol on Saturdays. Practically alone among Jewish politicians, he laces his speeches with references to his faith--at the official announcement rally in Nashville, Lieberman opened with a quote from Chronicles and gave repeated thanks to God, \"maker of all miracles\"--a technique more familiar to a Christian Coalition Republican than the average Jewish Democrat. Jews may be well represented in the upper ranks of government, but not Orthodox Jews: With the exception of Dr. Laura Schlessinger, Lieberman stands alone as the most prominent Orthodox Jew in America, and he is certainly the most widely respected.</span></p> <p><span>The spotlight on Lieberman illuminates a subtle tension in American Jewry that is often overlooked by the national media. Judaism is both an ethnicity and a religion, but the most prominent Jews in American life usually embody the former quality more than the latter. Jewish senators like Barbara Boxer or Charles E. Schumer '71 rarely quote from Chronicles, or any part of the Bible. Seinfeld, Kramer and Elaine never set foot in a synagogue. There are few rabbis or religious Jews who enter public debates with the forcefulness of Jerry Falwell or Cardinal O'Connor. But Lieberman is different: His most memorable political moments, his campaign against Hollywood indecency and his condemnation of President Clinton during the Lewinsky scandal, were clearly motivated by his abiding faith. Moreover, he is outspoken in identifying that faith as different from the Christian majority. The Gore-Lieberman campaign has not attempted to soft-peddle his Judaism, to put it mildly (witness the senator's endearingly lame joke about Gore's \"chutzpah\"). Lieberman is not an ethnic Jew or a religious Jew; he is both.</span></p> <p><span>This dual identity may explain why commentators have had such a hard time pinning Lieberman down ideologically. Within hours, Gore was said variously to be moving towards the center with his selection and to be placating his party's left-wing base. The senator's record has inspired very different interpretations. Rabbi Michael Lerner, the editor of Tikkun magazine, groused that Lieberman was \"bad for the Jews and bad for America\" because of his conservative stances on school vouchers and Social Security and his hawkish enthusiasm for the military. And Lieberman is unquestionably conservative--for an ethnic Jew. Meanwhile, some Orthodox Jews wondered aloud whether his liberal support for gay rights and his unwaveringly abortion rights voting record made him less authentically Orthodox. On these issues, Lieberman is well to the left of most religious Jews.</span></p> <p><span>Lieberman has a chance to fuse these diverse strains and overcome Americans' preconceived ideas about Jews, especially Orthodox Jews. Ironically, those preconceived notions may be strongest among the same liberal ethnic Jews who are themselves so well-represented. The day after the announcement, I asked a Jewish friend what his mother thought of the choice. She was pleased, he said, but wary, because she considers Orthodox Judaism \"essentially a cult.\" Even more open-minded ethnic Jews might feel alienated by Lieberman's strongly religious language and values. He may encounter that kind of skepticism next week in Los Angeles, where in heavily Jewish Hollywood, Judaism is less a religion than a state of mind.</span></p> <p><span>For those Americans, and those Jews, who consider Orthodoxy synonymous with narrow-mindedness and intolerance (paging Dr. Laura), Lieberman has a chance to set the record straight.

{"title": "What's All This About Warming? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Three weeks ago, it was snowing. In late April. These last few days, though, the summer heat has been downright oppressive. One could almost sit languidly under a tree, sipping lemonade and watching throngs of beautiful bronzed bodies darting about in carefree games of Frisbee or volleyball. Almost--because the minute you actually started enjoying this come-from-behind sunshine, your conscience should have rebelled. What are we arrogant homo sapiens doing, reaping the sweet fruits of our heinous interference with weather systems and our unconscionable rape of the global climate?</span></p> <p><span>That's right. You have a moral responsibility to get off that field, move to Washington, and campaign without pause for the less-than-sunny personality of Al Gore '69. Republican or Democrat, libertarian or Independent: it doesn't matter. Only Gore can convince those reactionary corporate pawns in the Senate to ratify the prudent Kyoto Protocol. Only Gore has written a book--a whole book!--on the subject, refreshingly entitled Earth in the Balance. Only Gore, therefore, can save civilization from the preeminent crisis now facing it, climactic Armageddon precipitated by human-driven global warming.</span></p> <p><span>You should trust Gore. Since he's actually written a book on the subject, he is familiar with all the relevant data. He has surely heard of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), sponsored by the UN itself. And he must have seen Bert Bolin, chair of the IPCC, admit in debate that the vast majority of warming this century took place before 1940. Aaah, the good old days--so many cars on the road that Henry Ford even let you \"choose between black and black.\"</span></p> <p><span>Believe in Gore. Having invented the Internet, he is no doubt up to speed on all the goings-on at NASA. He has seen the data amassed by U.S. satellites, showing quite clearly that since 1979 there has been absolutely no warming in the lower atmosphere. He is well aware that such data correspond almost perfectly to those gathered independently by weather balloons. And he understands that surface measurements of temperature can be notoriously unreliable, given the thermal \"noise\" modern cities emit. But Gore, sipping his iced tea as he leafs through Earth in the Balance, remembers these things selectively, understanding them when he wants to.</span></p> <p><span>Viva Gore! A liberal Harvard education under his belt, this son of Tennessee (or is it Washington, D.C.?) enjoys staying up with the scientific community. Aides have reportedly seen him poring over back issues of Science magazine in the Congressional library. His favorite article to appear in Science is likely the relatively recent \"Greenhouse Forecasting Still Cloudy,\" which reported that \"many climate experts caution that it is not at all clear yet that human activities have begun to warm the planet--or how bad greenhouse warming will be when it arrives.\"</span></p> <p><span>Gore might also want to check out the Heidelberg Appeal. Signed by 4000 plus scientists whose ranks number 70 Nobel Prize winners, the Appeal makes clear that regulating human output of greenhouse gases is, at least at this junction, not justified.</span></p> <p><span>How does Gore do it? How does he manage simultaneously to know all the relevant data and publish alarmist, unscientific screeds such as Earth in the Balance? Without taking away from his mental acuity, one might note that Gore has had eight years to hone his own understanding of what the multivalent meaning of \"is\" is. Make such semiotic slop the basis of your metaphysical system, and it's easy enough to see how what is actually a neat correlation between sunspot activity and global warming is, and is not; how today's warming hysteria is, and is not like the analogous \"the-glaciers-are-coming\" panic of 20 years ago.</span></p> <p><span>For those of us not well versed enough in philosophy to master such a system of contradiction, however, one thing alone is clear. Amidst all the talk about warming, the only thing that needs cooling is Gore, and his environmental brethren's, heads.</span></p>"}

He gave the University $1 million for the construction of a computer network to push Harvard in the right direction. He also arranged for the company he headed to sell networking equipment to the University at cost. This is the backbone of today's campus network.</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't think [the Faculty of Arts and Sciences] FAS had enough appreciation for what was ahead,\" Ludwick says.</span></p> <p><span>While Ludwick says he could bring a technology perspective to the Board of Overseers, he says he has much more to offer than just that.</span></p> <p><span>\"I would view my perspective as a generalist,\" Ludwick says. \"I wouldn't bring in a particular pre-defined agenda.\"</span></p> <p><span>Ludwick knows Harvard well.

{"title": "The Real McCain? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>This past primary season, many people had perceptions of Senator John S. McCain (R-Ariz.) that were simply laughable. Some thought that he was pro-choice. Others thought that he was the more \"liberal\" of the two major Republican candidates. But at least everyone knew the one crucial thing to understand about John McCain: His alleged genuineness. The opposite of the fast-talking politicians, McCain was a maverick and someone who spoke from the heart with his \"straight talk.\" But a May 9th smoke-filled room summit with Republican nominee Texas Gov. George W. Bush may finally reveal the truth about one of the most brilliant political con-jobs of the modern era.</span></p> <p><span>McCain and Bush have agreed in principal on an agenda for this meeting. Bush is expected to ask McCain if he wants to be considered as a Vice Presidential candidate. The duo will also speak about McCain endorsing Bush or at least somehow becoming more involved in the campaign. And while it would appear unlikely that the meeting would yield the formation of a Bush-McCain ticket, the odds of a mutually beneficial political marriage seem better than even right now.</span></p> <p><span>By welcoming McCain into the campaign, Bush wins by attracting some of the McCain voters. McCain wins as well. Let's not kid ourselves here; this guy wants to be president in the worst way. Right now he's making the same calculations as any smart pol would do. He realizes that the biggest reason why he lost is because he did not have internal party support. Selling himself out to show party loyalty will bring him the crucial institutional backing he needs if Bush loses and a 2004 bid is on his mind.</span></p> <p><span>But that is exactly what this meeting means for McCain. It provides conclusive proof that he is nothing more than another politician with a King Kong-sized ego and not Tarzan riding in on a rope swing to save the nation from special interests and corruption.</span></p> <p><span>If Bush does not change his stance on many key issues in this campaign and McCain comes out in support for him to any degree, McCain is doing more than abandoning whatever integrity he has. He is also abandoning the voters who believed this message enough to cast their ballots for him. The move toward Bush constitutes the typical move made by a top challenger to the nominee. And McCain received the bi-partisan cult following he had for being atypical. The conventional political two-step could easily backfire by exposing him as just another disingenuous ego-filled presidential hopeful willing to sell himself for his career.</span></p> <p><span>John McCain spent the past year trying to show the differences between him and Bush. So now when it behooves him, he casts those marked differences aside? This certainly doesn't sound like the white knight of the government corruption fight. But upon further review it seems consistent with the John McCain that exists beneath the veil of heroism with which the media adorned him.</span></p> <p><span>This is the guy who almost got kicked out of the Senate for his role in a campaign donation scandal. But of course later he apologized and fought tirelessly for campaign finance reform and a government unbeholden to special interests.</span></p> <p><span>It is also the same guy who first suggested during the South Carolina primary that the state should be allowed to fly the Confederate flag on their capital. But as recently as last month, he decided that South Carolina should take down their Confederate flag--on the heels of the South Carolina primary where he said exactly the opposite. Then on April 19 in Columbia, South Carolina, McCain  said that he \"feared that if I answered honestly, I could not win in the South Carolina primary. So, I chose to compromise my principles. I broke my promise to always tell the truth.\" In short, McCain publicly stated that he lied about his feelings on an issue to help him win an election but again came out with an apology after the fact.</span></p> <p><span>Now McCain may come out on the team of George W. Bush only months after running ads against him in South Carolina that equated him with President Clinton. Will he just apologize again later saying he did it to put himself in better position for a second presidential bid? That remains to be seen. But if the results of the Bush-McCain tea party are in any way as predicted, we ought not to view it as an aberration from the norm but as his most flagrant waffle yet and absolute proof of his real agenda.</span></p> <p><span>America wanted an honest, principled candidate after the eight-year reign of the double-speak king. So they ignored these truths for a long time. But involvement in the Bush candidacy seems impossible to ignore. So where did all that straight talk go, John? I guess to quote the President, that depends on your definition of the word straight.</span></p> <p><span><i>Brad R. Sohn '02 is a government concentrator in Kirkland House.

When our grand domestic and international challenges are also intertwined. We should neither bemoan nor naively idealize this new reality. We should deal with it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Gore focused on the concept of \"forward engagement,\" a policy which advocates preventive measures by the United States to stop conflicts before they start in areas of national interest.</span></p> <p><span>\"We need a new security agenda for the global age based on forward engagement,\" Gore said. \"Isolationism and protectionism were dangerously wrong in the industrial age--and they are still wrong and even more dangerous in this new global age.\"</span></p> <p><span>Beyond broad foreign policy goals, the vice president spoke about specific issues, advocating that America engage with former Cold War adversaries and commit to bringing Africa into the world economic community.</span></p> <p><span>He talked most often about China, stressing his commitment to the Clinton administration's \"One China\" policy, aimed at eventual reconciliation between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. He also called for bringing China into the World Trade Organization (WTO) and permanently normalizing trade relations.</span></p> <p><span>Gore said the best way to foster democratic reform and curb human rights abuses in China is by building close political and economic ties rather than containment.</span></p> <p><span>\"It is wrong to isolate and demonize China--to build a wall when we need to build a bridge,\" Gore said.</span></p> <p><span>While Bush also supports bringing China into the WTO, Gore said the Republican supports current legislation that would inflame tensions across the Taiwan Strait.</span></p> <p><span>Gore spent the last part of his address attacking Bush's foreign policy, which he called \"noticeably blank.\" He claimed his opponent was not prepared in foreign affairs.</span></p> <p><span>\"From what we can tell of his foreign policy, Governor Bush does not prepare us to meet the grand challenges of both the classic and new security agendas,\" Gore said.</span></p> <p><span>Gore associated Bush with the views of Republican congressional leaders like Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and Senator Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), whom he dubbed \"neo-isolationists.\"</span></p> <p><span>Pointing to the failure of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a measure to prohibit all testing of nuclear weapons that was defeated by Republicans in the Senate, Gore questioned whether Bush would distance himself from members of his party.</span></p> <p><span>\"Governor Bush joined with the isolationist, partisan Republican majority in Congress in opposing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,\" Gore said. \"He chose politics over principle.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bush campaign officials lost no time in responding to Gore's attacks.</span></p> <p><span>\"The governor has not said that Russia and China should be enemies; in fact he has said that China is a competitor, and we should reach out to Russia,\" Bush foreign policy adviser Condoleezza Rice told The New York Times. \"It is very much like the vice president to distort [Bush's] record.\"</span></p>"}

Currently, none of these nations has a reliable long-range missile that could strike the U.S., and North Korea is the only one to have test-launched a long-range missile, which failed in its single launch attempt. Due to the efforts of Ambassador William Perry, North Korea has agreed to halt testing as long as negotiations with the U.S. proceed.</span></p> <p><span>Only one nation--Russia--can destroy civilization as we know it in the U.S. Only one other nation--China--can readily increase its nuclear arsenal in response to U.S. missile defense. The U.S. should be more concerned now about reducing nuclear arms with those nations than about so-called rogues that present minimal nuclear threats.</span></p> <p><span>Because the offense can more easily build weapons to counter the defense, the ABM treaty placed strict limits on missile defense, specifically preventing defense of a whole nation. It, therefore, set bounds on the nuclear arms race during the Cold War and continues to foster nuclear arms reductions.</span></p> <p><span>Publicly, Russia opposes ABM treaty changes and has linked further nuclear arms reductions to preservation of the treaty. Administration officials, however, feel that with enough pressure, Russia will be amenable to treaty modifications.</span></p> <p><span>The document leaked to the New York Times and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists reveals that the administration has repeatedly tried to reassure Russia that its nuclear deterrent will remain viable even after the final phase of the proposed NMD system, which could include up to 250 missile interceptors by 2010.</span></p> <p><span>While this analysis provides some reassurance to Russia, which would probably be able to deploy more than 1,000 strategic warheads throughout the next ten years, such defenses are still dangerous. With a missile defense in the U.S., Russia will be more likely to keep its weapons on high alert, knowing that the U.S. can probably shoot down some of its warheads. This scenario increases the chances of an accidental nuclear war. In fact, the leaked document acknowledges that Russian nuclear weapons will remain on high alert.</span></p> <p><span>Because Russia's nuclear weapons infrastructure continues to crumble, some American conservatives, such as Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), have argued that the U.S. does not need to pursue arms reduction treaties with Russia. Their arsenal can decay while we can keep a larger arsenal. Here again, this would be a mistake. Rather than force Russia to do whatever it can to maintain unsafe and unreliable warheads subject to accidental firing, the U.S. should pursue verifiable, guaranteed reductions.</span></p> <p><span>Helms opposes any administration attempt to seek ABM Treaty modifications that could limit NMD and be coupled with further arms reductions. Texas Gov. George W. Bush has also stated that he would abrogate the treaty if Russia would not allow a missile defense of his choosing.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike Russia, China realizes that NMD would directly threaten the viability of its nuclear deterrent, which includes only about 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles. Aside from taking the obvious step of potentially building up its nuclear arsenal in response to NMD, China has already taken diplomatic steps and could take other military steps in opposition. In October 1999, China joined forces with Russia in cosponsoring a United Nations resolution calling for adherence to the ABM Treaty. In February, China spoke out in the Conference on Disarmament about preventing an arms race in outer space. A Chinese missile buildup could fuel the arms race between India and Pakistan.</span></p> <p><span>More than ten years after the Cold War, the U.S. needs to reevaluate what it has accomplished with the \"gift of time\" that nuclear activist Jonathan Schell '65 eloquently wrote about in 1998. Writing soon after news of the Clinton administration's nuclear war fighting plans trickled to the press, Schell noted the irony of the U.S., the strongest conventional military power, clinging to nuclear weapons for its security when the demise of the Soviet Union presented an opportunity for moving resolutely toward nuclear abolition.</span></p> <p><span>President Clinton should delay a decision to deploy missile defense and seize the opportunity to achieve deeper arms reductions with Russia.</span></p> <p><span><i>Charles D.

Joy silenced the audience with graphic accounts of historic plagues and offered controversial ideas about the need to regulate technology.</span></p> <p><span>Much of Joy's argument was based on Moore's Law, which holds that technological capabilities double every 18 months.</span></p> <p><span>He said that although processing speed in solid state computers has been predicted to hit a ceiling soon, recent developments suggest the curve will continue until at least 2030. By then, he claimed, computers will be a million times as fast as they are now.</span></p> <p><span>\"We really can't imagine the effects of being able to do things a million times as fast,\" Joy said.</span></p> <p><span>Joy stopped short of proposing a governing body overseeing technology and the propagation of ideas, but he urged greater discussion of scientific advancement's ethical and social ramifications. In the future, he said, clearer laws on the subject may be needed.</span></p> <p><span>\"When computer code becomes a weapon, when everything becomes immaterial, we will have to make a distinction more precisely between speech, for example, and a weapon,\" he said. \"We may have to amend the Constitution.\"</span></p> <p><span>Joy said that the most immediate threat produced by scientific advancement would be genetically engineered pathogens.</span></p> <p><span>\"It could be possible to scan through the human immune system looking for holes and make the perfect pathogen,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>He also identified organic pathogens enhanced by nanotechology and intelligent robots as potential threats.</span></p> <p><span>Joy also claimed that knowledge itself might eventually be used as a destructive weapon, though he gave no specific description of how such a weapon would work.</span></p> <p><span>Now that technological advancement is driven primarily by private industry rather than government, and information is more widely accessible than ever before through the Internet, improving technology may make weapons of mass destruction available to more than just powerful nations, Joy said.</span></p> <p><span>\"Soon, someone may be able to distribute a self-propagating bomb as easily as someone distributed the 'I Love You' virus yesterday,\" Joy said, referring to the destructive virus that affected computers worldwide.</span></p> <p><span>Joy's controversial theories have made waves throughout the technology world, especially since his article on the topic in the current issue of Wired magazine.</span></p> <p><span>Some members of the audience praised Joy for questioning the assumptions upon which businesses operate.</span></p> <p><span>\"Unrestrained, unplanned growth is the core religious belief of capitalism,\" said Zack Exley, creator of the political satire website GWBush.com. \"Bill Joy is a heretic for speaking out against that, and that is very courageous.\"</span></p>"}

From a 57 Chevy to her own jet, and from a mansion to her own horse stable, she's got it made. She's a fairy princess, a S.C.U.B.A. diver, a Hollywood actress, an Olympic athlete, a pilot and a ballerina. She even rides a Harley Davidson motorcycle. And now,  Barbie is running for president.</span></p> <p><span>Mattel Corporation, the maker of Barbie, has recently released \"Presidential Candidate Barbie.\" Dressed in pearls and a blue suit, Barbie has her hair styled in a sophisticated blonde bob, a la Tipper Gore, and comes with a campaign pin and her own podium.</span></p> <p><span>But, like so many times in the past, Barbie again finds herself in the midst of controversy. Feminists have recently criticized Mattel for yet again sending the wrong message to young American girls--that a woman must look like Barbie before she will be elected president. They have protested that President Barbie is another example of our society's double-standard: That a man is rewarded for intelligence and hard work, while a women is only allowed to achieve success if she fits our culture's standards of beauty. God forbid we have a frumpy woman president!</span></p> <p><span>But the fact is that the presidential candidate is one small step for Barbie, one giant leap for womankind. Never before has there been a female President doll, regardless of her physical figure or her dress. President Barbie is the same \"woman\" who can be anything she wants to be--including a wonderful example for young girls. She has certainly come a long way from where she started, as a 1960s fashion model.</span></p> <p><span>Besides, what's wrong with having a good-looking president? Barbie's critics say that she sets an unreasonable physical standard for young women and girls. While  most women do not have Barbie's perfect figure, attractive and intelligent women should not be discounted as bimbos simply because they are beautiful. A woman's worth cannot be judged by her looks, good or bad.</span></p> <p><span>Barbie does not set any worse of an example through the way she looks than our real life president does in disgracing his own family and the entire nation through his perpetual distortions of the truth. A man who lies under oath and cheats on his wife with a woman half his age is a far worse role model for American youth, male and female, than a well-proportioned doll. Mattel's efforts to foster a sense of achievement and self-worth among young girls should be applauded.</span></p> <p><span>The development of President Barbie demonstrates that they are thinking far beyond the majority of the American population in realizing that a female president will be a reality in the not-so-distant future. They have even set up a Campaign 2000 website for Barbie, which outlines her campaign platform. Not surprisingly, Barbie is a liberal whose primary concerns are equality, world peace, animal kindness, education and the environment. The site, which is geared toward girls ages 5 to 14, encourages them to think about issues which are important to them. It also features a section devoted to real-life women in government and a daily updated local and national survey.</span></p> <p><span>Mattel could even expand Campaign 2000 in the future by giving Barbie an opponent who supports a different political agenda. Skipper could be her running mate. And once Barbie is elected in November--she'll obviously win--Mattel could manufacture her own presidential accessories. Instead of a \"Dream House\" she could have her own White House, complete with Rose Garden and Oval Office. Instead of a pink corvette, she could have an Air Force One Jet.</span></p> <p><span>And best of all, Ken would be the First Man.</span></p> <p><span><i>Allison A.

Perl-Matanzo '01, who is the founder and director of Harvard Students for Peace in Vieques, Now!, helped lead the crowd with a megaphone, shouting out slogans in both English and Spanish.</span></p> <p><span>\"This is an act of civil disobedience,\" said Latinos for Social Change member Hector G. Arce, who is also a Harvard graduate student. \"We did not ask for permission to stay here.\"</span></p> <p><span>The U.S. Navy has occupied Vieques since 1941, using the island as a training ground for air, land and sea forces, including weapons and bomb testing. Protesters say the testing has hurt the island's environment and the health its 9,300 residents, and argue the U.S. Navy should leave the island immediately.</span></p> <p><span>On Thursday, U.S. marshals and FBI agents peacefully removed 216 protesters who had been camped at the military training range since April 1999.  The group began its protests after civilian guard David Sanes was accidentally killed by an errant bomb drop last year.</span></p> <p><span>Perl-Matanzo said he believes the removal of the protesters from the Vieques military range will only strengthen the growing outcry against the navy presence.</span></p> <p><span>\"The removal made the struggle shift from speculation to a show of force where the U.S. made it clear it is more important to continue its colonial legacy than change its policy,\" Perl-Matanzo said.</span></p> <p><span>The protesters removal has brought international attention to the situation in Vieques, helping spur the actions of those supporting U.S. withdrawal.</span></p> <p><span>On Friday, several protests took place across the country. Fifteen protesters were arrested in front of an U.S. Navy recruiting office in Philadelphia. Also, eight students rushed the field during a Yankees game in New York carrying Puerto Rican flags. Perl-Matanzo said the students were from Dartmouth.</span></p> <p><span>Five uniformed police officers were present throughout the demonstration, but did not interfere with the protest. The group did not obtain any permits to camp in front of the building, but said they plan to stay until the bombing stops or they are removed.</span></p> <p><span>The group has not been contacted by any police officials, and is currently unsure of whether they will be allowed to stay. Most of the group said they believe that if any action is taken, it will occur this morning, when thousands of commuters arrive to work in the heavily trafficked area.</span></p> <p><span>\"We are in a very ambiguous position,\" said Jim Seale-Collazo, a first-year student at the Graduate School of Education. \"I don't think we have forced them into any situation where they will have to respond to us, but we really don't know.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kimberly M. Sanchez '03 said she believes continued protests are the best way to keep the Vieques issue in the public spotlight.</span></p> <p><span>\"Now that the civil disobedience camps on the island have been dismantled, this is the only avenue left open for supporters to voice their condemnation of the human rights violations that have and will take place on Vieques if the U.S. Navy is allowed to continue its occupation of the island,\" Sanchez wrote in an e-mail message.</span></p> <p><span>Sanchez, who is a Puerto Rican native, visited Vieques during winter break, and has been actively involved with Perl-Matanzo in the campaign to end U.S. testing there. She attended the protest on Friday and said she plans to camp out at the JFK building this Wednesday night.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is absolutely no reason why the Navy should have to conduct live bombing practices on a small, inhabited island,\" she said. \"Viequenses are being taken advantage of and put at risk. Their rights are not being respected.\"</span></p> <p><span>Several Latino community leaders, as well as Boston City Councillors Charles H. Turner and Charles C. Yancey, spoke at Friday's demonstration, expressing support for the right of the people of Vieques to decide whether the U.S. Navy can continue testing.</span></p> <p><span>In January, President Clinton agreed to allow Puerto Ricans to have a referendum on the issue. The U.S. has agreed to leave by May 1, 2003 if voters reject the U.S. Navy's presence. No date for the referendum has been set.</span></p> <p><span>Protesters said the referendum is not enough, saying they want the navy to leave immediately.</span></p> <p><span>The protesters said they also hope that the continued protests will become an election issue during the 2000 presidential campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\"Protests like these send politicians such as Clinton and Gore the message that there are many who care about this issue and are even willing to be arrested in support of their convictions,\" Sanchez said.</span></p> <p><span>\"With election time just around the corner, politicians must pay attention to our demands in order to secure the valuable Latino vote,\" she added.</span></p> <p><span>Perl-Matanzo and his group have been working all year to gather support for the movement to reclaim the island.</span></p> <p><span>In November, the group circulated a petition calling for the removal of U.S. forces from Vieques, which was signed by over 300 students as well as 65 professors, including Frankfurter Professor of Law Alan M. Dershowitz, Warburg Professor of Economics <i>emeritus</i> John Kenneth Galbraith and Fletcher University Professor Cornel R. West '74.</span></p> <p><span>In February, the group persuaded the Cambridge City Council to pass a resolution urging the U.S. Navy to leave Vieques.

{"title": "Starr Rebuffs Critics at Forum | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>A defiant Kenneth W. Starr last night defended his five-year tenure as independent counsel, sharply and sometimes sarcastically reproving student questioners who criticized his investigation.</span></p> <p><span>And Starr sharply accused the Clinton Justice Department of hindering his own attempt to probe whether his prosecutors leaked information to the media.</span></p> <p><span>Starr's appearance at the ARCO Forum was billed as a public address, and for 20 minutes, he delivered a prepared speech on the constitution and the independent counsel statute.</span></p> <p><span>But his strongest and most passionate words came during the 45 minutes of questioning.</span></p> <p><span>E. Clarke Tucker '01, a native of Little Rock, Arkansas, was the first to question Starr.</span></p> <p><span>Tucker said the intrusiveness of Starr's extensive corruption probe in his home state, which often dipped into the personal lives of the accused, \"was the worst thing to happen in the history of our state.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"You were wrong. Will you admit to it?\" Tucker asked.</span></p> <p><span>Starr put his hands on the podium. \"This has been very unhappy for Arkansas. But, Clarke, unfortunately for the state of Arkansas, it deserved better government than it had,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Starr said he wouldn't apologize for his investigation or its methods, calling it his \"duty\" to root out corruption.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout his speech and the questioning period, Starr defended the scope of his work, repeating that he had a \"mandate\" to look into \"perjury, intimidation of witnesses, subornation of perjury or obstruction of justice.\"</span></p> <p><span>To a French journalist, Starr said, \"If you read my mandate--and I'm sure you report this to your readers in France--Ken's mandate does not use the 's' word. It did use the 'p' word, and the 'o' word and the 'I' word, because those are federal crimes in the United States,\" said Starr as some members of the crowd began to hiss.</span></p> <p><span>Starr used the twenty minutes allotted for the speech to sketch the reasons he thought the Senate had not sustained President Clinton's impeachment.</span></p> <p><span>Starr, the solicitor general in the Bush administration, said the \"structure\" of American government made impeachment an untenable alternative.</span></p> <p><span>He said all branches of government are biased toward stability.</span></p> <p><span>\"The American people decided that they wouldn't support the removal from office of a duly elected president,\" he said. \"Censure was a more narrowly tailored and appropriate remedy to the President's misconduct.\"</span></p> <p><span>Starr said the independent counsel statute, which Congress enacted in 1978 following the turmoil of Watergate, was bad government.</span></p> <p><span>\"It was a well-intention but illusory effort to eradicate politics or the appearance of politics from the administration of Justice,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Starr avoided direct criticism of Janet Reno's Justice Department, with the exception of one story during the question-and-answer period.</span></p> <p><span>On Feb. 9, 1998, Starr's office was accused by Clinton lawyer David Kendall of leaking grand jury testimony to the media.</span></p> <p><span>Starr said that as soon as he was made aware of the allegations, he called the FBI and spoke with assistant director Neil Gallagher.</span></p> <p><span>Starr said he asked that FBI agents investigate his own office.</span></p> <p><span>But, he said, \"the Justice Department forbade the FBI from providing that assistance.\"</span></p> <p><span>Starr denied that he or his prosecutors leaked grand jury testimony, which would have been illegal under federal law. He said that Clinton's lawyers had shared that information with the media.</span></p> <p><span>\"I believe that we conducted ourselves honorably,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Starr's odyssey from a federal appellate judge known mainly to Washington insiders to a symbol of the Clinton's impeachment crisis began in 1994, when a three-judge panel asked him to become the independent counsel charged with investigating the Whitewater land deals and other matters.</span></p> <p><span>In late 1997 and early 1998, Starr began to investigate whether Clinton had pressured a White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky, to lie in her deposition to the Paula Jones lawsuit.</span></p> <p><span>When cyber-gossip Matt Drudge made public the new tack of Starr's probe, the White House fought back.</span></p> <p><span>Starr was pigeonholed as prurient and incompetent.</span></p> <p><span>\"It got very nasty,\" said Newsweek's Michael Isikoff, the reporter who broke the Lewinsky case. \"You [had] so many people who [were] portrayed as enemies of the Clintons and as driven by hatred and deep seated animus,\" he said. \"The White House people were very successful in portraying Starr as the right-wing zealot when the truth is, he was not that at all.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Gene Lyons, the former editor of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, said that the criticism of Starr is deserved.</span></p> <p><span>The prosecutor's team in Arkansas \"turned the whole state upside down,\" Lyons said. And as to whether the president perjured himself or suborned Lewinsky's perjury, \"they assumed Clinton's guilt, and they set out to prove it, no matter how they were going to get there,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>Both Isikoff and Lyons have authored or co-authored books about the scandals.</span></p> <p><span>Starr's investigation, which resulted in the trial and conviction of 14 former Clinton associates on charges ranging from bribery to perjury, cost taxpayers more than $50 million dollars, according to a just-released General Accounting Office report.</span></p> <p><span>Since he stepped down from the post in February, Starr has lectured around the country. He is currently an adjunct professor of law at New York University.</span></p> <p><span>The Forum event was Alan Simpson's last.

Not Politics Tops Students' Agendas | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Harvard students want to change the world and see community service--not politics--as the most effective way to do so, according to a survey by the Institute of Politics (IOP).</span></p> <p><span>78 percent of the 300 students polled said they performed community service within the last year while only 38.7 percent had joined a political organization. Less than one-fourth have volunteered or plan to volunteer for a political campaign this year.</span></p> <p><span>\"[Students] aren't against politics in the abstract--they just think it is more difficult to get involved in politics,\" said Trevor D. Dryer '00-'02, who co-chaired the committee that developed the survey. \"Community service is easier and you see more tangible results.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Dryer said the survey showed that a majority of students still think that politics are relevant.</span></p> <p><span>\"The lack of involvement is more of a disconnection with the system,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>The survey also showed that around 76 percent of students plan to vote for Al Gore '69 in the next presidential election, compared to 17.3 percent who intend to vote for George W. Bush Fifty-eight percent of students surveyed identified themselves as Democrats, 10.8 said they were Republicans and 23.8 percent said they were independent.</span></p> <p><span>Dryer and Erin B. Ashwell '02, co-chair of the IOP working  group that developed the survey, said they came up with the idea for the survey last fall when they noticed that many of their friends were involved in community service but not politically active.</span></p> <p><span>\"We wanted to do the survey because people are interested in community and social change but my fear is that they don't see politics as part of that process,\" Ashwell said. \"It just worries me that people don't see politics as an avenue through which to change their communities.\"</span></p> <p><span>Ashwell and Dryer took their idea to IOP leaders to obtain funding for the survey, and hired an opinion researcher to serve as an adviser.</span></p> <p><span>Each week, Ashwell, Dryer, the advisor and a committee of students met to design the survey.</span></p> <p><span>\"I see government as a vehicle for changing the world around me, but many young people don't see national or even state politics as a way of changing things,\" said committee member Kara A. Shamy '03. \"I wanted to see why that was.\"</span></p> <p><span>Before administering the survey, the committee also convened two focus groups of students from Harvard and other area colleges to determine ways that students can become more involved in politics on campus.</span></p> <p><span>\"Access to political information and resources is a big issue,\" wrote Anne Aaron, IOP director of outreach and communications in an e-mail message. \"Students say they would prefer that political information be better, that political involvement be made easier.  They also want better and easier access to direct democracy; they expressed strong support for measures that would simplify the process of registering and voting.\"</span></p> <p><span>While 68.6 percent of students polled said they would vote in the next election, 82.6 percent said they would definitely vote if they had the option to vote over the Internet.</span></p> <p><span>IOP Director Alan K. Simpson said the fact that only around 70 percent of respondents said they were currently registered to vote indicates that a considerable amount more needs to be done to get students registered.\t\"The very core of any political activity is voting,\" Simpson said.\tSimpson, a former senator from Wyoming, said the future of Medicare and social security should be particularly important to students.</span></p> <p><span>\"Young people can bitch and moan and complain about politics,\" he said. \"But if you don't get involved, the senior citizen lobby will overwhelm your generation.\"</span></p> <p><span>Dryer said the survey's results showed there was strong support for the creation of a student-oriented political action committee that would train students and help get them elected to local, state and federal offices.</span></p> <p><span>He also said that the survey's results should be useful to student political groups on campus.</span></p> <p><span>\"The survey gives different extracurricular organizations a roadmap of how to get students involved,\" Dryer said.</span></p> <p><span>Aaron said the IOP plans to review the results and develop a plan of action in the coming year.</span></p> <p><span>\"We will look at these ideas through the prism of the IOP's mission, and perhaps try some new things,\" Aaron wrote. \"Most importantly, we will continue to support the great contribution Harvard students make to their communities and to the world.

{"title": "Earning McCain's Endorsement | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>When Arizona Sen. John S. McCain endorsed Texas Gov. George W. Bush last week, the tension and distaste between the two former rivals was palpable. Through bitter, back-and-forth rounds of primaries and personal attacks, Bush and McCain developed a great deal of animosity towards each other. At this point, both politicians feel that burying the hatchet would be in their best interests. McCain hopes to repair his tattered reputation inside the Republican Party, and Bush knows that he needs moderate McCain supporters to win the general election.</span></p> <p><span>However, McCain's supporters should not flock to the governor unless he adopts the pieces of McCain's platform that were so attractive to the electorate. McCain's campaign finance reform package was perhaps his most appealing attribute. He promised to clean up the corrupt election system and root out the special interests. Bush depends on wealthy, well-connected supporters to a huge extent, clearly shown by his immense early fundraising advantage. In order to attract McCain's supporters, he should show some of McCain's courage and propose a strong and comprehensive plan of campaign finance reform that may not endear him to his wealthy donors.</span></p> <p><span>By the same token, people who were impressed that McCain considered shoring up Social Security and Medicare to be an important conservative priority will find little to love in Bush's domestic agenda. Instead of protecting these essential obligations, Bush threatens to use a huge chunk of the projected surplus on a tax cut.</span></p> <p><span>It was clearly not easy for McCain to endorse Bush; the senator did not use that word until prompted by a reporter after his speech. He openly compared the experience to taking a dose of medicine, and asked that he not be considered for the vice-presidential nomination. While McCain stated that he agrees with Bush on many issues, including education, health care and the military, it was painfully obvious that they still differ substantially on the issues about which McCain is most passionate.</span></p> <p><span>The theme that resonated with voters was McCain's promise of government reform. McCain sensed a disillusionment of the American people with the political process. He tapped that current by offering an alternative to the elite's picked candidates. Unless Bush makes a credible commitment to campaign finance reform and the other reform causes that McCain championed, his \"reformer with results\" label will ring hollow. Even though Bush has gained McCain's endorsement, he will have to work harder to earn the endorsement of McCain's supporters.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Campaign 2004: A Preview | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Voting in a presidential election can be like trying to predict the future. One must choose one of two candidates, in hopes that his decisions and policies over the next four years will be wise, or at least relatively sane. In order to assist your decision-making process, the following are two scenarios about what might happen under either a Gore, or a Bush, administration. The New York Times, May 24, 2004:</span></p> <p><span>Gore Poised to Defeat Challenger in November: WASHINGTON: In a ceremony on the White House lawn today, President Al Gore announced the invention of the newest generation of the Internet, Internet-IV. On the heels of a poll showing Gore leading his Republican challenger by 10 points in November's re-election contest, Gore showed no signs of slowing down his administration's agenda and used his speech to review some of its major accomplishments to date.</span></p> <p><span>\"As a result of this administration's reinventing government efforts, the Code of Federal Regulations has been pared down to an eight-page pamphlet,\" Gore said. The pamphlet, claimed by many as emblematic of Gore's successes at streamlining the federal government, is available via the Internet at http://www.whitehouse.gov.</span></p> <p><span>Gore also emphasized the major accomplishments his administration has encouraged in the area of science and technology. In 2002, Gore implemented his plan to broadcast a continuous satellite image of the Earth, and mandate that all cable television providers carry the new Earth Channel. Gore also claimed credit for recent advances in mobile phone technology and computer processing speed.</span></p> <p><span>President Gore again claimed that this administration is the most accessible in recent memory, citing his weekly \"e-mail town hall\" forums as evidence. Vice President John Kerry's numerous television appearances have contributed to the high profile of the administration, and late-night talk show hosts have taken to calling Vice President Kerry by a nickname he earned while he was a Senator from Massachusetts, \"Live Shot.\"</span></p> <p><span>All analysts are pointing to an easy re-election for Gore-Kerry this November, propelled in large part by the support of the influential Buddhist community, which rose to political prominence after Gore's election in 2000. As well, Gore's approval ratings remain high after his high-profile role in putting down a possible rebellion in the state of Texas, led by its rogue governor, defeated 2000 Presidential candidate George W. Bush. Gore's use of the newly-created National Park Service \"Controlled Burn\" Strike Force was lauded by military analysts and the public as a unique solution to an intractable problem.</span></p> <p><span>Bush in Line for Re-Election Victory: KENNEBUNKPORT, MAINE: From the summer White House in Kennebunkport, President George W. Bush today expressed confidence that his re-election bid would be successful, after the release of polls showing him 10 points ahead of his Democratic challenger, and touted the accomplishments of his first three and a half years in office.</span></p> <p><span>The economy, he said, should keep growing at its rapid pace. The stock market was up 1000 points yesterday on the news of the release of Microsoft's Windows 2005, which will be available for all computers, televisions, radios, and household appliances on June 30.</span></p> <p><span>Said Secretary of Commerce Bill Gates, \"Under this Republican administration, the free market has flourished; we've come a long way since the days of Democratic antitrust witch hunts.\" The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to hit a record high of 30,000 within the next month. Investors were particularly exuberant this week after the announcement that the bug in Windows 2004, in which the newly-functional Internet refrigerator plug-in caused widespread failures during Fourth of July weekend last year, will be fixed in the new version.</span></p> <p><span>In the area of crime prevention, Bush emphasized two major successes of his administration: The passage of the National Concealed Weapons Authorization Act of 2001, and the successful implementation of its pledge to conduct 1,000 federal executions in its first 1,000 days. \"The right to carry concealed handguns is now ensured for all Americans, thanks to the efforts of this administration,\" said Attorney General Charlton Heston.</span></p> <p><span>Bush did not mention what many consider the most high-profile failure of his administration, in the area of foreign policy. At the administration's first state dinner, the President mistakenly referred to the President of Turkey as the \"Shah of Turkmenistan,\" and the people of the country as \"Turkeys.\" The resultant diplomatic repercussions resulted in the State Dinner Conflict of 2002, which ended with an official apology and the resignation of the Secretary of State.</span></p> <p><span>Bush will return to the White House next Monday, after a week spent recreating with \"First Dad\" George Bush Sr. On Tuesday, he plans to inaugurate the newly-completed White House shooting range, on the site of the former jogging track.</span></p> <p><span><i>Noelle Eckley '00 is an environmental sciences and public policy concentrator in Dunster House.

{"title": "Behind the Macabre | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Once asked what frightened him most, Edward St. John Gorey '50 replied, \"Life. Everything about life.\"</span></p> <p><span>Artist, writer and stage designer who gained infamy through crosshatched macabre-style artwork, Gorey died from a heart attack this April 15.  He was 75.</span></p> <p><span>Edward Gorey seemed to live in a world of his own.  Not only because he was reclusive and remained a bachelor for life, but because he isolated himself from conventional art trends.  His drawings were fanciful and ambiguous, and he refused to explain them.  He shunned publicity and Hollywood fame.  He expressed strong convictions and behaved in ways that did not necessarily jibe with conventional belief.</span></p> <p><span>But a look at the artist's life and artwork may reveal a greater worldview than mere macabre. And Gorey's artwork is now the only true remaining source for the many questions Gorey left unanswered.</span></p> <p><span>Alison Lurie '47, a close friend of Gorey's for many years, sums up in a memoriam published in the New York Review of Books, her tribute to Gorey's lifetime accomplishments:  \"Often, characters in Gorey's books who die or disappear leave only a void behind:  empty cross-hatched streets and withered formal gardens and rooms with strange wallpaper. We are luckier.\"</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>The Gorey Files </b><p> </p></font>Gorey wrote over 90 books and illustrated more than 60 others. His black-and-white illustrations, crosshatched and intricate, were beautifully precise and distinct.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>His style soon became associated with the macabre themes of his drawings. He was asked to illustrate the opening credits of the PBS television series \"Mystery\" as well as many other book covers. Gorey also  designed the set and costumes for the Broadway show <i>Dracula</i>, for which he received a Tony Award in 1978.</span></p> <p><span>Gorey's literature was also a bit Surrealist.  The text of his short books was often as ambiguous as his illustrations.  The short verses often did not follow each other smoothly. But most characteristic of Gorey's literature was his unique ability to describe tragic events with bizarre humor.</span></p> <p><span>Gorey liked to write about death and random disappearances and other ghastly happenings. He often made children the subject of these occurrences. He illustrated the English alphabet in several variations, depicting an unusual, grim or humorous way that children may die for each letter.</span></p> <p><span><i>The Gashlycrumb Tinies</i>, one of Gorey's most famous books, is one such illustrated alphabet. It begins: \"A is for Amy who fell down the stairs, B is for Basil assaulted by bears.\"</span></p> <p><span>Karen Wilkin, who co-authored the book <i>The World of Edward Gorey</i> with Clifford Ross, suggests Gorey's drawings were superficially grim, but their bizarre aspects added a humorous tone.</span></p> <p><span>She recalls an Oscar Wilde witticism: \"One must have a heart of stone to read the death of Little Nell without laughing.\"</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Frankenstein in Chicago </b><p> </p></font>Edward Gorey was born in Chicago in 1925, to a Roman Catholic newspaper report and Episcopalian mother.  He began to read and draw at a very early age; he first picked up a pencil at only 18 months, drawing passing trains. But he told the Christian Science Monitor that he was not quite impressed by those drawings.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>\"I hasten to add they showed no talent whatsoever,\" he said.  \"They looked like irregular sausages.\"</span></p> <p><span>He taught himself to read by age three, and by five he had read Shelley's Frankenstein.  By eight he had read all of Victor Hugo's works.</span></p> <p><span>Gorey's only formal art training came during the single year that he attended the Art Institute of Chicago, after graduating high school.  But he was drafted into the army in 1944, serving as a clerk for two years at a chemical weapons testing site. When released, Gorey, then 21 years old, came to Harvard in the fall of 1946.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Odd Man in Eliot House </b><p> </p></font>Gorey's life at Harvard revolved around the arts; he concentrated in French literature and was involved in several drama productions as an undergraduate. He roomed, for several years, with future poet Frank O'Hara '50 in Eliot House.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>Brad Gooch writes of the duo's college days in <i>City Poet</i>, his 1995 biography of O'Hara. Gooch quotes photographer George Marshall '51-53 who classified Gorey, known to wear capes and numerous rings, as the \"oddest person I've ever seen. He was very tall, with his hair plastered down across the front like bangs, like a Roman emperor.\"</span></p> <p><span>Gooch reports Gorey and O'Hara established for themselves distinct reputations on campus. Gorey romped around in long fur coats and basketball sneakers; when he wore sandals, his toenails were sometimes painted green.</span></p> <p><span>He and O'Hara adorned their Eliot House suite with white modern garden furniture, including a chaise lounge.  They used as a coffee table a tombstone taken from Mt. Auburn Cemetery.  Gorey often sat atop this table while designing his illustrations.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Poet's Theatre </b><p> </p></font>Undecided in what career to pursue, Gorey remained in Cambridge for a few years after graduation. Both he and O'Hara became active in the Harvard Poet's Theatre, a group of Harvard and Radcliffe students who performed low-budget, self-written plays to small audiences.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>They often found space to perform at the Fogg Art Museum, as well as a little house located on Palmer Street.  The Palmer Street Theater, which could only house 47 guests, was, in time, taken over by the Coop.</span></p> <p><span>Alison Lurie remembers fondly one of the plays that Gorey wrote and directed through the Poet's Theater.  It was called <i>Amabel</i>, and \"was very amusing.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"It was very much like the work he became famous for; kind of Victorian, kind of Edwardian,\" she recalls. \"It had the kind of way-out characters and costumes that he had fun creating.\"</span></p> <p><span>The friends who formed the Harvard Poets Theatre included O'Hara, Kenneth Koch '48 and John Ashbery '49, in addition to Gorey and Lurie. They formed a tight group, according to Lurie.</span></p> <p><span>\"The people most involved in the theater saw each other all the time,\" she remembers.  \"And we all had a wonderful time.\"</span></p> <p><span>And they fooled around like typical Harvard students.</span></p> <p><span>\"We did odd things,\" says Lurie.  \"We would go to the Morgan Memorial, which was a big old second-hand place where we could get costumes; or we would go out to the cemetery and make rubbings with crayons and ink,\" she continued.</span></p> <p><span>\"We had no idea that some of the people involved were going to grow up to be famous poets, so we didn't take ourselves that seriously.  The people that took themselves seriously, not all that much became of them.\"</span></p> <p><span>Gorey was involved with several other plays with the Poet's Theater, but he eventually decided it was time to move on.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Fantod Press </b><p> </p></font>Gorey left Cambridge for New York City. He juggled several jobs, but did not find any that suited him.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>\"I wanted to have my own bookstore until I worked in one,\" he told The Boston Globe in 1998. \"Then I thought I'd be a librarian until I met some crazy ones. I hoped to get into publishing, but at 28, my parents were still helping me out. Which wasn't good at all.\"</span></p> <p><span>Gorey eventually settled down to write and draw. Unsuccessful attempts to find a publisher led the artist to print under his own name: Fantod Press. (The Random House Dictionary defines a fantod as a state of extreme nervous or restlessness. In several of Gorey's works, fantods appear as small, winged creatures stuffed in bell jars.)</span></p> <p><span>Throughout his career, Gorey has also published under several different names: D. Awdrey-Gore, E.G. Deadworry, Ogdred Weary--all anagrams of his own original name.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Count Dracula </b><p> </p></font>Once in New York, Gorey adopted a new lifestyle, one of aesthetic pleasure.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>He attended opera performances and symphony concerts, visited museums, and most persistently, became an avid ballet fanatic. Gorey later recalls choreographer George Balanchine as one of the most important influences in his life. At one point, Gorey attended not only each of Balanchine's ballets, but every performance of every show.</span></p> <p><span>After Balanchine's death in 1983, Gorey would withdraw from the city to a provincial house on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span>Gorey continued to draw and write throughout his years in New York.  In 1977, he designed the set and costumes for the Broadway musical <i>Dracula</i>; in 1978, he won the Tony award for Costume design, but declined to accept the award. Gorey refused to go to Hollywood, and did not even attend the opening night.</span></p> <p><span>But Michael Romanos, an admirer of Gorey's work, recalls the mastery of Gorey's scenery.</span></p> <p><span>\"When the curtain opened, before any people had come on stage, the set got a standing ovation,\" Romanos recounts.</span></p> <p><span>And Romanos, who was living in Boston at the time, knew of Gorey's move to Cape Cod.  He attempted to search out the artist; he began with the telephone book.</span></p> <p><span>\"I knew where he lived, and I was prepared to search for him under all his different [anagramed] names,\" says Romanos.  \"But I opened the phonebook, and there he was under his real name.\"</span></p> <p><span>Despite Romanos' unexpected calling, Gorey was very receptive to his fan's aspiration to meet in person. The two talked about art, about photography versus drawing--Romanos even took a few photographs of his adored artist (<i>pictured above</i>).</span></p> <p><span>In the following years, Romanos visited Gorey twice more.</span></p> <p><span>\"My overwhelming impression of him was that he was a very gracious and pleasant person,\" recalls Romanos.  \"He was a little put off by all the attention that he received, but he was very open to me, a young artist just starting out.\"</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>To the Great Beyond </b><p> </p></font>For the last 20 years of his life, Gorey remained in his cottage in Yarmouth Port. He originally shared the house with some of his aunts, but later lived alone, except for the company of his cats and other furry friends.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>Gorey never married, and had told some interviewers that he had never even been emotionally involved.</span></p> <p><span>In 1994, when Gorey conducted an interview with The New York Times shortly after being diagnosed with prostate cancer, he talked about the approaching last years of his life.</span></p> <p><span>\"I thought, 'Oh gee, why haven't I burst into total screaming hysterics?'\"</span></p> <p><span>His answer: \"I'm the opposite of hypochondriacal. I'm not entirely enamored of the idea of living forever.\"</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Animal House </b><p> </p></font>When Gorey died, he left his entire estate to a charitable trust fund for animal shelters.  Once legal proceedings are complete, profits from Gorey's estate and virtually all of his possessions will be distributed to shelters across the nation.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>The executors of the trust fund include lawyer Andrew Boose, and two of Gorey's close friends: Andreas L. Brown, owner of Gotham Book Mart, the New York City bookstore and art gallery that currently houses all of Gorey's archives, and friend Clifford Ross.</span></p> <p><span>Ross became familiar with Gorey's work through a critical analysis; he completed his senior thesis at Yale on Edward Gorey.  Though he met Gorey for the first time when he was 18 years old, it was only later in life that he established the close friendship that would last until Gorey's death.</span></p> <p><span>Ross, together with Karen Wilkin, published <i>The World of Edward Gorey</i> in 1996 to honor the work of the \"sophisticated, fine artist.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Ross' attraction to Gorey, as a personality aside from his work, was his interesting perspective on culture and life.</span></p> <p><span>\"I so thoroughly enjoyed talking to him about any facet of culture,\" says Ross.</span></p> <p><span>\"We would talk about things that either one or us loved or hated.\"</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Behind the Drawing </b><p> </p></font>But not about Gorey's artwork. If Gorey's artwork seemed ambiguous, it was ambiguous for a reason; he refused to explain it.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>So if a reporter were to ask Gorey why he illustrated stories of children dying, as one reporter once did, he would retort with a ridiculously absurd explanation.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's obviously much more poignant to do things to children,\" Gorey told that one reporter who inquired.</span></p> <p><span>\"The meaning of the work had to become evident through the work itself,\" Ross says. \"[Gorey] was simply uninterested in explaining his work to anyone, especially himself, or perhaps, most importantly himself.\"</span></p> <p><span>Take for example a bizarre drawing with a candle that seems to exist in thin air, Ross elaborates.</span></p> <p><span>\"The floating candle would stand for itself. And you would have to react to the floating candle yourself,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>And for Ross, his admiration of Gorey was based on the purity of his work.</span></p> <p><span>\"[Gorey] didn't court the favor of the art world or the world of culture,\" Ross conjures.  \"He just went on doing his work.  Of all the things that drew me to him, the most impressive was the honesty of the endeavor. He just did his work and the world be damned.\"</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>More Than a Fisherman </b><p> </p></font>Gorey first established a relationship with Brown and Gotham Book Mart in 1968; he came by the bookstore, as a customer, and attempted to sell some of his books printed under Fantod Press.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>Gotham began displaying and selling his works, and has, since the first year, held an exhibit of Gorey's art at least once a year.</span></p> <p><span>When Gorey moved from New York City, and did not care for the burden of relocating all of his work, he left it in the hands of Gotham Book Mart.</span></p> <p><span>Brown admits he had gotten pretty close to Gorey over the past few decades.</span></p> <p><span>\"When you work with a man and display his work for over 30 years, you get to know him and his artwork pretty well,\" says Brown.</span></p> <p><span>And Brown finds Gorey's work profound.</span></p> <p><span>\"I'm of the theory that [Gorey] was up to much more that he would admit to,\" Brown says.  \"He would say that his work was just what you saw, and nothing more, but I think it's similar to Hemingway's claim that <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> was just about an old fisherman and nothing else.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"Gorey, as scholarly as he was, had a lot of hidden implications in his work.</span></p> <p><span>He was addressing basic philosophic issues about life and living, and was making strong convictions with his art,\" he continues. \"His art is not just frivolous, light-hearted humor, but serious statements. There's more than meets the eye.\"</span></p> <p><span>After a pause, Brown adds, \"Scholars in the coming years will keep digging and keep discovering.\"</span></p>"}

Bush and lending his weight to a proposal to cut nuclear reserves.</span></p> <p><span>Last year, Kissinger published the third volume of his well-received series of memoirs and has maintained a heavy schedule of international speaking engagements.</span></p> <p><span>But the one-time Harvard professor has not officially ventured back to his alma mater for more than 20 years.</span></p> <p><span>\"To the best of my knowledge, [Kissinger] has not attended any University function in Cambridge since the end of the Vietnam War,\" says University Marshal Richard M. Hunt. And Kissinger has declined to attend his 50th reunion, refusing interviews and photo requests.</span></p> <p><span>The break with Harvard occurred in the midst of the Vietnam War. Many of Kissinger's Harvard colleagues vehemently opposed his policies as secretary of state, leading many to speculate that political bitterness has created a permanent rift between Kissinger and the University.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Years of Service </b><p> </p></font>Kissinger is best known for his work as a diplomat in the 1960s and 1970s.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>An expert on the defense policy, he advised presidential administrations from 1955 to 1968, before officially joining Nixon's staff. He received international recognition for his studies of the Cold War. In the 1960 work <i>The Necessity for Choice</i>, he originated the \"missile  gap\" hypothesis, and he was later instrumental in engineering the first  strategic arms limitation talks (SALT) between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1969.</span></p> <p><span>With his official entrance into the government as Nixon's national security advisor, Kissinger became one of the primary crafters of  United States policy in Vietnam, facing the protests of numerous anti-war activists.</span></p> <p><span>But Kissinger's lengthy negotiations in 1973 brought about the final cease-fire of the war and engineered peace between North and South Vietnam. For his efforts, Kissinger shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Le Duc Tho of North Vietnam.</span></p> <p><span>In addition, Kissinger played an instrumental role in opening relations with the People's Republic of China.

Schelling, then a professor of economics, led the delegation.</span></p> <p><span>\"I had the impression that he was very deeply affected by what we told him,\" says Schelling, who is currently Distinguished University Professor at the University of Maryland. \"I would say it was somewhat emotionally charged because they were all people who had considered him a friend and a colleague...[and] on the whole the group was essentially breaking relations with him.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"He sank lower and lower in his chair, and his face lost color,\" Schelling recalls. \"When we went out I thought we had a significant impact, but I never saw any evidence afterward.\"</span></p> <p><span>Kissinger remained silent during most of the 90 minutes meeting, refusing to speak openly about the administration's policies.</span></p> <p><span>\"[The meeting] did not go well,\" says Huntington, who did not attend the meeting but has remained in touch with Kissinger. \"Henry has never gotten over it.\"</span></p> <p><span>Schelling says he did not speak with Kissinger again until the Carter Administration.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard students also blasted Kissinger for his role in the Vietnam War.

{"title": "Rethinking the Primaries | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In a nation committed to democracy, the increasingly undemocratic character of our presidential primaries is a matter of serious concern. Both Vice President Al Gore '69 and Texas Gov. George W. Bush had their parties' nominations in the bag by March 7, before half of eligible voters had even had a chance to make their voices heard. This system is not \"one man, one vote.\" And so we welcome a recent Republican committee proposal, the so-called Delaware plan, as a definite step in the right direction.</span></p> <p><span>Winning the party nomination means winning enough delegates to the party's convention. In the current system, states engage in a \"race to the bottom\"--or a \"race to the front\"--pushing primaries back so their residents can cast votes that count. The result is called \"front loading.\" Such a top-heavy primary process, in which few Americans cast votes that will matter, can hardly serve as an adequate test of a candidate's fitness for national office. In 1980, 21 percent of convention delegates were selected by March 15. Today, 63 percent are. A front-loaded process also leads to the current grim spectacle of a seven-month-long general election campaign.</span></p> <p><span>In contrast, the Delaware Plan would let small-population states such as Rhode Island and Alaska go first (after the traditional Iowa and New Hampshire primaries), medium states next, and so on through four successive stages that culminate with large states like California, Texas and New York.  By the end of the process in June, only 53 percent of the delegates would have been selected before the big boys weighed in.</span></p> <p><span>That means more debate. No more mad dash for Super Tuesday, after which the anointed can sit back and indulge the party's remaining primary voters in smug contentment. Every state would count, so even the front-runner would have to dig his heels in till the end--sweating, debating, persuading. Since smaller states are usually cheaper to campaign in, gone too would be the financial blitz in which a big-money candidate splurges early to knock his or her opponent out at the start. The Delaware Plan would make losing the first few primaries, currently an automatic disqualification, politically feasible. Again, the result would be longer, and therefore presumably more thoughtful, debate.</span></p> <p><span>However, the plan faces opposition. Some Republicans, concerned for states' rights, have objected to the plan's coercive enforcement provisions, under which states whose legislatures do not adopt the plan could lose some 50 to 90 percent of their convention delegates. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, has expressed only tepid interest in the plan and is giving greater consideration to a geographically-based rather than population-based system.  We urge both parties to reconsider.  As the establishments of each party have an interest in preserving the status quo, only bipartisan support can push the Delaware Plan into effect.</span></p> <p><span>Primaries, after all, were initially intended to get rid of the smoke-filled back room, the political machine--and to make American politics more democratic. The Delaware Plan should help them truly do so.</span></p>"}

{"title": "A Humanizing Moment | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I have a story about my Nana. Her name is Margaret, and I switched to calling her that as soon as I could pronounce it and she would let me. Margaret was home with my sister and I between when school let out and when my parents got home, helping to do some chores but mostly watching us play and bringing us goodies</span></p> <p><span>Margaret is Italian and Catholic. She takes both very seriously, and we always knew it--whether she was cooking up a frittata or giving me a book on the story of Christmas as a Chanukah present, which fed my early interest in all sorts of religions. We would receive Easter baskets and she would come to the family Passover seders. Margaret is definitely family.</span></p> <p><span>Naturally, when someone becomes a part of your family, you learn about their family. I knew Margaret's two grandsons as soon as I met her, each a few years older than me. Margaret would sometimes call me by their names and then chide herself for getting older and forgetful.</span></p> <p><span>I bring up my Nana to talk about April, or rather, April as Gay Pride Month. Margaret probably would never associate herself with the concept--at least not before last year. One of her grandsons shared a house with another young man; that made sense to Margaret because he was an unmarried twenty-something, and it made sense that he wouldn't tell his grandmother anything more. But last summer, when the grandson and his partner decided to adopt a child, it was time someone spilled the beans.</span></p> <p><span>Margaret is a regular at Mass as well as at the diocese's bingo; her beliefs are deeply rooted. When she learned that not only was the roommate not just a roommate but also that she was about to become an adoptive great-grandmother, it all came as quite a shock.</span></p> <p><span>But what is most remarkable is what happened next.</span></p> <p><span>Last August, after being briefed on all these developments by my mother, I went out for brunch with Margaret, a ritual for the age who still respond as her \"babies.\" The conversation turned to the adopted great-grandson. She admitted at first she had been shocked by it all and somewhat repulsed, but she said now all of that was brushed aside by a more pressing concern: How would this be for the baby?</span></p> <p><span>Margaret told me that she considered her opinions of her grandson's lifestyle almost irrelevant. It wouldn't be the choice she would make, she said, and it did disappoint her somewhat, but that was water under the bridge at this point, after the surprise. Now what she worried about was the little boy, and how he would grow up. After all, she said, doesn't every child need a mother?</span></p> <p><span>Last week, I called Margaret and asked how her great-grandson was. She said she had seen him earlier in the week, and that he was \"just adorable\" (correct great-grandmother intonation is impossible in print) and seemed to be growing up happy and healthy. She said she was even a little jealous of the fathers' relationship with the boy. \"When he sees me he cries and wants to go with one of the two daddies,\" she said.</span></p> <p><span>I find it moving that someone so close to me, who in the abstract would find homosexuality wrong, even sinful, honestly reconsidered her position when it became personal. Margaret's thoughts are mostly with the child, but her thoughts about homosexuality in general have changed too. She has been convinced that these two men can serve as good parents--quite an endorsement in child-rearing, to be approved of by such an expert.</span></p> <p><span>Her story came to mind last week when I was on the bus with two friends and one casually mentioned her sister and her sister-in-law. The third friend asked about a brother, but I had already caught it: \"'Sister-in-law' just sounds more human than 'partner,'\" she explained.</span></p> <p><span>It may be hard to think in these terms--subtle, private, human. The most visible part of Gay Pride Month at Harvard was the racy, shocking posters put up in the Yard by the Bisexual Gay Lesbian Transgendered and Supporters Alliance (BGLTSA), and though I think they had a point, I feel too that the piece of the BGLTSA agenda pursued in these posters was put forward at the cost of humanizing the issue--of confronting homosexuality via your sister, say, or your roommate.</span></p> <p><span>And humanity is of the essence. Whether it is Margaret and her grand-son-in-law or my friend and her sister-in-law, it is our common humanity that can bring us to dialogue. Even rabid conservative Phyllis Schafly has reconsidered her positions somewhat by knowing that her son is gay; candidate Bush came away from meetings with gay Republicans last week more \"educated\" on the issue.</span></p> <p><span>With her grandson, Margaret has looked beyond doctrine and politics to see people. In that case, her grandson and family have made tough decisions, and tried to live with the social and religious backlash they can expect and the family backlash they feared. Margaret decided to see the grandson she has always loved and to welcome his partner and child into their family. In the waning days of Gay Pride Month we should consider how we, can look at the challenges the gay rights movement faces and see the opportunities for change it creates--and how our words and actions affect people and not just issues.</span></p> <p><span><i>Adam I.

{"title": "Choosing the Right Vice | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>If they can manage to forget about Elian Gonzalez for a few days, Vice President Al Gore '69 and Texas Gov. George W. Bush should continue to develop their general election advertising strategies, decide the issues that will define their candidacies and consider their options for the vice presidency.</span></p> <p><span>In the past several elections, the vice-presidential candidates have had little or no impact. Jack Kemp utterly failed to create excitement for the 1996 Dole ticket, and Gore has a tough time being exciting about almost anything. In all fairness, Gore did a solid job in the 1992 vice presidential debates, but his presence on the ticket wasn't instrumental in President Clinton's election success.</span></p> <p><span>This year, however, has the potential to change the trend. On the Republican side, Bush came out of his primary battle with Arizona Sen. John S. McCain appearing extremely frail in several areas, most notably foreign policy. Whereas McCain had a clear and coherent grasp of geopolitics, Bush was badly bruised by failing his hot spot pop quiz. In the primary race, Bush claimed to have extensive international relations experience with Mexico. This may, however, ring hollow in a general election against a two-term vice president who has spent the last eight years personally dealing with the very leaders that Bush cannot name.</span></p> <p><span>It would therefore behoove Bush to ask General Colin Powell (Ret.) to join his White House ticket. With extensive experience in foreign and military affairs as a general and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Powell would add credibility to a Republican ticket that may otherwise lack substance. In addition, some of his more liberal social positions would allow the Republicans to appeal to a wider base than the GOP traditionally attracts. Moreover, Powell is already well known around the country. Bush's father chose an obscure and illiterate Indiana Senator as his running mate. George W., however, cannot afford to make a similar mistake.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, Powell has denied  any interest in the number two slot. Even so, candidates have a history of changing their mind when confronted with a genuine ticket offer. Bush ought to spare no effort to try to convince Powell to join him. If Powell can be persuaded to enter the campaign, he would transform an otherwise unremarkable ticket into a formidable adversary for Gore.</span></p> <p><span>On the other side of the aisle, Gore emerged victorious from an easier primary contest, but his campaign finance indiscretions over the last eight years--not to mention his connection to President Clinton--leave him vulnerable to attacks on his character. Gore's attempt to make campaign finance reform the centerpiece of his campaign is more laughable than his claim to have invented the Internet. Gore's choice for Vice President should instill a dose of idealism into a race sorely lacking it.</span></p> <p><span>One prominent person who would invigorate the ticket is former Maine Sen. George J. Mitchell. Mitchell has extensive legislative and government experience: He was the Senate majority leader for five years. In the Senate, he worked tirelessly on the Clean Air Act, the Iran-Contra affair and health care legislation. Most importantly, Mitchell was a prominent mediator and architect of the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland. His efforts in this area have shown him to be a selfless public servant dedicated to peaceful resolution of the most prickly international issues. \"[Mitchell] makes it a special ticket,\" said Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, who has attempted to enlist other mayors in the push to promote Mitchell.</span></p> <p><span>Like Powell, Mitchell has demurred when asked if he would accept a vice presidential nomination. \"There are many others who would be far more attractive,\" he said when asked about the possibility. However, these comments may be nothing more than humble denials of an offer that has not yet been put on the table. If he could be convinced to run, he would be an invaluable asset to the Democratic campaign.</span></p> <p><span>Powell and Mitchell are both remarkable individuals and would be superb additions to their respective tickets--if they can be persuaded to join the race. To be sure, they are not the only favorable candidates. Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel is a Vietnam veteran and campaign finance reformer straight from the McCain mold. On a Bush ticket, he would likely appeal to many of the same voters that McCain was able to bring into the political arena. California Sen. Diane Feinstein has also had a distinguished legislative career and supports gun control, abortion rights and health care initiatives. Either would be solid additions to the respective campaigns, but neither carries the overwhelming appeal of Powell and Mitchell.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, it appears to be an uphill battle to convince either of them to accept the vice presidential spot. In a presidential campaign with so few other likely highlights, however, participation by these two accomplished figures would bring back some interest and excitement to the campaign.</span></p> <p><span><i>David M.

McCain have dropped out of the race, however, Gore and Bush should start making concrete higher education-related proposals, Casey says.</span></p> <p><span>Terry W. Hartle, the senior vice president of the American Council on Education, a trade association which represents 1,800 colleges and universities including Harvard, says that substantive proposals are not the basis of this campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\"We're going to have an election that will focus more on personality than policy,\" Hartle says. \"I think that [concrete plans] will develop in more detail over the next couple of months.\"</span></p> <p><span>But it may be that the candidates find little to change.</span></p> <p><span>The current administration is primarily interested in improving higher education through greater student aid and investments in scientific research and technology, Hartle says.</span></p> <p><span>He adds that the \"general thinking\" is that the education policies now in effect are, on the whole, successful.</span></p> <p><span>Thus, the candidates are intent on tinkering, not on sweeping reforms.</span></p> <p><span>Historically, things have been different, Hartle says. In 1988, Democratic nominee Michael S. Dukakis came up with a comprehensive plan for an income-contingent student loan program, which was a central facet of his campaign until the election.</span></p> <p><span>\"We haven't seen that [type of program] yet from either candidate, and with the exception of elementary and secondary education, it's not clear that we will,\" Hartle says.</span></p> <p><span>He adds that an unusual dichotomy has developed on the campaign trail: while federal support for student aid and university research has never been higher, neither candidate is talking about higher education very much.</span></p> <p><span>\"The existing policy mechanisms seem to be working reasonably well,\" Hartle says.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>On the Issues </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Although the two major candidates have said little about their higher education plans, a few trends have emerged for education in elementary, middle and high school.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Forced to the right by McCain's surprisingly strong challenge in the Republican primaries, Bush is now racing towards the center for the November general election.</span></p> <p><span>Though education has traditionally been a Democratic issue, Bush--who presided over an educational renaissance in Texas--is hoping to challenge Gore for education-minded voters in November.</span></p> <p><span>Unlike many Republicans, Bush wants to keep the Department of Education, and even wants to expand it by making Head Start, a child development program, one of its programs.</span></p> <p><span>Education is \"an issue that is particularly important to your less partisan, more independent-minded voters,\" said Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesperson, in yesterday's New York Times.</span></p> <p><span>Hartle says such maneuvering towards the center is \"not the least bit surprising,\" as it happens in every presidential election.</span></p> <p><span>Bush needs Democratic and independent votes to get elected, just as Gore does, he says.</span></p> <p><span>The centerpiece of Bush's education platform is his \"affirmative access\" program. As part of this program, a state law signed by Bush in 1997 requires Texas public colleges and universities to admit the top 10 percent of graduates from each of the state's high schools.</span></p> <p><span>\"I support what I call 'affirmative access'--not quotas, not double standards, because those divide and balkanize, but access--a fair shot for every single person,\" Bush told The Chronicle of Higher Education in February.</span></p> <p><span>Bush admits that equal access doesn't guarantee equal results, but says that his legislation means that every student will get a \"fair shot\" based on their potential and merit.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's \"affirmative access\" plan is catching on around the country. California, which, like Texas, no longer uses affirmative action, adopted a class-rank plan last year, while public college leaders in Florida approved a top-20-percent policy under Governor Jeb Bush in late February.</span></p> <p><span>But Bush's \"affirmative access\" replacement for the Democrats' bread-and-butter affirmative action remains untested on the national level.</span></p> <p><span>\"The top-10-percent plan works as well as it has because of a very unfortunate situation--we still have de-facto segregated schools,\" Bruce Walker, University of Texas at Austin's director of admissions, told The Chronicle.</span></p> <p><span>As a result of his program, \"more of the minority students who did attend selective schools would be from low income segregated backgrounds and fewer from integrated and suburban schools,\" according to Gary A. Orfield, Professor of Education and Social Policy at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Bush also wants to expand Pell Grants--federal grants to financial aid students--and has proposed \"education savings accounts\" through which parents would be given a $5,000 each year to save for their children's tuition.</span></p> <p><span>For the most part, however, Bush favors local control of the nation's schools.</span></p> <p><span>Gore, meanwhile, is following in the footsteps of President Clinton.</span></p> <p><span>\"Basically the Gore higher ed proposals are same as the Clinton agenda--a strong focus on making more loans and scholarships available particularly to the middle class and high scoring students, a modest increase in aid for poor students, and a continued support for affirmative action,\" Orfield wrote in an e-mail message.</span></p> <p><span>The central feature of Gore's plan thus far is his \"National Tuition Savings\" plan, which would allow parents to invest money free of tax in preparation for their child's college bills.</span></p> <p><span>\"We should allow each parent's savings to be used in any participating state, and use incentives to encourage states that do not have the programs to create them,\" Gore said in May 1999. \"Under this plan, if you make small, regular contributions to the program after your child's birth, you'll be able to afford college tuition--with protection from taxes, inflation, and rising college costs.\"</span></p> <p><span>Gore says he plans to continue several programs begun during the Clinton Administration and wants to increase Pell Grants to help low-income students.</span></p> <p><span>\"I am proud of the fact that our Hope Scholarship, Lifetime Learning Tax Credits and substantial increases in Pell Grants have opened the doors of college for millions of Americans,\" Gore told The Chronicle.</span></p> <p><span>But Gore's program is also more centrist than a traditional Democrat's--a reflection of the \"New Democrat\" ideology that got the Clinton-Gore ticket twice elected to the nation's highest offices.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Clinton-Gore program is much more conservative than earlier Democratic programs in that it does not make a high priority of keeping access to college open for low income and working class students,\" Orfield wrote. \"The social class gaps in college access and completion of broadened substantially in the last two decades.\"</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>The Harvard Angle </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Orfield says that Gore's few higher education proposals fit in nicely with Harvard's policies.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>\"As far as Harvard students go, it is a strong positive program for most of them, including the tax exempt status of some tuition debt payments,\" Orfield wrote.</span></p> <p><span>But Casey says it is \"hard to glean conclusions from campaign-type situations\" in terms of how the candidates' proposals would affect Harvard's policies.</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, his office has been heavily involved in the campaign.

{"title": "The Death of the Fourth Amendment | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In the wake of the Diallo and Louima rulings and the Dorismond shooting, New York Mayor Rudy Guiliani needs to see his supposed success as a failure. His perceived accomplishments in improving the \"quality of life\" in New York are, in reality, abuses of police discretion and the perpetuation of a racial double standard in law enforcement.</span></p> <p><span>For whites, Guiliani's improved \"quality of life\" may be manifested in the form of cleaner streets, fewer \"broken windows\" and a marked decline in subway turnstile jumpers. For blacks and latinos, it means--at best--routine harassment and frisks with decreased Fourth Amendment rights. At worst, it means 41 shots by four heavily armed policemen for the crime of being black and carrying a wallet.</span></p> <p><span>Consistent enforcement of misdemeanor violations of a targeted kind is not in itself a bad idea. Even if a hefty fine for turnstile jumping seems draconian in comparison with other cities' policies, no civil liberties are violated if an existing law is aggressively but uniformly enforced. The \"broken windows\" theory articulated by James Q. Wilson and George Kelling is not intrinsically problematic: disorder does cause fear, which eliminates social control, inviting illicit activities. And it seems to be working: violent crime is down 49 percent in New York, compared with seven percent in Chicago and six percent in Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span>But this victory is a pyrrhic if the costs are our constitutional rights and the racially-neutral law enforcement in America. Focusing on disorderly offenses has permitted and indeed invited over-zealous and discriminatory street policing of the kind that led to the Diallo tragedy and daily indignities. According to the state attorney general, blacks are stopped 2.1 times more often than whites in New York.</span></p> <p><span>The new policing in New York was made possible by a string of recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions that have increased police discretion and permitted law enforcement agents to circumvent the spirit of the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures and the Fourteenth Amendment's assurance of equal protection. In only the most upsetting of recent string of decisions, the court ruled in Whren v . U.S. that the police were not out of line when they used a minor crime as a pretext for stopping someone whom they found suspicious without an articulable basis for that suspicion. Writing for the majority, Justice Scalia held that when a police officer actually arrests a driver for a traffic violation and then searches the vehicle, a Fourth Amendment-based motion to suppress evidence of other crimes will not prevail even if--based on an objective standard--police officers do not usually arrest people for that kind of misdemeanor.</span></p> <p><span>Whren lowered the bar for the kind of articulable suspicion police officers needed to have to conduct a search. As long as they are willing to arrest the suspect for any minor violation they can find, the Supreme Court have been given police too much room to use racial profiling. Another case, U.S. v. Weaver, made race an acceptable part of the articulable suspicion required for a Drug Enforcement Agency deputy to stop a nervous-looking suspected drug-courier in an airport when flying from a source city and purchasing his ticket with cash. Utilizing race as an acceptable component of an officer's decision to stop someone for behavior typical of a large number of innocent people has shocking ramifications for law enforcement across the country. If this precedent is expanded, the legislature might as well make \"driving while black\" a crime on the books, because the equal protection clause will cease to mean anything in American jurisprudence.</span></p> <p><span>In a few cases, the court has upheld  Fourth Amendment rights, but only in striking down the most outrageous and vague ordinances. On the whole, the court is not limiting discretion so much as teaching police departments the rules. In Whren and Weaver, the court is sending a strong signal to cities that they will give broad latitude to racial profiling. Tell me a story, they say. Make it borderline believable, and we will deny motions to dismiss on the basis of Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment challenges when minorities claim unreasonable searches and discriminatory treatment.</span></p> <p><span>Most police officers are not racist. A civilized society must place a high priority on law enforcement for reasons of deterrence and justice. But these decisions threaten the protections inherent in the Constitution and leaves all citizens vulnerable to the abuses of an aberrant--but brutal--minority of law enforcement officials. The Constitution only protects us from these abuses if the courts respect its spirit.</span></p> <p><span>Who is to blame for Diallo? The four white police officers, who shot a man holding a wallet; the system of accountability, put in place by former New York Police Commissioner William Bratton, puts intense pressure on officers to bring down crime at any price; wannabe-Senator Rudy Guiliani; and most importantly, the Supreme Court. While some feel there is not much of a policy difference between George W. Bush and Al Gore '69, there is a significant difference on this issue. With as many as three seats on the Supreme Court likely to come open in the next four years, the future of race relations in the U.S. could hang in the balance.</span></p> <p><span><i>Quentin A.

A pink pig with dreams of rising in the ranks to work for social justice all across the land.</span></p> <p><span>But when Henrietta applies to a certain esteemed law school in Cambridge, she is rejected without a second thought.</span></p> <p><span>The porcine heroine of <i>Henrietta</i>, Pulitzer Prize-winner David Mamet's eponymous children's book, appeals to both children and adults alike. Since its publication this winter, it has proven popular in Cambridge--an employee of the Harvard Coop says the book continues to be a strong seller.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think a lot of Harvard students are buying the book...in addition to parents buying the book for the children,\" the Coop's Yasser Cruywagen says.</span></p> <p><span>That might be because beneath the simple story, many readers have detected something else: a jab at elitism and discrimination within Harvard, the \"Great University\" on the banks of the Charles.</span></p> <p><span>In the story, Henrietta is a promising, intelligent pig who applies to a school that curiously resembles Harvard Law School.</span></p> <p><span>Lacking credentials, the school has no time to teach her despite her \"honest and inquiring mind.\"</span></p> <p><span>Not willing to give up, Henrietta haunts the university's libraries until she has been \"discovered one too many times\" and is barred permanently, a \"No Pigs\" sign hung over a gray and forbidding door.</span></p> <p><span>She takes to the streets, sightseeing and sleeping under moonlight by the Charles River. Finally despondent, she resigns herself to a life of homelessness, wondering \"what she might have done to have come to another end.\"</span></p> <p><span>Finally, Henrietta finds some good fortune, as she comes upon an \"Old Vagabond\" sitting on a park bench who has lost his glasses. The search proves \"bootless,\" but she walks the president of the \"Great University\" home--and by recognizing his references to Hamlet and Oedipus Rex earns his respect.</span></p> <p><span>Henrietta promptly gains admittance to the law school, finishes first in her class, and ends up on the U.S. Supreme Court.</span></p> <p><span>The story's adult tone has fueled speculation that it's not just for kids.

{"title": "Sundance v. Tumbler, Round One | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The following memorandum was leaked to me by a high-level government source:</span></p> <p><span>MEMORANDUM</span></p> <p><span>To: All Employees, United States Secret Service</span></p> <p><span>From: Brian L. Stafford, Director</span></p> <p><span>Re: New Code Names</span></p> <p><span>As Director of the Secret Service, I write to inform you of the decision on  Secret Service code names for the 2000 Presidential candidates.</span></p> <p><span>Candidate George W. Bush shall hereafter be referred to as \"Tumbler.\"</span></p> <p><span>Candidate Al Gore shall hereafter be referred to as \"Sundance.\"</span></p> <p><span>As you know, the Secret Service as a matter of general policy makes no official comment on the reasons for code name selection, or the process by which code names are decided. However, I would like to take this opportunity to attempt to clear up some misunderstandings about the issue of code names, and establish a general policy on code name use.</span></p> <p><span>First, I would like to address the decision to use the code name \"Tumbler.\"  At first glance, one might think that this would be a code name more appropriately applied to former President Gerald Ford. However, in consultation with longtime Secret Service employees and in checking past files, I have yet found no one in this agency, or even in the federal government at large, who remembers Gerald Ford's code name. It is unclear whether anyone even remembers that Ford was President of the United States.  In light of this, I believe the name \"Tumbler\" can safely be applied to the present candidate.</span></p> <p><span>I would also like to take this opportunity to establish an official policy on the use of alternative code names. In 1992, a renegade cadre of Secret Service employees, in direct contradiction of official Service policy, began to refer to our current President, Eagle, as \"Elvis.\" Apparently, these employees particularly enjoyed saying the phrase \"Elvis has left the building\" into their wrist microphones. This practice, in addition to creating confusion among protective details, created a climate of mistrust between Eagle and the Service, a mistrust unfortunately exacerbated by the leaking of the lamp-throwing story.</span></p> <p><span>As director of the Secret Service, I would like to ensure that this sort of insubordination does not occur again.  Therefore, official action will be taken against any employee who uses any code name other than the officially designated one to refer to the candidates. Particularly harsh action will be taken against anyone who refers to candidate Sundance as \"Timber,\" \"Maple,\" or any other arboristically derived term. The names \"Android,\" \"Hal,\" and their ilk are also expressly prohibited in reference to Sundance. Similarly, any reference to candidate Tumbler as \"Shrub,\" \"Junior,\" or \"Preppy\" will be acted on accordingly.</span></p> <p><span>It has been brought to my attention that a number of employees have participated in a betting pool in anticipation of the code name decision. I would like to take this opportunity to remind these employees that the use of federal property, including copiers, e-mail accounts and desk chairs, for any sort of gambling activity, is in violation of federal law.   Please note that, contrary to rumor, contributions to the federal government investment plan do not fall under the definition of \"gambling activity\" under federal law.</span></p> <p><span>Any employee who has not yet received training on the correct use of Official Secret Service Code Names may wish to attend the session that will be held next Wednesday at 2:30 in the main auditorium. Topics covered will include code name spelling and pronunciation, as well as the use of code names in the Lotus Notes environment. Due to the department's cost-cutting measures, this training session will be combined with the previously scheduled session on the correct use of the new ergonomic desk chairs. I urge you all to make a special effort to attend this session, as it is truly vital to the mission of the Service.</span></p> <p><span>I appreciate your cooperation in this very important matter.</span></p> <p><span><i>Noelle Eckley '00 is an environmental science and public policy concentrator in Dunster House.

{"title": "The Nineties Meet The Teens | Arts | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>I should begin this article with a confession. Sometimes, when my reading list subjects me to the dense texts of Marx's Capital or Weber's Economy and Society: Part One, I turn to the culture of the American teenage youth for salvation and sanity. Always trying to maintain a modicum of intellectual decorum among the stoic philosophes of Lamont or Hilles, within the leaves of these difficult volumes, I am forced to hide the waxy, radioactively luminous pages of the contemporary social journal otherwise known as Teen Beat. I shamefully indulge in evaluating the subtleties of e-mails sent between Britney Spears and Prince William, absorbing every tidbit of insight regarding potential lovebirds Joey and Pacey, and critiquing Christina Aguilera's newest 'do (yup, she is still ugly). Like sneaking crack cocaine across the border, I must adeptly shroud the zine behind the German intellectual tradition so that the library checker or a curious student does not catch a glimpse of my sinful adolescent delight.</span></p> <p><span>Magazines like Teen Beat have not changed much over the ages. Where the visages of Kurt Cameron, Debbie Gibson and Jordan Knight once stood now stand James \"Cut Your Hair\" Van Der Beek, Jessica Simpson and, um, Jordan Knight. But one aspect that has changed significantly in the past few years is the coverage of music. Traditionally obsessed with teen pop sensations, Teen Beat, J-14 and other teen trash journals have assimilated the world of alternative rock into its corpus of cool kids.</span></p> <p><span>Two bands that have recently received extensive coverage from these zines are No Doubt and Korn. Eight years ago, neither could ever imagine being elevated to such a lofty status. No Doubt was still skankin' it up in Orange County, Calif., intimately tied to the punk-rock-ska-reggae stylings of Long Beachers Bradley Nowell and Sublime. If No Doubt was recognized at all, it was for their collaborations with Sublime on \"Total Hate\" and \"Saw Red,\" certainly not for their first self-titled release. Gwen Stefani was hardly a sex icon, but rather trapped within a wardrobe that borrowed from the worst parts of new wave and grunge. She was just a girl, whether or not she'd rather not be.</span></p> <p><span>The status of hardcore ringmaster Korn was even more precarious. The explosion of grunge sent dark, disturbing, angry metal back into the goth-loving, cape-wearing, motorcycle riding, Dungeons and Dragons playing pit from whence it came. An early release by Kid Rock (you thought Devil Without a Cause was his first album?) got hammered by the angstful, flanneled, head-banging juggernaut that was \"Here we are now, entertain us.\" But Mr. Hick-Hop was not the only rocker that suffered. Metallica was temporarily uncool and Megadeth was mega-dead. Meanwhile, Korn was chillin' on the West Coast in Bakersfield, Calif., gathering up rage motivated by not having dates to awkward high school formals, jealousy towards big jock bullies and their hot cheerleader girlfriends, and tolerating parents that would not let them smoke dope and swear. Their question: when would hate-rock rule again?</span></p> <p><span>The mid-'90s were good to both No Doubt and Korn. The glorification of alternative rock assisted by a fatal self-inflicted bullet wound to Kurt Cobain sent record companies, radio stations, and teenagers into an alterna-frenzy. Perfect timing landed both bands with a series of chart-topping singles. No Doubt titillated the lighter souls with \"Just a Girl,\" \"Spider Web\" and \"Don't Speak,\" while Korn captured the darker souls with \"Blind,\" \"Shoots and Ladders,\" and \"Clown.\" Gwen Stefani excited, Jonathan Davis incited and new modern rock heroes were born.</span></p> <p><span>And now, half a decade later, No Doubt and Korn are still on top of their games. No Doubt continued to feed off of the success of Tragic Kingdom, releasing nominally successful singles like \"Excuse Me Mister\" and \"Sunday Morning.\" Who knew that a little red dress and some fruit could go so far? The recently released Return of Saturn boasts two wildly successful singles already, namely \"New\" and \"Ex-Girlfriend.\" The prolific nay-sayer Korn has released three albums since their self-titled debut, with the recent Issues topping charts with the single \"Falling Away from Me.\"</span></p> <p><span>But this time, things are different. The culture of the teeny-bopper to dominance in full-force, wielding enough market power to induce every radio station, record company, and teen magazine to cater to their every need. And what they want, in addition to cottom candy pop and boy bands are No Doubt and Korn. Page after page of Teen Beat and J-14 oogle at the pink-haired princess Stefani and her hunky (ex?)boyfriend, Bush leader singer Gavin Rossdale or the sultry darkness and misogynistic masculinity of Korn and fellow bad-asses Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock.</span></p> <p><span>Could millennial teeny boppers be truly obsessed with mid-'90s alterna-icons? Are they only interested in the radio hits, the popular albums, or does their love run deeper? Only by going to a live concert and experiencing a band face-to-face can an individual show true devotion, admiration and understanding of the music and the artist? In other words, are these teens willing to get in the pit and try to love someone? Over Spring Break 2000, this was the question I intended to answer. Two days, two shows, one reporter: No Doubt, Korn, the teens and me.</span></p> <p><span>NO DOUBT ABOUT IT</span></p> <p><span>The evening of Wednesday, March 29, was cold. Too many evenings of freezing my ass off in long lines in front of Avalon waiting for Avaland made me none too quick to arrive much earlier than doors at seven. The event was general admission, and as all seasoned concertgoers know, unless you want the very front row at a small club, there is no reason why early arrival is imperative. But I had forgotten that the show was all-ages, and most of those present were under 18. The line in front of Avalon horizontally stretched back to Jillian's by seven, but vertically stretched rarely above 5'8\". Herded behind a rope fence to infinity, the menagerie of miniature mods impatiently waited for the doors to open and the doubting to end.</span></p> <p><span>Two girls, no older than 14, stood in front of me at the back of the line. \"It is so cold,\" said one to the other. Of course it is, honey. You are barely over five feet, barely over rattles and Gerber, and you are wearing nothing but a tiara, neon pink flowing genie pants, a pale pink almost see-through top, and a pimply, large-panted freshman boyfriend. Of course, the boyfriend responded to the statement spoken to the girls friend as an invitation for action. \"Don't worry, baby. I'll keep you warm,\" followed by a sloppy kiss and a scrawny arm around her body. Smooth move, Barry White.</span></p> <p><span>Behind me were two more high school girls, these a little older, a little less glam, and a little more awkward. \"We don't have tickets,\" they say to me. \"Do you have any extras?\" I told them that I did not, and I thought the show was sold out. \"Yes, we know, but her Mom (points to friend) said we might be able to get some from a scalper.\" Your mom? Are you serious? I told her that if there were any scalper, they would hit the front of the line or the corner of Landsdowne and Yawkey. \"Yeah, but we don't want to lose our space in line.\" Did they already forget that they didn't have tickets? Was there mom Gwen Stefani or something?</span></p> <p><span>Finally, the doors open and the crowd spilled into the posh offerings of Boston's finest in dance and sparkle. A head or so taller than most other concertgoers, I had a good view of the scene. But there was not much to see. The crowd was almost entirely female sixteen and under. Two middle-schoolers clung to one another as they sifted through the crowd, proudly sporting matching No Doubt T-shirt and tight black pant outfits. At this moment, a horrible thought crossed my mind. What if No Doubt doesn't play instruments anymore? What if they just sit on stools, wear matching costumes (adorned with some individualizing accessory, of course) and sing love medleys? I was afraid this cotton candy crowd would scream the entire in a deafening tone, as though being stabbed.</span></p> <p><span>I had seen No Doubt only four short years ago in a small club in Providence, and the crowd was nothing like this one. They were bigger, older, rougher, more ska-core and punk. The floor then was not violent by Rage Against the Machine standards, catering more to the more gentle colliding of a skank pit. At that time, the opening band was Goldfinger, a light-hearted, prankish, oft-nude precursor to Blink-182. This time, the openers were not nearly as friendly. But the presence of the Suicide Machines did not scare off any of the teenage girls. Rather, the presence of the teenage girls lulled the Suicide Machines into a half-hearted set, ripping through their songs without many notorious onstage antics, preferring the pleasures of post-show backstage to the distracted interest of a crowd simply waiting for Gwen. But the members of the faceless minor crowd were not the only ones at the concert in love with Gwen. At a table towards the back of Avalon, Rossdale inconspicuously and his large Asian friend had a few drinks, noticed only by a perceptive Crimson Arts writer and the bartenders.</span></p> <p><span>With Kurt Loder and MTV cameras at their backs, No Doubt strolled on stage. Sans cosmetic braces, Stefani coyly flirted with the first few notes of \"New\" before surging into the quick paced skank-adelic pop. Instead of bumping and moving, the little ravers were content with singing along to every word. Stefani pranced around the stage to all the hits, spinning her \"Spider Web\" and tell us \"Don't Speak.\" Her attempts at flirting and posing for the crowd were uncharacteristically unsuccessful, as the mostly female crowd was more interested in bassist and Stefani ex-boyfriend Tony Kanal, the actual subject of the new single \"Ex-Girlfriend.\" When the crowd did start jumping for \"Excuse Me Mister\", the bouncers helped numerous smaller girls exit the sweaty madness, a series of altruistic actions that were first in my concert history. In a similar vein, the bouncers broke up even the smallest mosh pits, a sure sign that Avalon and No Doubt wanted the show to be family fun, a musical Make-a-Wish foundation set to ska-punk-pop. No Doubt rocked, but the crowd hardly moved.</span></p> <p><span>CARE FOR A KORN, DOG?</span></p> <p><span>This innocence and harmlessness was not to be found on Thursday night. With the tinted windows of my Mercury Sable and a crude tape of Nine Inch Nails's Further Down the Spiral, the next destination was the Centrum in the beautiful metropolis of Ye Olde Worcester. With the luxury an intimate small venue gone, I was forced to tolerate stadium seating and a snack bar at the rock concert. But the event, lovingly called the \"Sick and Twisted\" tour, was more a spectacle than a concert. At an outrageously early 6:30pm, Mindless Self Indulgence mounted the stage to rile up the pit. They did not have to do much. Sporting some of the largest, strongest, angriest, most steroid-filled men and women in New England, the pit was the most violent this side of the Running of the Bulls. Filling the entire rink floor, the predominantly shirtless Centrum patrons ripped into one another, forcing EMTs to rush to the aid of injured pit fighters within the first half hour. Springfield locals Staind shook some more red in front of the bulls, who were then calmed down by the following showing of \"Spike and Mike's Animation Festival.\"</span></p> <p><span>During this intermission, I had a chance to put down my defenses and survey the crowd. Most of the arena was filled with twentysomething males, some accompanied by barely-dressed girlfriends. Despite the presence of the fairer sex, these guy were here for some misogynistic, testosterone fun, and they were not going to let chivalry get in the way. I ask a guy next to me how he felt about seeing Korn. \"Dude, they are the fucking best every time I see them.\" How many times have you seen them? \"Every time they have been in New England.\" \"Every time? Like last night in Providence and tomorrow again here? \"Hells fucking yeah! Where else can I kick some ass and not get arrested for it? Oh, and then there is the stripshow!\" Stripshow?</span></p> <p><span>I had absorbed enough random nudity at Woodstock '99, but I was not prepared for what happened next. In between the animation and Korn, the cameras were turned on the crowd, focusing on the more attractive girls in the crowd. The moment the camera would focus, the girl (regardless of age, from 14 to 40) immediately flashed the entire crowd, to the catcalls and cheers of all. Two girls, riding on the shoulders of a few men in the pit, began making out and groping each other for the delight of all the shirtless males in the place. For 20 minutes, a constant stream of (hardly) consenting women revealed their bodies to a crowd of meatheads. Entertainment has reached a new level of something, though I do not know what.</span></p> <p><span>But the show must go on, and at nine the light went down and first six notes of \"Falling Away From Me\" were lost in an explosion of sound. Huge hairy men and small mascara-abusing girls screamed with estatic anticipation. Without wasting a moment of dialogue with the crowd, Korn blitzed through the set. Lasers, lights, an inflated rag doll, three video screen, and gigantic speakers pulsed through the crowd, throwing everyone into a bass beat thrashing. Bodies flew through the air in the pit, while Korn-dogs in the stands forced their way past guards onto the floor. Pandemonium ensued to the tune of \"Got the Life,\" \"A.D.I.D.A.S.,\" \"Faget\" and \"Freak on a Leash.\" After two encores, Korn finally closed with a supercharged version of \"Blind,\" eliciting more thrashing and tearing when one though the crowd must be out of energy. Four hours after in started, the war in the pit of the Worcester Centrum was over. The survivors smelt victory, the losers smelt the emergency room of the local hospitals. Count me in with the first group.</span></p> <p><span>So, the moral of the story? Despite the fact that Teen Beat and J-14 have embraced Korn's image, the readers cannot keep up with the live lifestyle. Unfortunately, No Doubt has fallen prey to the monster of mainstream appeal and teenybopper crowds. On the way out of the Centrum after Korn, I saw a small boy, barely eight, staring down at the emptying pit. \"Did you like the show?\" I asked the catatonic child. His father replied \"It was his first concert.\" Oh, that hurts. Should have picked No Doubt, my boy. Things may never be the same after Korn.</span></p>"}

For instance, Essential Selections, one of the major British DJ mix labels, announced that they're starting to release mix albums in the U.S. My question is, how come American compilations (\"Total Hits '99,\" etc.) are designed to look so much uglier than their glitzy British equivalents, even if the quality of songs is just as good (or bad)?

{"title": "What Thoreau Don't Know | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Near the beginning of <i>Walden</i>, Thoreau writes that \"it would be some advantage to live in a primitive and frontier life, though in the midst of an outward civilization, if only to learn what are the gross necessaries of life and what methods have been taken to obtain them.\" The irony, of course, is that now we would say even the most \"civilized\" mid-nineteenth-century American lived a life far more primitive than any imaginable today. No Coca-Cola (nor plastic bottle in which to hold it); no Gore-Tex jacket (nor zipper with which close it); no Chevy Blazer (nor asphalt on which to drive it). Really, how can you talk about gross necessaries when you haven't even been to Filene's Basement?</span></p> <p><span>Which brings me to my friend Ping, who not only drinks, dresses and drives  la mode but has an active hand in making sure modernity moves speedily forward.</span></p> <p><span>Ping is a purchasing analyst in the Non-Traditional Purchasing Department of a Fortune 500 food and beverage company. She graduated from college last June with a degree in industrial engineering, and started work in November. The function of her department, she told me, is to \"purchase anything that's not related to the end product.\" This might mean nuts and bolts for machinery, hairnets and uniforms for employees or adhesives and cardboard for packaging. The list runs into the tens of thousands: everything necessary to move from idea to product except for the product itself.</span></p> <p><span>In the eyes of the consumer, these products exemplify Thoreau's celebrated \"simplicity.\" The company's best-seller is a drink you can buy at Store 24 for a little over a dollar. Its two main ingredients are sugar and water, and it comes in a plastic bottle with a twist-off cap and coated wrap-around paper label. That's it.</span></p> <p><span>Behind the scenes, however, lurks complexity enough to daunt the TF for Math 55. For starters, 423 million gallons of this stuff are sold every day. A typical bottle holds about a quarter of a gallon. That's over a billion coated wrap-around paper labels to buy every morning. The Non-Traditional Purchasing Department does the buying, and they do it very carefully. When millions of dollars move with each font change, after all, the more MBA's the merrier. As Ping put it, \"Looking at a bottle, you wouldn't think hundreds of people did months of work just to switch a type of adhesive used in gluing the label to the bottle.\"</span></p> <p><span>Two years ago, a separate department for non-traditional purchases was only a circle on a new CEO's org chart. His goal, Ping explained, was \"to consolidate the supplier base\" and thereby \"leverage spending.\" In English, this meant that where once each of the company's manufacturing plants had different local suppliers, they would now buy every item in larger volumes at lower prices from one or two national suppliers. \"This seems to be the trend nowadays,\" Ping told me. \"In the beginning, they hired some consultants to do a diagnostic and found out there was a saving potential. Then the management set a target of $53 million in savings in two years for the department.\" These expected savings were to come by changing how--not what--the company purchased.</span></p> <p><span>In the specific case of the glue on the label, Ping's team sought their sellers online with the help of a dot-com \"market maker\" whose web page trumpets its expertise in \"business-to-business online auctions for buyers of industrial parts, raw materials, commodities and services.\" For every different adhesive needed to attach label to bottle, Ping said, \"they had at least four of five [online] bidders,\" each a national supplier. The winning bid represented a savings of 20 percent.</span></p> <p><span>Now, said Ping, \"they need to test [the new glues] in the R&amp;D facility and then in the [manufacturing] plants.\" In all, the intellectual assembly line will move from CEO to management consultant to purchasing analyst to materials buyer to development tester to factory overseer before the new process for gluing the label to the bottle is complete. It is exceedingly unlikely that any of the 423-million-gallon daily drinkers will notice a thing.</span></p> <p><span>\"Coming from an intellectual family, I am excited about ideas, but often don't respect enough what it takes to transform an idea to reality,\" Ping confessed. \"Everything is just so much more complicated than you think in school. [It's] a good reality check. To do well on this job requires a different set of intelligence from performing well in school: less abstract intelligence, but more people skill, common sense, just knowing how to get things done.\"</span></p> <p><span>I'll drink to that.</span></p> <p><span><i>Jeremy N.

{"title": "Spring Cleaning | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>So many important issues are on everyone's minds during this time of year, but I have only so few words allotted to this column. Here are a variety of things to ponder before exams and papers start stressing you out too much--a sort of spring cleaning for your brain:</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>I used to be one of these people who would feel great angst over the lack of interest in national news displayed by many Americans. However, poor little Elian Gonzalez radically changed my mind on this subject. Is this issue important? Yes. But the other day I arrived at the crux of the issue. A friend of mine, for whom I have the utmost respect in terms of keeping up with current events, flipped off Tom Brokaw's special afternoon update in favor of the highly intellectual Fox show \"Real TV.\" Seeing a 300-pound Marlin pull a man out of his fishing boat definitely felt more important to watch at that point than anything Janet Reno could have done or said with the family. This settled the issue for me; the media has drastically over-covered this event.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>With the new baseball season underway, residents of Boston and members of Red Sox nation have begun another clamor for the construction of a new stadium.  Allegedly, it will happen this time--they even have blueprints. But unless Boston Mayor Tom Menino and the Beacon Hill gang actually mobilize in the next few months, the situation will look awfully similar to the football stadium debacle last year that almost led to the Hartford Patriots. The Red Sox are a Boston institution. They ought to get the infrastructure that they want for this project. Everybody wins with a new stadium.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>If the powers that be at Harvard are serious about making efforts to improve undergraduate education, then the decision to deny Louise Richardson tenure still baffles me. As one of the students lucky enough to know Professor Richardson, I will be very sad to see her go. The commitment that she made to her students throughout her Government 1748 course and in her role as head tutor can only be described as remarkable. Granting her tenure would have added even more strength to the already strong government department as well as been a positive step in gaining gender equality among tenured professors.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>God bless the Independent Counsel law. Call this office any name you want, but maybe it will actually serve its purpose and give President Clinton what he deserves for his disgusting bastardization of the truth throughout the entire Monica S. Lewinsky scandal--that is, unless Al Gore '69 has anything to say about it. Right now, Clinton says he doesn't want a pardon if he faces criminal charges. And Al Gore has responded to the issue of pardoning his boss if elected president, a la Gerald Ford, by suggesting Clinton's response makes this a moot point. But the Slick One and the Inventor of the Internet have, at times, been a bit disingenuous. If Gore's tireless fundraising efforts ultimately land him the good office on Pennsylvania Ave, look for waffle number one to be the Clinton pardon.</span></p> <p><span>***</span></p> <p><span>In light of the latest local catastrophe, the mismanagement of the Central Artery Tunnel project (a.k.a. \"The Big Dig\"), it's nice to see that private citizens are taking it upon themselves to help serve the community at large. In this era of expanding government programs to levels that would make Thomas Jefferson cry, some prominent locals are doing great things without government involvement. Former 8th district congressman Joe Kennedy founded a non-profit organization called \"Citizen's Energy.\" The non-profit corporation uses entrepreneurial revenue to provide heating and oil to low-income families at up to 40 percent below market value.

Bush put himself in a tough position this past February when he sold his political soul to the devil--er, Pat Robertson--in exchange for a comeback victory in South Carolina. It seems to me that the easiest way for him to show people the compassionate part of his \"compassionate conservatism\" exists, is to choose the right running mate. Insisting on a pro-life running mate just won't work. One name no one seems to raise anymore because of her recent tough re-election battle is New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. She is everything the Republican party ought to be highlighting--an intelligent social moderate with a proven record.

{"title": "The Quality of Texas Justice | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>One of the first duties of government is to establish justice--impartial, independent justice that does not grant favors or privilege one party above another, justice that preserves a government of laws and not of men. One of the first duties of public officials is to ensure that such impartiality is maintained. Unfortunately, in the state of Texas, both the judiciary and the public officials who oversee it have failed in this fundamental task, sacrificing to political interest the principle of equality before the law.</span></p> <p><span>As in many states, judges in Texas are elected. In fact, Texas is one of only seven states where judges declare a party affiliation, and judges in Texas may accept limited contributions to their campaigns. Curiously, however, Texas specifically allows its judges to solicit and receive campaign contributions from lawyers and parties in cases currently appearing before them. And according to a recently filed federal lawsuit by the consumer-advocacy group Public Citizen, Texas law has no requirement that judges recuse themselves when faced with such obvious conflicts of interest.</span></p> <p><span>The lawsuit, which was filed April 3, charges that Texas' system violates the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of due process by giving clear legal advantages to parties and lawyers who can afford to contribute to judicial campaigns. It charges that the \"inevitable result\" of such a system is to deprive Texans of their right to have cases decided by courts impartial in fact as well as appearance. Someone has to pay for the television ads and political consultants vital to a successful race, and since judges must raise money to win their seats and to retain them, Public Citizen notes, \"no judge can break free of the appearance of being beholden to contributors.\"</span></p> <p><span>Although no one can prove that political contributions changed the decision in any given case, it hardly stretches the imagination to believe that contributions do have an effect in general; after all, campaign contributors have to believe that their money is buying results if they are to be persuaded to contribute again. Judges might favor contributors out of conscious gratitude or out of unconscious affinity for their political friends. According to a survey conducted for the state Supreme Court, 78 percent of the Texas public thinks contributions influence decisions, and 86 percent of Texas judges agree. Among Texas lawyers, 99 percent say that contributions have at least some influence on the decisions of what should be courts of law. The nine members of the state Supreme Court themselves raised $11 million in the last election. The five lawyers who joined the Public Citizen lawsuit because they were solicited for contributions understand the pressure that such influence can exert.</span></p> <p><span>The influence of contributions becomes even more pernicious given the power Texas judges have over the appointment of counsel. Unlike many states, Texas does not have a state public defender's office; instead, courts appoint individual lawyers to take the cases of defendants too poor to pay themselves. These courts have been widely accused of appointing inept, inexperienced or indifferent lawyers to the demanding task of criminal defense, a practice that is especially worrisome in capital cases where the client's life is at stake. Judges also have the power to decide how much the appointees, including campaign contributors, will be paid.</span></p> <p><span>Statistics on corruption are by nature difficult to gather. However, with a system that generates almost by design a tangled web of conflicts of interest, we should not be surprised by the legal horror stories that result. One Texas defendant was assigned as his defense lawyer a former district attorney who had once prosecuted him; furthermore, the attorney was known to have been a cocaine addict, the information having come to light after he was involved in a drug-influenced traffic accident on the way to a fundraiser for the judge who would later appoint him as defense counsel. The attorney was also $90,000 in debt to the IRS and suspected of embezzling funds from the district attorney's office; as a result of his appointment  he was eventually paid almost $90,000.</span></p> <p><span>The danger caused by improper selection of defense counsel is heightened by the reluctance of appeals courts in Texas to grant new trials to defendants whose court-appointed lawyers were incompetent. In three cases, Texas courts have upheld convictions in death penalty cases where the defense lawyer fell asleep during the trial. The trial judge ruled that the Constitution may guarantee the right to a lawyer, but it \"does not say the lawyer has to be awake\"; this judgment was affirmed, although not in so many words, by the highest criminal court in the state. Without a meaningful check on their lawyer's incompetence, poor defendants in Texas are truly thrown on the mercy of the court.</span></p> <p><span>In the midst of such impropriety (or, at the very least, the semblance thereof), where is Gov. George W. Bush, the steward of the Texas justice system? Unfortunately, Bush has not taken significant action to maintain the system's integrity.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's position on the issue is illustrated by a series of events that took place last summer. A Texas state representative had offered an exceedingly modest bill to the legislature that would have allowed counties to choose whether to continue with the current system, in which judges appointed defense lawyers, or to set up public defender's offices of their own. The bill would have also have created a county-by-county list of minimally qualified capital defense attorneys from which the judges could choose. (One index of the state of the Texas legal system is that another provision of the bill would have guaranteed suspects the right to meet with a lawyer within 20 days--almost three weeks--of their incarceration. In most areas of the U.S., the accused rarely spend 72 hours in jail before they receive a lawyer.) Both houses of the Texas legislature voted unanimously--unanimously--in the bill's favor, and the overdue reform seemed likely to become a reality.</span></p> <p><span>Before the bill reached the Governor's desk, however, Texas judges, aghast that they might lose the valuable (and perhaps profitable) ability to choose the lawyers themselves, used their full political influence to get the bill killed. As a result of the judges' lobbying efforts, many members of the legislature, including one of the bill's original co-sponsors, feigned ignorance of the bill's provisions and dropped their support for the measure. Bush agreeably followed with a veto, saying that the changes were too \"drastic\" and judges were \"better able to assess the quality of legal representation\" than county officials. He also stated that the requirement that the state release suspects who had not been assigned a lawyer after 20 days in jail \"poses a danger to public safety.\"</span></p> <p><span>Before one can \"restore honor to the White House,\" one should first restore honor and fairness to the state judiciary. The judicial system in Texas, taken as a whole, uniquely disadvantages poor defendants by depriving them of fair representation at trial, of fair chances on appeal, and of fair treatment at all levels by judges to whose campaigns they cannot afford to contribute. Yet unless a court victory forces a change in the judicial process, Texans may have to wait for public officials who have the resolve to overcome political interests and stop the sale of justice to the highest bidder.</span></p> <p><span><i>Stephen E.

{"title": "A Rising Tide of Republicans? | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>It is only fitting that the only magazine left last Sunday evening in the free magazine rack outside the Delta shuttle at Logan was the official magazine of the Republican National Committee. There were at least a dozen copies of the Winter 2000 issue, in fact, stacked up in a large pile--clearly not a big seller in the bastion of liberal thought that is our hometown.</span></p> <p><span>The magazine is titled \"Rising Tide\" (after the unofficial Republican motto: \"A Rising Tide Sinks Everything but Yachts\") and is full of quite interesting news about the Democratic candidates. Behold the articles on page 29, \"Democrats Play the Race Card While Calling People 'Cripple' and 'Fatso,'\" and page 30, \"Cabinet Secretaries Moonlight as Gore Flacks.\" And the cover story: a Gore Supreme Court lineup that's made up of Hillary and Bill Clinton, Ted Kennedy, Naomi Wolf, Al Sharpton, Barbara Streisand, James Carville, Rosie O'Donnell and Larry Flynt.</span></p> <p><span>Didn't Republicans used to be funnier? A few quotes from the candidates last week reminded me of the days of the erstwhile Presidential candidate who provided us with four years of humor back in the days when we actually elected him to public office. Of course, I am referring to former Vice President J. Danforth Quayle.</span></p> <p><span>Listen to George W. Bush, talking about his ties to California: \"I was raised in the west, the west of Texas. It's pretty close to California. In more ways than Washington, D.C., is close to Texas.\" Remember Dan Quayle: \"I love California. I grew up in Phoenix.\"</span></p> <p><span>Witness the latest gem from Al Gore '69: \"My mother always made it clear to my sister and me that women and men were equal--if not more so.\"</span></p> <p><span>And, from the New York Times: \"While visiting a class of first-graders in Ohio, Mr. Gore remained silent as the teachers and pupils spelled 'sincerely' as 'sincerly,' perhaps mindful of what happened to the last vice president to try to spell in public.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Republicans still do have a sense of humor. Especially this week--what better time for anti-government sentiment than a week in which the government comes knocking on your door to count you, ask you the status of your household plumbing, and find out what time you leave for work and how long you're gone. Of course, the results of this last question will only be used if you fail to turn in that other form this week to the IRS, in which case official government agents will break into your house and steal your stuff, in lieu of taxes. Because of the new collaboration between the Bureau of the Census and the IRS, implemented only a week ago, the IRS is now the most well-stocked agency in the federal government.

{"title": "Editorial Notebook: The Right Way to Remember Columbine | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The anniversary of the Columbine shootings has come and gone at Harvard, fortunately without any obnoxious student protest on gun laws to profane the memory of the dead. The national forum, however, was not spared the proposals of Vice President Al Gore '69 for more gun control. Gore renewed his call after the shootings in the National Zoo this Monday.</span></p> <p><span>It has become a regular pattern: Tragedy strikes, a giddy clamor for new legislation goes up and anyone who doesn't uncritically accept the hype is anachronistic, cold-hearted or--worst of all--a \"member of the NRA.\" After all, if Britain, France and Canada can achieve a near-zero incidence of gun fatalities with \"common sense\" (i.e., prohibitive) laws, why can't we?</span></p> <p><span>Most America-should-be-like-the-Continent arguments fall flat on their face, and this one is no different. More guns simply do not mean more murder, at least if you look beyond a few states in Western Europe. Israel has more guns per capita than the U.S., but its murder rate is almost half that of oft-exalted Canada. Sweden and Finland are two comparably armed societies, but you're much more likely to get knocked off in one than in the other. And Switzerland, with widespread gun ownership, is far safer than many other countries with more restrictive policies. Clearly, what works for some does not work for all. A flabby cosmopolitanism that ignores national contexts is not just intellectually lazy but morally irresponsible.</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, there is positive evidence that, at least in the United States, more guns means less crime. Whatever the sociological explanation, be it a national character rooted in the frontier experience or the distinctive American antipathy to letting government do what we can accomplish on our own, the numbers are clear. Over 20 states today permit law-abiding citizens to carry concealed handguns in public. Such laws have led unequivocally to marked decreases in crime. They have cut murder by 7.65 percent, rape by 5.2 percent, and aggravated assault by seven percent. The seminal analysis by University of Chicago researcher John Lott and others, which examined all 3,054 U.S. counties and arrived at these conclusions, has yet to be seriously undermined.</span></p> <p><span>Makes sense, if you think about it. The fashionable claims of many sociologists notwithstanding, criminal behavior is not entirely conditioned. Neither are criminals stupid or irrational. If Joey is about to jump you, he'll think twice if he knows you might be carrying a gun. Sophisticated claims to the contrary are condescending and out of touch with reality.</span></p> <p><span>What about all those alarmist claims often plastered around the Yard? Don't firearms in the household logically lead to more accidental deaths? Admittedly, guns kill a few children every year (although more drown in pools). But such statistics, in and of themselves, do not account for the amount of crime deterred and thus the number of lives saved by the presence of a gun. Lott concluded that counties without \"conceal and carry\" laws could have prevented a total of 1,414 murders, 4,177 rapes and 60,363 aggravated assaults by enacting them.</span></p> <p><span>If we are serious about preventing future Columbines, perhaps we should ask the Clinton administration to start enforcing gun laws already on the books. Buying a gun for a juvenile is a federal crime. Yet of the several thousand criminals who committed it, the Justice Department prosecuted five in 1997 and six in 1998. Bringing a gun to school is also a federal crime. Here again, though, of several thousand offenders the Justice Department prosecuted only five in 1997 and eight in 1998. All in all, a grand total of 17 federal and state laws were broken in the Columbine tragedy. Do we really believe an 18th can do anything for an administration so utterly feckless at upholding existing laws?</span></p> <p><span>The Columbine anniversary, as well as the recent tragedy the National Zoo this past Monday, should be an occasion for sober reflection. What gun policies are effective at saving human life? In America, at least, the answer is clear. The facts stare us in the face, and we have but to summon the courage to confront them honestly. The memory of the victims demands nothing less.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Gore: Bush's Tax Cut an Economic 'Illusion' | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>BOSTON--In an address to 130 core Democratic fundraisers last night, Vice President Al Gore '69 returned to his favorite line of attack against his Republican rival, George W. Bush, calling the Texas governor's tax cut an economic \"illusion.\"</span></p> <p><span>Mixing new rhetoric about Republican economic values into his standard stump speech, Gore cast his opponent's plan in extreme terms, saying Bush's tax cut would either erase the federal budget surplus or take money away from needed social programs.</span></p> <p><span>He said Americans were wise to such \"risky tax schemes,\" which Gore branded \"the politics of illusion.\"</span></p> <p><span>When Ronald Reagan proposed tax cuts and increases in defense spending in the 1980s, Gore said, \"confidence in America's stewardship and self-governance was lost.\" He said foreign investors began to look elsewhere for growth opportunities and domestic business owners could not do much to expand their businesses.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's \"two trillion dollar\" tax cut plan would similarly \"undermine confidence, instantly increase interest rates and take us back to deficit spending,\" Gore said.</span></p> <p><span>In the past, Bush advisers have accused the vice president of rewriting economic history. Though Gore back then voted against most Reagan-sponsored economic measures, many of his Democratic colleagues did not, supporting, they said, the sound fundamentals of tax cuts.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the speech adhered to Gore's normal campaign event script.</span></p> <p><span>Invoking Monday's deadly shooting at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., Gore accused Bush of pandering to the pro-gun lobby. \"What does it take?\" Gore asked to applause.</span></p> <p><span>Near the end of the speech, Gore emphasized the importance of the upcoming election to Democrats--who hope to retake the House of Representatives--and the path the Supreme Court will take in the future.</span></p> <p><span>\"The majority may determine how our Constitution is interpreted for 30 or 40 years,\" Gore said, noting the next President might appoint as many as four judges to the bench.</span></p> <p><span>Though the election season is too early for Bush to gloat about the polls, Gore trails the Texas governor nationally by about 10 points. Gore tacitly acknowledged last night he faces a fight in the months ahead.</span></p> <p><span>Though he said he would clearly win if the election were decided solely on the issues, he said that \"there's a second factor that determine the outcome of elections.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"And you can call intensity and you call it commitment and you can call it determination, you can use any word to describe it,\" he continued. \"What it comes down to is what you feel inside how hard are you willing to fight.</span></p> <p><span>The other side [is] committed, they are working hard, they're going to throw everything including the kitchen sink into this, and they've got blood in their eyes.\"</span></p> <p><span>Gore mentioned President Clinton's name only once in the 15-minute address.</span></p> <p><span>About 120 fundraisers, including Elaine Kamarck, a professor at the</span></p> <p><span>Kennedy School of Government and top Gore policy adviser, packed into a small banquet hall at the hotel.

For one thing, they've found themselves locked in a mortal struggle with a cartoon character. Then, last Tuesday, a group of Asian-law students were forced to wait for a table at Temple Bar. Now they're fighting mad and there's talk of a boycott. It looks like the <i>bushido </i>spirit is alive and well.</span></p> <p><span>(<i>Bushido</i> refers to the Japanese warrior ethic. Based on the recent public debate surrounding the portrayal of minorities in the media, it is not clear whether the use of the word is appropriate. Not all Asian-Americans are of Japanese descent. My use of the word in this context fails to appreciate the beautiful rainbow of ethnic diversity that exists under the Asian umbrella. On the other hand, bushido does invoke images of strength and combat, not math or science. Think samurai, not hairless. So, the Asian American Association (AAA) might actually be grateful.)</span></p> <p><span>Enough has already been said on the topic of the now notorious Mister Chu. The comic strip's readership has spiked from five people (the artists, their mothers and the AAA censor) to approximately 12 people, according to a recent Crimson poll.

In this age of political correctness, where would the art of ethnic lampooning be without them?</span></p> <p><span>As for the Temple Bar incident, this little brouhaha has slightly more serious implications. After all, when angry law students start throwing around the terms \"discrimination\" and \"boycott\" they must appreciate that someone's livelihood is at stake. First--because the details are pretty damn funny--some background:</span></p> <p><span>At around 9 p.m on Tuesday, April 11, 15 members of the Asian Pacific American Law Student Association (APALSA) gathered at Temple Bar to celebrate the election of their executive board. They subsequently suffered two horrific indignities. First, because the restaurant was still in the midst of its dinner rush and the hostess did not understand that APALSA group intended to order food, they were forced to wait 25 minutes to get a table. Second--and this was the straw that broke the camel's back--the group was asked to present I.D. at the door.</span></p> <p><span>Based on this criteria, I'd like to report that every bar in the Harvard Square area is rather unfriendly to Jews, and Bertucci's, where I've occasionally had to wait close to an hour, must be a bastion of anti-Semitism. Where is the Anti-Defamation League when you need them?</span></p> <p><span>After APALSA's own encounter with naked racial bigotry, the group's newly elected co-chair Shan M. Chang distributed an e-mail describing Temple Bar's disgraceful behavior. On behalf of her fellow victims she invited recipients of the e-mail to \"join us in disavowing any patronage of an institution that treats a large group of Asian Pacific Americans with suspicion and distrust.\"</span></p> <p><span>Temple Bar should take some solace in the fact that it is not the first area restaurant to be the target of reckless discrimination accusations. Several years ago the African-American community orchestrated a boycott of Grendel's Den after a waiter allegedly mistreated a black patron. The reality was that the patron was the victim of poor service, not racism, but this didn't discourage Harvard's ethnic organizations from rallying the troops and trying to put the place out of business.</span></p> <p><span>The good news is that after the initial outcry, there is some evidence to suggest the Temple Bar conflict will soon peter out. At an APALSA meeting Wednesday night that left the organization's position unclear, it seemed as if cooler heads might prevail. Still, some marginal damage has been done to the Temple Bar's reputation and that is unfortunate.</span></p> <p><span>In the meantime, concerned observers are left to wonder, \"What lies behind the itchy trigger finger of groups like APALSA? Why are Harvard students apparently so quick to cry racism?\" The obvious answer is that they have been trained to see too much of the world in terms of race. Episodes such as this most recent near-boycott are the direct outgrowth of that mindset which contends that ethnic studies is an academic discipline on par with History. They are the direct outgrowth of that mindset which obsessively counts the number of women and minorities on Faculty. And, they are the direct outgrowth of that mindset, which against all objective standards of quality, insists that Diversity and Distinction is a worthwhile read.</span></p> <p><span>At some point the outraged members of APALSA will come to realize that thankfully, for most of the world, their racial identity is not their defining characteristic. If Temple Bar did mistreat them last week it was probably not because they were Asian. More likely, the hostess saw a group of pompous Harvard Law students and decided, perhaps with a touch of malice, to keep them waiting. Who can blame her?</span></p> <p><span><i>Noah D.

{"title": "The Future of the EPA | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In a speech delivered at the Kennedy School Forum on Monday, April 17, the longest-serving administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Carol Browner described the convoluted history of federal responsibility for protecting public health through the assurance of a safe physical environment. So far, the success story has been defined by the national mediation of parochial arguments between the industrial sector and determined environmental activists, with occasional but costly lawsuits filed against the EPA by both sides. This trend will likely continue far into the term of the next EPA administrator whose style and mandate will be determined, in part, by either Al Gore '69 or Texas Gov. George W. Bush. As. Browner suggested, \"the challenge of environmental protection, like the unfailing collection of taxes, ought to transcend political party affiliations but, unfortunately, this is still a dream.\"</span></p> <p><span>Nevertheless, every opportunity should be seized to notify the two Presidential candidates, while they are still campaigning, that a fundamental redefinition of environmental issues and the rearmament of environmental stakeholders looms large on the horizon of national consciousness. The roots of the new environmentalism can be found in the recognition, at the national level, of sub-populations that are particularly vulnerable or susceptible to the impacts of environmental deterioration. Vulnerable groups, including the poorest of the poor, suffer from various combinations of natural geographical factors, insensitive zoning laws and/or uncouth sociopolitical maneuvers that increase their exposure to detrimental environmental factors.</span></p> <p><span>The increasing recognition by mainstream science that individual genetic composition, age, gender and behavioral attributes contribute greatly to human susceptibility to diseases of known environmental causes gives strength to grassroots movements to improve Federal standards and increase the stringency of regulations for the protection of the most susceptible among us. Yes, it will be expensive, and yes, industry and employers will probably fight against it. But the vision of differential vulnerability and unequal susceptibility can be erased no sooner than the unanimously accepted vision of environmental protection as a justified right of free citizens. These national issues of environmental justice and equity are sufficient to keep an EPA administrator and the President busy for two terms of office, but the increasing globalization of environmental quality and health adds an even more challenging dimension to the responsibilities of the next U.S. President.</span></p> <p><span>For starters, the Kyoto protocol on global warming is awaiting ratification. Browner made an astute observation that one of the main difficulties experienced by the Clinton administration in ratifying the Kyoto protocol is the inadequate coverage of interests represented by developing countries. If China, India, Brazil and most of Africa still consider national action plans for mitigating global warming as an unaffordable luxury in the context of a lopsided global trade and development establishment, then substantial environmental peddling remains to be done by the U.S. Unfortunately, the U.S.-sponsored Country Studies Program, the highly successful multi-agency program dedicated to assist developing countries in mitigating and adapting to global climate change is facing discontinuation as a result of budget cuts.</span></p> <p><span>In a sense these are the same local issues of variegated vulnerability and susceptibility that have now been projected into the global theater. Only here, the opposing concerns are the abortion of national economies and the likely demise of millions of poor people crammed into overpopulated coastal cities. So, it is among the vulnerable and the susceptible that the next EPA administrator must make a mark on national environmental conscientiousness and global environmental conscience. The two presidential candidates will do well now to consider carefully the credentials of their choice for the successor to Browner.</span></p> <p><span>An administrator who is as passionate about \"brown-fields\" as he or she is about \"greenhouse\" gases. An administrator who truly understands the epidemiological intricacies of individual susceptibility and group vulnerability that ultimately turned A Civil Action into a blockbuster movie. And an administrator whose commitment to public service is as boundless as the environment he or she will swear to protect.</span></p> <p><span><i>Dele Ogunseitan, Ph.D., M.P.H., is a Global Environmental Assessment Fellow at the Kennedy School of Government. </i></span></p>"}

His work in developing nations on the impoverished won him the Nobel Prize for economics in 1998.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview, Harvard President Neil L. Rudenstine said that Sen's pioneering work reflects the values the University wants to exhibit at its first commencement of the new millennium.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think what he brings will be a genuinely important and, in effect, original vision,\" he said. \"[He's known for] creating a really powerful conception with a good deal of evidence about the ways in which economic development and important freedoms and rights are interdependent.\"</span></p> <p><span>Sen, 66, has conducted research in a range of fields in economics and philosophy, including social choice theory, welfare economics, the theory of measurement, development economics and moral and political philosophy.</span></p> <p><span>Sen's colleagues praised his choice as commencement speaker.</span></p> <p><span>\"Amartya Sen is well known to everyone in the field,\" said Jeffrey Williamson, chair of the economics department. \"Even if you're living on the moon, you know who he is.

Normally, there is some jealousy or Monday-morning quarterbacking about all these awards, but there is none for Amartya. It's just a warm, soft and fuzzy feeling,\" Williamson added.</span></p> <p><span>Sen is widely recognized for his study of the 1974 Bangladesh floods.</span></p> <p><span>At a time when other economists and social scientists blamed the environment for the resulting famine and devastation, Sen's view was more subtle.</span></p> <p><span>He found that the floods themselves were not entirely to blame for the famine. Farmers whose fields were destroyed had no way to make ends meet, since their government did not find a way to employ them gainfully.</span></p> <p><span>Sen continues to challenge the prevailing assumption that food shortages are the cause for famines. His research suggests that poverty and infrastructure problems are the real culprits.</span></p> <p><span>He has also developed an index to measure poverty while taking into account the distribution of resources among poor people and the average wealth of those in poverty.</span></p> <p><span>A native of India, Sen graduated from Presidency College in Calcutta and received his bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from Trinity College.</span></p> <p><span>Before coming to Harvard in 1987, Sen taught about political economy at Oxford for 10 years. He was Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics between 1971 and 1977.</span></p> <p><span>Responding to concerns that many students will have already heard Sen speak--he spoke to undergraduates just last month and lectures regularly at the Business School--Rudenstine said, \"The number of students who haven't heard him would be larger than those who had, not to mention the parents, not to mention the alumni. I think he'll be working hard to craft something [meaningful].\"</span></p> <p><span>Several students praised the choice of Sen, saying he would add diversity to the list of commencement week speakers.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think it's really great that such an important intellectual was chosen. It's a good balance for [Class Day speaker] Conan  O' Brien,\" said Senior Class Marshal Gwen Y. Shen '00.</span></p> <p><span>She added that the senior marshals \"just spent all weekend choosing our Class Day speakers and we're very excited about our variety.

Schwartz '00 said that the response from other members of the class had also been positive.</span></p> <p><span>\"Everybody I've mentioned it to has been upbeat and that's encouraging to me,\" Schwartz said.</span></p> <p><span>Sameera Fazili '00, who is also a class marshal, said she thought Sen's address would be particularly timely.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's great that he deals with the topic of development, given the recent [World Trade Organization] protests and the calls for cancellation of third world debt,\" she said. \"It's not often that we in the United States hear from prominent South Asian intellectuals.\"</span></p> <p><span>Sen was selected by a large committee that draws up the list of honorary degree candidates and, from that list, chooses the commencement speaker.</span></p> <p><span>Rudenstine said, \"There was some effort to...try and reflect both the past and the future.

{"title": "A Capital Mistake | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Last Monday, troubled by the fact that so many people on death row in his state had been proven innocent, Illinois Gov. George Ryan issued a moratorium on executions. Though commendable, this action presupposes that capital punishment is a method we ought to use, that perhaps, if we could change the way it is administered, it would be a desirable method of crime control. However, it is not the potential for racial bias or the risk that people on death row may actually be innocent that makes capital punishment a less than ideal method of crime prevention. Nor is it the fact that we know that capital punishment is not useful as a deterrent. Rather, what states like Michigan and Massachusetts have recognized is that the death penalty is itself inherently unjust and wrong.</span></p> <p><span>The desire to seek the death penalty is a natural response to violent and serious crime, crime that cannot and should not be treated lightly. Such crime cries out for and demands punishment. Punishment, though, is only good inasmuch as it serves to preserve order and safety, redress the wrong done, and--to the extent possible--correct the offender. Only when these three conditions are met does any punishment further the common good, the most basic purpose of all punishment. When we choose the death penalty, what we are choosing is a climate of death. Such a climate is hardly beneficial to the common good, for it robs all of our lives of their sanctity and dignity. What we are doing is responding to violence with violence, saying that the only way to keep ourselves safe, to protect life, is to take it.</span></p> <p><span>When we choose to kill, we are blatantly trampling on the inherent dignity of each and every human being, a dignity found in the fact that every person is created in God's image, even the most hardened criminal. We must denounce the violent crime we see each evening on the news and read each day in the newspaper. We must, and do, sympathize with the victims of these crimes, and we must do what we can to bring about healing. But if we are to create a society in which the lives of all Americans are protected as valuable, then we cannot sanction the killing of any.</span></p> <p><span>Some people say, however, that moral considerations such as these should not be a part of our political debate. This has never been true in American politics, and never will be. When we argue about how to help the poor or how the United States ought to behave in the world, we are making ethical judgements about how we as Americans ought to act. These are indeed fundamentally moral and ethical judgements that in many cases revolve around the dignity of human life.</span></p> <p><span>We begin with our laws against murder, saying that it is wrong to take an innocent life. We believe enough in the dignity of life that we cannot allow those who are underprivileged in our society to lead degrading lives. So we have welfare and Social Security, always two important and controversial political issues. We even believe so much in the dignity of all human life that we have laws against discrimination, saying that all humans, simply because they are human beings, deserve certain rights. To say that questions of human dignity have no place in the American political scene is to deny much of what makes us American.</span></p> <p><span>We are a society that cares about and believes in the dignity of life, yet we sanction capital punishment, allowing it to become so commonplace that it ceases to become a controversial political topic. Each of the major candidates for the presidency supports retaining the death penalty and some even support broadening its use. Texas Gov. George W. Bush leads a state that executes more people each year than any other and is the leading Republican contender. Even both Democratic candidates support its use.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, few even see the necessity of debating the death penalty. Abortion, another area where we fall far short of protecting human life, is at least a hot political topic. Whether it is abortion or capital punishment, each time we condone the execution of another person, we are chipping away at the dignity of all life. It is simply not consistent for us to support the dignity of all with one hand and cut it down with the other.</span></p> <p><span>If we contend that human life is valuable, that we ought to preserve it and that people ought to be punished for taking it or maltreating it, then we cannot and must not allow our states or our federal government to employ the death penalty. We must tell all candidates for public office that, though we must punish our criminals, we cannot make our punishment into vengeance, for then we begin to destroy our laws and ourselves. We have too often seen in the far too recent past the disastrous effects of a culture that breeds violence and death. We can no longer afford to live in a society fascinated with death, watching so many Americans die every year.</span></p> <p><span>Matthew S. Vogel '01 is a sociology concentrator in Kirkland House.

{"title": "A Fresh Case of Dot-com Fever | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Human beings, by nature, are a skeptical bunch. Fads and le dernier cri (the trendy French for \"the latest trends,\" ironically) aside, we are often hesitant to accept concepts which are new and alien, especially when it comes to technology. Consider the group of Aristotelian professors who made the following pronouncement to Galileo after he claimed to have discovered Jupiter's moons using a telescope: \"[They] are invisible to the naked eye and therefore do not exist.\" Or the snappish response of Warner Brothers' founder H. M. Warner, who retorted in a 1927 interview, \"Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?\" when asked about the feasibility of films with sound.</span></p> <p><span>Prejudice against the unknown innovation has not been dulled even in this modern, \"progressive\" society of the late 20th century. Though we know Vice President Al Gore '69 always believed in the power of the Internet--after all, he created it--many others felt the web was nothing but a passing craze, a folly of sorts. When asked by the New York Times in 1988 if he thought Prodigy could entice customers to stay online, the president of one consulting firm scoffed at the notion. \"'This isn't 'Dallas,' 'Dynasty' or Dan Rather,'' he said.</span></p> <p><span>A decade later, the only member of that triumvirate still around to witness the country's seemingly overnight acceptance of the Internet as a legitimate medium was Dan Rather, and it's doubtful that even his staying power can rival that of the web. Those who originally dragged their feet are now jumping on to the information superhighway, eager to catch up (and squabbling over the few intelligible site addresses that remain).</span></p> <p><span>I have to admit that when the dot-com craze began, I too fit the mold: skeptical, skeptical, skeptical. Navigating Netscape is one thing, but programming techniques like C++ and Java make my skin crawl, much to the amusement of friends TF'ing CS50 who speak and think the language of code in the bowels of the Science Center. Steve Martin, in Father of the Bride, had my original attitude pegged exactly when he described his future son-in-law's job as an independent computer consultant: He said it was \"code for 'unemployed.'\" It just didn't seem possible that website obsession could ever become something more than hobby.</span></p> <p><span>But in the past few months, I've begun to come around. Perhaps it's the sensory overload that has resulted from continual exposure to Internet advertising of one sort or another--dot-org this and dot-net that plastered to the insides of the T, on handouts around campus or occupying three-quarters of Superbowl commercial time last month. Or maybe it's because I've been listening to the megalomaniacal plotting of various friends who anticipate what life will be like as the next Bill Gates. According to a feature in The Crimson last week, plenty of students are leaving school to work at Internet start-ups and \"not looking back.\"</span></p> <p><span>While dropping out of Harvard is not in my future, (though it certainly helped Gates), I'm beginning to see the allure of creating your own web business. Having emerged from the slime and filth of their college dorms to go from rags to riches, the computer entrepreneurs of today radiate the kind of laid-back glamour that clings to jazz musicians and stand-up comedians. In addition, they give their grandparents the bragging rights that used to be reserved for doctors and lawyers. All you need to enter this alternate dimension where the computer chips are lined with gold is a web address, some spare time and a dream.</span></p> <p><span>And the \"dream\" doesn't necessarily have to constitute something particularly sophisticated, either. Cosmopolitan ran an article last month about a DKNY publicist who launched a website that chronicles her fictional character, a trendy Manhattanite named Vivian. Supposedly, thousands of people are logging on daily to check out what \"Vivian\" is up to--you can even leave your name and e-mail address so she can contact you \"should something major be going on, or just to say hello.\" One wonders what \"major\" fictional event could possibly be important enough to manifest itself tangibly--did Vivian get an invisible run in her virtual stockings?</span></p> <p><span>But if there's a market for adults who enjoy conversing with imaginary friends, there's probably a market for just about everything. With that reassuring thought, I did some research and was delighted to find that, for a mere 35 dollars a year (payable online, of course), I can purchase my own web address and be instantly transformed into an aspiring millionaire. My lack of technical skills won't even hold me back; there are a host of web sites out there that are devoted exclusively to designing other web sites.</span></p> <p><span>So as visions of lucrative buyouts dance in my head, I am beginning to brainstorm concepts that just might launch me to cybermogul status in the years to come. With \"Dallas,\" \"Dynasty\" and even Dan Rather behind me, maybe I can make a goal of outlasting Bill Gates.</span></p> <p><span><i>Alixandra E.

What? That's right, syntax. Policy positions and leadership ability are obviously crucial to our voting decisions, but how a candidate answers a question or avoids it, the words he uses when he backs away from a former position or assumes a new one, can and should be in our minds when we go to the ballot box.</span></p> <p><span>Ralph Schoenstein, the author of \"You Can't Be Serious--Writing and Living American History\" wrote a clever piece for The Boston Globe highlighting some of the better quotes from the newly-released tape recordings of former president Richard M. Nixon during Watergate and reminding us how the more things change, the more they stay the same. Quoting one of Nixon's exchanges with White House counsel John Dean, Schoenstein points out the Clintonian ring to the president's speech. \"They'll hang us,\" Dean says. \"It depends what you mean by hang,\" Nixon replies.</span></p> <p><span>Nixon in private conversation is making a distinction between the kinds of metaphoric punishment he and his advisors would face at the conclusion of the investigation. In context, Nixon imagined something less than the complete loss of political life he was to suffer. Though my disappointment in Bill Clinton had settled in long before his famous comment that it all depends on what you mean by \"is,\" the linguistic side-step was an added blow. Its technical precision was so obviously a device to hide the half-truth behind it that Clinton insulted our intelligence while protecting his own interests. His intent was, as Texas Gov. George W. Bush might say, to \"obsfucate [sic].\"</span></p> <p><span>Though I think it is a mistake to allow Clinton's difficulties to color my impressions of Gore, who was put in the terrible position of having to stand by his boss while also maintaining political distance, I have lately found it more difficult to see the two men as separate when Gore uses a Clintonian expression in a jam.</span></p> <p><span>Last month, Gore answered in a New Hampshire debate a question about gays in the military by saying he would have a litmus test on the issue for any potential nominee to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. When the answer that had served well enough in the immediate context of the debate was perceived to be untenable for the prospective national campaign, Gore backed off from the response.</span></p> <p><span>But instead of acknowledging that he had gone too far, Gore resorted to Clinton's view that the meaning of words is created after their expression by the speaker and that the explicit dictionary meaning is to be viewed as the untrustworthy, subjective response of the listeners. He said he \"did not mean to imply that there should ever be any kind of inquiry into the personal political opinions of the officers. That is not what I meant to convey--that's what you heard.\" Whatever happened to, \"I spoke too quickly in debate. After sober reflection, I see that the answer is otherwise\"?</span></p> <p><span>Politics is a tough business, and when everyone is listening to what you say, you're bound to make more than one mistake during the course of the campaign. The Gore campaign shouldn't compound those mistakes by trying to solve them with tortured phrasing that reminds us of the worst of Clinton, not the best of the Clinton/Gore administration. I won't even address the linguistic tap-dance Bush has been performing for the last several months because it is so constant as to be almost mesmerizing.</span></p> <p><span>I write about Gore because I am concerned that he not lose support by evading difficulties with legalese (\"no controlling legal authority\") or semantic gymnastics. One of the reasons so many New Hampshire voters chose Sen. John S. McCain (R-Ariz.) last week was that they like his \"straight talk,\" that he answers questions in direct, often earthily vivid words linked in declarative sentences. Whether he means what he says and will do what he promises is a separate issue from the simple point of sounding as though he means what he says and will do what he promises. You can go a long way in a campaign if your audience doesn't flinch when you speak.</span></p> <p><span>At any level of politics, whether on campus, locally or nationally--the words our elected officials and candidates choose to use and the ways they choose to use them can reveal their natures, including the raw instinct for survival or their commitment to honest discourse. Elections are often about the energy displayed by the candidates, a sense of experience with decisions made under pressure and a perceived quality of inherent honesty. The vice president, whom I have often admired, knows this very well. It is not too late for him to embellish less, qualify less and declare more.</span></p> <p><span><i>Susannah B.

Simpson (R-Wyo.), who is also director of the Institute of Politics (IOP) and a lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School of Government, was especially fervent in his call for Republicans to forget their differences in order to take back the White House.</span></p> <p><span>\"No philosophy can be transferred or shared with your fellow citizens unless you win,\" Simpson said. \"This damn thing is about winning!\"</span></p> <p><span>Simpson faulted Republicans for permitting President Clinton to win the White House in 1992 because some split the Republican vote by supporting another presidential hopeful, Ross Perot.</span></p> <p><span>Simpson, who is advising Bush, said he believes this is the year that Republicans will learn their lesson not to apply the \"saliva test of purity\" to their candidates.</span></p> <p><span>\"They're so thirsty,\" the former senator said of his party's desire for a Republican president. \"They've been in the desert, crawling on their hands and knees.\"</span></p> <p><span>IBM Professor of Business and Government Roger B. Porter, who has advised the last three Republican presidents, agreed with Simpson's assessment.</span></p> <p><span>\"The time has come for a Republican president and a Republican Congress,\" he told the crowd, to loud applause.</span></p> <p><span>Porter's remarks followed those of Martin S. Feldstein '61, Baker professor of economics and chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Ronald Reagan. Feldstein, who is advising Bush on economic policy, spoke more about conservatism than Republicanism and expressed his clear preference for Bush over Arizona Sen. John S. McCain.</span></p> <p><span>Feldstein said he believes that Bush's tax cut proposal is more sound than McCain's, which he said only reduces marginal income tax rates at a middle income level.</span></p> <p><span>The three speakers drew a wide variety of guests, from conservative Undergraduate Council members to members of Hillel to four uniformed Reserved Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets, who carried the American flag as the Din and Tonics sang the national anthem.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's nothing wrong with ROTC,\" said Simpson in his remarks. \"It's about patriotism. Isn't that a squirrelly idea?\" he joked.</span></p> <p><span>While the conservative \"Coming Out Dinner\" in the fall was marred by protest over what some deemed misappropriation of the language of the gay rights movement, those attending last night's dinner claimed more uncontroversial motives.</span></p> <p><span>\"A lot of Republicans have deep convictions,\" said Porter, trying to explain the turn-out to the event. \"We also tend to be social people.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I don't watch what the Harvard Democrats do,\" said Jeffrey A. Letalien '00, a member of the Undergraduate Council. \"My guess is they're complacent.\"</span></p> <p><span>Simpson, however, joked about the status of conservatives at Harvard as a silent minority.</span></p> <p><span>\"I've been hanging around here for three years,\" he began his speech. \"Where have you all been?\"</span></p> <p><span>Students seemed to take the speakers' message of unity to heart.</span></p> <p><span>Robert R. Porter '02 and Mattie J. Germer '03, who head up Harvard Students for Bush and for McCain, respectively, emphasized that while they believe strongly in their candidates, they would immediately support whoever wins the Republican battle.</span></p> <p><span>Many students stressed that they have not yet decided who they will vote for. Letalien said he is leaning toward Bush but has not yet completely made up his mind.</span></p> <p><span>JCP members Lev Polinsky '99-'00 and Moshe Y. Spinowitz '01 both said they have yet to choose between Bush and McCain.</span></p> <p><span>Hannah L. Fleener '03 said she was a Bush supporter until she heard McCain speak at the IOP. Now she said she plans to vote for McCain.</span></p> <p><span>Andrew S. Robertson '03 doesn't know who he's voting for. But he said he cares more about seeing a close primary race than about preserving party unity, describing himself as \"pretty much Republican.\"</span></p> <p><span>While Robertson may not be obsessed with unity, he did pick up on a theme that ran through all three of last night's speeches, with their many references to individualism, free markets and Abraham Lincoln.</span></p> <p><span>\"Personal freedom: I'm all about it,\" he said.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Lost Art of Harvard Oratory | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>'Tis the season when smiling choruses of admissions officers, tour guides and sundry administrators begin to sing of Harvard's virtues, the foremost of which, recently, is the diversity of its students and graduates. The College, they croon, produces poets and priests, musicians and physicians, athletes and artists. But nowhere is this resplendent diversity so evident as in the difference between two of its most prominent and successful <i>alma libres</i>, Al Gore '69 and Alan L. Keyes '72.</span></p> <p><span>Of the two, Gore is more the Harvard type: a sensible and moderate, if somewhat stolid, liberal. Keyes, on the other hand, seems an unlikely product of late-1960s and early-1970s Harvard. After all, in Keyes' perfect world there are no abortions and no 16th amendment, and the wall between Church and State is a shoji screen.</span></p> <p><span>But what is most remarkable about Keyes is his ability to win converts to his extreme conservatism via exceptional spiritedness and oratorical flair; in short, his charisma.</span></p> <p><span>Nowadays, \"charisma\" has come to mean little more than \"charm\" or \"attractiveness.\" It is in this spirit that a Seattle Times reporter recently dubbed the Indigo Girls a \"charismatic duo,\" and the Minneapolis Star Tribune called Minn. Gov. Jesse Ventura \"a man so charismatic, he can insult and inspire in the same breath.\"</span></p> <p><span>Max Weber, who first developed the term, considered Jesus Christ, Joseph Smith and Martin Luther \"charismatic,\" but would surely not have extended the honor to the Indigo Girls. For Weber, followers are drawn to a charismatic leader because of his extraordinary, almost god-like, personal qualities. By virtue of his heroic personality, the charismatic leader gives rules without regard to traditional authority (\"It is written, but I say unto you\") and commands total devotion from his disciples.</span></p> <p><span>The best way to identify a charismatic leader, argues Weber, is to observe the effect he has on his followers. Keyes has had quite an influence over his. One devotee, in a letter distributed by Keyes' campaign to the \"Keyes 2000\" e-mail list, wrote that each time he saw Keyes in action he \"came away with greater conviction that God has raised him up for such a time as this. Sometimes it seemed as though Dr. Keyes was another John the Baptist...a voice crying out in the wilderness or Gideon with his army of 300...or Elijah and the thousands who had not bowed down to Baal or David going up against the strong and powerful Goliath.\"</span></p> <p><span>Charisma draws on personal magnetism--followers are drawn foremost to the leader himself, not necessarily to his ideas. For this reason, charisma is expressed more in oratory, direct communication from the leader to devoted (or potentially devoted) listeners, than in writing. Charisma itself is natural--some have a little, others a lot, no one can gain charisma through education alone--but insofar as charismatic authority depends on oratory, people can be educated to take advantage of whatever natural charisma they possess.</span></p> <p><span>At one time, oratory was central to undergraduate life. At some schools, this tradition remains: Princeton's Whig-Clio, Yale's Political Union and Oxford's famed debating societies all host regular debates on campus, and a fair number of students participate.</span></p> <p><span>Presently at Harvard, however, writing is the primary medium of political debate. At last count, there are more than twenty student publications but only one debating club. This is generally a good thing--on paper, it is considerably more difficult to hide flawed arguments amidst rhetorical flourishes.</span></p> <p><span>If Harvard produces few skilled orators these days, perhaps essayists and polemicists hardened by the demands of written debate are sufficient compensation. But the cardinal virtue of written argument--its compatibility with dispassionate, well-reasoned debate--may also be its primary shortcoming. Written debate, precisely because it favors calm discussion to fiery rhetoric, does not allow charisma much of a forum. (Keyes is infinitely more convincing in person than on paper.) Consequently, debate devoid of the energy of charismatic orators like Keyes is less enjoyable for debaters and audiences alike.</span></p> <p><span>The recent rarity of undergraduate oratory is largely due to lack of an organization to support it. Harvard has its Boylston Prize, its Parliamentary Speech and Debate Club and the occasional course on rhetoric, but no organization sponsors regular campus debates. To all but the most politically involved undergraduates, spoken debates are confined to dining halls and dorm  rooms.</span></p> <p><span>Even with the necessary support, though--say, a debating society or political union--incivility might still squelch debate. Today, most questions on which reasonable people can disagree are respectfully discussed, although casual accusations of bigotry limit debate on issues related to homosexuality or race. In the 1960s and 1970s, however, such name-calling (occasionally backed with force) silenced genuine debate on a much wider range of issues.</span></p> <p><span>As a result, men and women who studied at Harvard during that time and later became politicians--Gore, for instance--are, generally speaking, unremarkable orators, and any natural charisma remains untapped. It is odd that the same institution produced both the charismatic Keyes and the stoic Gore. But such is Harvard's wonderful diversity.</span></p> <p><span><i>Hugh P.

{"title": "Someday My Tax Cut Will Come | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The \"marriage penalty,\" as it is called, has been a favorite target of Republican ire for years. The quirk of the tax system causing some non-married couples to pay less in taxes than they would if they were married has attracted the attention of social conservatives and tax-cutters alike, providing in some cases an economic disincentive to marriage. Even the triangulating President Clinton has taken up the standard and called for an end to the marriage penalty. Unfortunately, the bill to end the marriage penalty that passed the House of Representatives Feb. 10 served more as a platform for wide-scale tax cuts than a targeted amelioration of a specific problem.</span></p> <p><span>Marketed as a Valentine's Day present to tax-obsessed lovers, the bill would close the marriage gap for those who currently suffer from it by increasing the standard deduction for two-earner households and raising the payments to married couples under the Earned Income Tax Credit, a worthy program that supports the working poor. However, the bill would also move many well-off married couples from the 28-percent to the 15-percent tax bracket, regardless of whether they were affected by the marriage penalty or not. As a result, according to the research group Citizens for Tax Justice, the plan would give almost two-thirds of its ten-year, $182 billion largess to families with incomes over $75,000 a year.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, ending the marriage penalty doesn't require a cut in taxes. At least one revenue-neutral alternative has been proposed in which married people would pay a little less and single people would pay a little more, causing the gap to disappear. Unsurprisingly, however, Congress preferred to use the opportunity for a tax cut, and rather than be left portrayed as anti-marriage, the Democrats decided to join in to the tune of $89 billion over 10 years. The Democratic alternative, rejected before the GOP bill's passage, would have called for increases in the standard deduction and the EITC, costing only half as much and giving 60 percent of its benefits to households earning less than $50,000 annually. Clinton and Texas Gov. George W. Bush have both put forward more focused plans which are even less expensive.</span></p> <p><span>Although the bill will likely face a veto by Clinton should it reach his desk, Democrats and \"compassionate conservatives\" like Bush should not hesitate to distance themselves--even in an election year--from what is clearly a sprawling tax cut. The fact that the Democratic alternative was conditioned on the development of a long-term plan to address debt reduction, Social Security and Medicare indicates that there are better uses for federal money than a large, regressive tax cut that mainly benefits the wealthiest 30 percent of married couples, many of whom are not subject to the marriage penalty in the first place. Those considering proposing to their loved ones today will just have to wait for reasonable tax relief.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Raising the Abortion Issue | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Today is National Abortion Provider's Day. It marks the anniversary of Dr. David Gunn's murder. Dr. Gunn was the first doctor killed by anti-abortion extremists, but his death has been followed by the deaths of six others. The attempted murders, bombings and threats have been too numerous to number. Today, however, it is not enough to mark the graves of those who have fallen defending a woman's right to choose. Because we are in the middle of a presidential race we have the opportunity to make abortion safe and accessible again, or face the consequences of losing the right to reproductive freedom 28 years after Roe v. Wade.</span></p> <p><span>Abortion is not a pretty issue. Candidates shy away from it, voters often don't have a definitive stance on it and the Supreme Court in recent years has been waffling on it. The debate is dominated by extremists and the early momentum against extremist attacks has petered out in the last decade. Since 1977 there have been almost 2,400 reported incidents of violence against abortion providers.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the extreme importance of this issue to men and women across the nation, little has been said about it in the presidential debates. But the next President of the United States will have the fate of legal abortion in his hands. With the expected appointment of 3 justices during the next president's tenure in office, the delicate 5-4 balance in favor of abortion rights could shift dramatically. And while women today are more informed about birth control and will soon have access to RU-486, abortion is still one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in the country.</span></p> <p><span>The recent debates about so-called \"partial-birth\" abortions symbolize the loose-cannon and irresponsible rhetoric which have been used by anti-abortionists. These late-term abortions, rarely performed and then often only to save a woman's life or prevent severe health risks, have become the picture of an abortion procedure in many American's minds thanks to vivid, if not technically accurate, descriptions of the procedure. Such gross-out tactics do not help to inform a debate upon which women's lives, livelihoods and freedoms depend. The avoidance-shuffle that candidates have been performing around the issue has allowed anti-abortionists to slowly chip away at women's reproductive freedoms unnoticed by the mainstream public.</span></p> <p><span>The disproportionate clout that these anti-abortionist groups have over candidates is symptomatic of another important issue--campaign finance reform. But what is more essential for today's abortion debate than the banning of soft-money is the clarification of the issue by candidates and representatives.</span></p> <p><span>The fact that Democrats and Republicans have yet to debate face-to-face means that candidates have been able to choose which issues to address. Gore must resist the urge to ignore the abortion issue in the coming months. He should more clearly highlight the ways in which insidious and downright evil practices by anti-abortion extremists--such as killing providers and attacks on family members and clinics--have blocked women's right to abortion in practice if not in theory. Other less violent by equally damaging measures, such as arbitrary parental consent laws, must also be struck down. Gore must vocalize the measures he would take in order to stop these infringements.</span></p> <p><span>Second, the stakes are high in this election. Many voters, swayed by Bush's compassionate conservatism and McCain's anti-establishment identity, may convince themselves that because neither candidate says he will impose an anti-abortion litmus test, it is not more than likely that anti-abortion justices will be appointed to the Supreme Court. Many voters just don't realize just how slim the majority defending their right to choose is at the present time.</span></p> <p><span>Students must recognize that this is an issue of primary concern to them as well. America's teen pregnancy rate is one of the highest among developed nations. In fact, because students today have grown up without knowing what a pre-Roe world looked like, many take for granted that abortion is an option available to them. However, if students don't act soon, they may find themselves back in that world in a few years.</span></p> <p><span>Most Americans don't like to think about abortion. A candidate who spends too much time talking about it runs the risk of losing touch with voters who associate abortion with grisly details. Voters may instinctively vote for the candidate who seems to be able to erase abortion from the American consciousness altogether simply by erasing it from his campaign speeches. But in the words of that sixties folk song, \"you don't know what you've got till its gone,\" voters may wake up one day to realize that abortions, far from being banished from the American vocabulary, are being performed in back alleys. Like our mothers and fathers, they will know someone who died from an illegal abortion. It will be much harder to ignore abortion then.</span></p> <p><span><i>Meredith B.

{"title": "Dartboards | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><b>Battle of the Booze</b></span></p> <p><span>While Harvard's Undergraduate Council members go about their business quietly, their peers at University of Massachusetts-Amherst have been battling for beer. They have been trying to change a college rule that prohibits students over 21 from having more than 24 cans of beer in their rooms at any given time. They want to expand the limit to 30 cans. This impetus for this drive has been the launch of larger cases of beer which would not conform to university regulations. The administration toyed with the idea, but several days ago decided to maintain the original limit of 24. They argued that allowing students to have more beer in their room would promote drunkenness--rather like combating obesity by setting a cap on the number of Twinkies and other sundry Hostess snack cakes that one can own.</span></p> <p><span>This rule raises a remarkable and baffling array of questions and problems. How does one exactly enforce the limit? Do wandering proctors and administrators periodically stop by dorms, notebook in hand, poking around for cans and bottles? Perhaps a team of forensic experts who can determine whether the slew empty cans on the floor are evidence of recent infractions or a casual approach to cleaning?</span></p> <p><span>Moreover, having beer cans as the standard unit for measurement raises an array of problems. The student government must work to develop a system of conversion where other spirituous liquors are pegged to cans of beer, just like currency exchange rates. A bottle of red wine would equal however many cans of beer, a bottle of port somewhat more and a bottle of bourbon would equal quite a few. University officials could carry the exchange rates on a convenient laminated card and rapidly work out whether a room owning a half bottle of amontillado, a third of a liter of brandy and jug of moonshine had broken the laws.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps like representatives manipulating the tax code to benefit sorghum growers and bauxite mines, administrators could hope to shape students taste with favorable exchange rates for quality products. A couple of changes to the fine print and U-Mass Amherst students will soon be known throughout the Commonwealth for their subtle and sophisticated taste in drinks.</span></p> <p><span>--Charles C. DeSimone</span></p> <p><span><b>Aqua-Man Combats Campaign Doldrums </b></span></p> <p><span>The national media wasted precious inches this week in its endless, dry and rather pointless coverage of the Super Tuesday primary elections. Blinded by its incomprehensible quest to champion the story with the fewest number of interesting angles, it overlooked a veritable news gem which broke early Monday morning at the California Yacht Club in Los Angeles. Instead of reading about how Al \"the Bore\" Gore and George W. \"I-went-to-Yale-so-I-stink\" Bush were probably going to capture  instead their respective party nominations (duh), we should have found the famous French adventurer Remy Bricka adorning the front pages.</span></p> <p><span>Who, you may ask, is Remy Bricka? The pretentious thing would be to make the reader feel intellectually inadequate for not recognizing such an important pop culture icon. But since the writer herself had never heard of the man before she was assigned the story, we'll pity the reader somewhat. Quite simply put, Remy Bricka is a man who can walk on water--literally.</span></p> <p><span>In fact, Bricka might just be the world's expert on water walking. He accomplishes the feat by balancing himself with a double-sided paddle on a pair of cance-like skis--and for overnight trips, he uses as his \"rest stop\" the catamaran that he drags behind him and which is stocked with supplies. In 1988, Bricka walked 3,502 miles across the Atlantic Ocean from the Canary Islands to Trinidad--a stunt which landed him in the Guinness Book of World Records for longest distance walked across water (though one has to wonder what kind of competition he was really getting in that category).</span></p> <p><span>And this Monday morning, as hundreds of frazzled journalists followed hundreds of frazzled campaign staffers and their equally frazzled (though hiding it quite well) candidates from bake sale to support group to school at a hundred different press conferences with equally bad lighting and equally stilted speeches, Bricka set off--unfettered by the petty questions of politics--into the wide blue yonder. He plans to walk the Pacific Ocean to Sydney, a trip which will take him across 7,800 miles in six months, provided he struggles forward at an average of 14 hours a day. One oceanographer was quoted in the New York Times as saying: \"People are lost at sea every year because of this foolishness--this guy sounds like an excellent candidate.\"</span></p> <p><span>Foolishness? Perhaps. Well, definitely. But disregarding the danger of death by strange sea animals, high winds, dehydration, etc., it might just seem tempting to some of these politicians and their entourages. But, seeing as we're not as dumb as Bricka, we won't hold our breath waiting.</span></p> <p><span>--Alixandra E. Smith</span></p> <p><span><b>Checking Back With the Joneses </b></span></p> <p><span>Texas Gov. George W. Bush's speech at Bob Jones University has come to be held as a symbol of intolerance and bigotry that his opponents can wield against him at will. Prior to New Hampshire, Dubya had tried to remain moderate, but his loss forced him to veer to the right in order to shore up his nomination. Rather than lean to the far right, Dubya chose more of an all out sprint. This tendency of the Republican Party to force its candidates to move to the right during the primaries has been its method of choice in recent elections for political suicide in the general election.</span></p> <p><span>At the time of Dubya's appearance at Bob Jones University, the school had a ban on interracial dating and an anti-Catholic reputation. The decision of a candidate who wants to campaign on inclusion and compassionate conservatism to make an appearance at such a university said more about his position on tolerance than any debate. The press rightfully slammed him for the speech and this was supposed to hound him well into the general election.</span></p> <p><span>And then Bob Jones III, president of Bob Jones University, declared on Larry King Live that the school had dropped its ban on interracial dating. Before Dubya starts raising more money, now that he has solidified the nomination, he needs to send some of his pricey spin doctors out to draw attention to this change in policy.</span></p> <p><span>This change has serious ramifications for how we deal with intolerance. Rather than deride it and put a blanket over it, perhaps what we really ought to do is bring into the light and draw attention to it. Whether or not Dubya deserves credit for this change is debatable considering he did not express any regret about the policy during his speech. Nevertheless, he had no right to campaign as an environmentalist or as advocate for breast cancer research. If Dubya is going to insist on spending obscene amounts of money on his campaign, the funds should at least go towards something he almost has the right to take credit for.</span></p> <p><span>--Benjamin M.

He added that Gore has his \"full support\" and that now is the \"time for unity\" to win the White House.</span></p> <p><span>Bradley said his campaign failed because unions and the Democratic party establishment supported Gore and because he failed to communicate that his candidacy was not one of \"self interest.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"It certainly shows that when you do battle with entrenched power that it's very difficult and, indeed, I think that's what the story of the campaign was,\" Bradley said.</span></p> <p><span>While Bradley said he would not run as a vice presidential nominee with Gore, aides say he could run for the presidency again in 2004 or 2008.</span></p> <p><span>About an hour after Bradley's announcement, McCain announced from his retreat in Sedona, Ariz. that he was suspending his campaign.</span></p> <p><span>\"I am no longer an active candidate for my party's nomination,\" McCain said. \"A majority of Republican voters made clear that their preference for president is Governor Bush...I respect their decision.\"</span></p> <p><span>He said he would continue to work for reforms on Social Security, Medicare and his signature issue, campaign finance reform.</span></p> <p><span>\"I will take our crusade back to the U.S. Senate,\" McCain said, adding that he wants to reform \"a tax code that benefits the powerful few at the expense of many.\"</span></p> <p><span>McCain thanked the many Republican, Democratic and independent voters who supported him during the course of his campaign and urged them to stay active in the political process.</span></p> <p><span>\"Our crusade will never achieve all of its goals if your voices fall silent in the national debate,\" McCain said.</span></p> <p><span>One of every four GOP primary participants in this year's elections had never before voted in a Republican contest.</span></p> <p><span>\"He energized a lot of voters and a lot of people who wouldn't have voted,\" said Thomas R.

{"title": "Gore Rides Bradley's Presidential Waves | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>What was the significance of Bill Bradley's run, and what does his pullout mean for the Democratic Party and the general election? Bradley ran to the left of Al Gore '69, appealing to the more traditional Democratic Party constituencies. Centering his platform around liberal themes, like universal health care and an activist approach to race relations, Bradley hoped to galvanize support amongst Democrats and independents to unseat Washington-establishment candidate Gore.</span></p> <p><span>And for a while, it worked. Although Bradley was not considerably more exciting or attractive, many of his ideas resonated with Democratic voters, and his authenticity seemed a far cry from the forced smiles and awkward Macarena dances of the creator of the Internet. By November, Bradley was on par with Gore in New Hampshire, and the media had criticized the Vice president's lack of campaign focus.</span></p> <p><span>The tide soon turned, however, and three factors helped Gore smother Bradley: Money, media and the machine. Gore's ad campaign exposed Bradley's conservative Senate voting record and contested his position on nearly every major issue. The media effectively ignored Bradley during the heat of primary season because of firebrand John McCain--who also took a chunk of the independent vote with him. And the continual whoosh of endorsements in every state from elected officials--from town crier to state senator--made Gore seem invincible. Especially because Gore has been running since 1996, it was only natural that he had built a list of eager endorsers--especially when it could mean political favors in a Gore presidency.</span></p> <p><span>Which brings us to political reality. In a primary where the handpicked successor of a popular two-term president was the front-runner, Bill Bradley had to show how different he was--personally and politically. The only way he could do that was by running to the left of the Vice president. But by doing so, he removed himself from the main-stream and eliminated his chances of winning the general election--which is ultimately what Democratic voters, just like Republican voters, want to see.</span></p> <p><span>As Clinton's 1992 and 1996 elections show, the death of liberalism--at the national level--is imminent. Although Gore temporarily appeased liberal support groups--especially the AFL-CIO, which provided him with the key endorsement--he will have to ditch ideas about eliminating the internal combustion engine if he wants to win in November, and continue the pragmatic \"third-way\" sought by his predecessor.</span></p> <p><span><i>--Vasant M.

Bush and the subsequent demise of the insurgent candidates, McCain and Bradley.</span></p> <p><span>However, Tuesday was also \"super\" because ESPN \"Sportscenter\" anchor Stuart Scott came to Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Scott, who is widely known for his catch phrases and colorful personality as one of ESPN's most dynamic and informative analysts, came to Harvard to speak to Sam Fulwood's Institute of Politics study group, \"Race, Media and Politics.\" He was gracious enough to spend some time candidly discussing his life, his work and his ambitions.</span></p> <p><span><b>The Harvard Crimson: </b>As a host of ESPN's \"Sportscenter,\" you're known for your unique style and inventive vocabulary. Some of my favorite sayings include \"He's gotta be buttah, 'cause he's on a roll,\" \"Mojo! BIG Mojo!\" and the ubiquitous \"Boo-yah!\" What is your favorite catch phrase?</span></p> <p><span><b>Stuart Scott: </b>I don't think I have a personal favorite. My favorite thing I've ever said on the air, as far as catch phrases goes, involves my daughter. I have two daughters, one who is four months and one who is five years old. When my five-year-old was two, she would say \"Daddy, can I have another one candy\" when she would want some more candy. So, my favorite catch phrase--if someone hit two home runs in a game--I would say \"another one home run, Daddy.\" It's my favorite because it involves my daughter, and it's nice when I can get her on TV.</span></p> <p><span><b>THC: </b>As many have observed, you tell sports stories with the language of urban America. What sort of feedback have you received, and do you think your current fame is a validation of the way you tell sports stories?</span></p> <p><span><b>SS: </b>I never felt like I needed to be validated. I knew that as long as I worked hard, wrote well, did my own research, busted my hump to look up facts and figures, no one could make me feel like I shouldn't be doing what it is I'm doing. Not that people haven't tried, but I don't validate myself based on what other people think. I don't do this because I try to be someone else.</span></p> <p><span>What you see from everybody who does \"Sportscenter\" is some extension of their personality. The way I talk on TV is not the way I talk all the time. But off-camera, it is the way I talk a lot of the time. I feel there are times when it is appropriate to fall into a more comfortable usage of slang. If I'm hanging with my fellas or if we were sitting watching a game, drinking a beer, and Shaq starts doing what he did the other day--scoring 61 points [against the Clippers]--I'd say, \"Shaq is killing them kids \u2026 he is just housing them. Come on man, come on Shaq, don't hurt 'em.\" That's part of who I am. That's part of the music I listen to.</span></p> <p><span><b>THC: </b>Would you say remaining true to yourself and embracing your off-camera personality is a necessary aspect of your job on TV?</span></p> <p><span><b>SS: </b>Definitely. Anyone who is successful at this job has to do that. Chris Berman on-camera is the same guys he is off-camera. Bob Costas on-camera is the same guy he is off-camera. But I'm not going to get on TV and be Bob Costas because that's not who I am. I think Bob Costas is one of the best in this business, but I'm not going to get on TV and act like Bob to try to be good because that is not my personality. In the same way, Bob can't get on NBC and start talking about somebody trying to playa-hate somebody because that's not who he is. I'm just down-to-earth in real life and that is what comes across on-camera.</span></p> <p><span><b>THC: </b>You grew up in Chicago and North Carolina and went to college at UNC. You must have been buffeted by sports as a child and a young adult. What are your fondest sports memories from your childhood and what do you view as defining sports moments of your youth?</span></p> <p><span><b>SS: </b>I have a few. I really remember my first baseball game. I was about five years old and my dad and his brother, my Uncle John, took me and my brother to a White Sox double-header against the Oakland A's. Vida Blue pitched the first game for the A's. I remember my dad and Uncle John talking about the A's trading Vida Blue to the White Sox in between games and that he would pitch the second game for the White Sox. I thought \"Alright, it's going to be cool for the White Sox to get a black pitcher,\" and I couldn't wait to get to my seat and wait for Vida Blue. Of course they were kidding, but I really remember looking forward to Vida Blue.</span></p> <p><span>Another memory I have--and I don't even know if you know this--was when the Super Bowl Champions played the College All-Stars. I was at the last game at Soldier Field in 1976. My grandfather took me and my brother and my two cousins. It rained so hard they cancelled the game. I had never seen a football game cancelled because of rain. I remember sprinting back to the car--the four kids and my granddad--and my granddad took a spill in the parking lot.</span></p> <p><span>And, of course, I remember sitting around the TV with my brother and cousins the night of April 8th, 1974, when Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's record. Those are the things I remember that happened. I also grew up playing sports, but if you ask about sports things I did, then we'd be here for two hours (laughing) 'cause I was All-World, All-Everything\u2026.</span></p> <p><span><b>THC: </b>That sounds interesting, but I don't want to keep you that long. Anyway, aside from being All-Everything in sports at UNC, you were also a good sports reporter for the local radio station. Being a sportswriter myself, I was wondering if you had any advice for current sports reporters on how to succeed and continue doing with what we love.</span></p> <p><span><b>SS: </b>You have to learn how to deal with \"No.\" A lot. You'll hear more people tell you \"No,\" you'll be turned down for more jobs, you might hear people insult you. A news director in college reduced me to tears on the phone because he told me I sucked and I would never make it in this business. A professor told me I wouldn't make it because I was too silly. If that's too much for you to handle, then choose something else.</span></p> <p><span>If you know you want to do it and you can handle all of that, then go for it. This isn't to pat myself on the back because I think it applies to a lot of the people I work with, but I would not trade the years of shooting my own tape, editing my own tape and being the only person at night working on highlight clips for anything.</span></p> <p><span>Also, always write your own stuff. Even at the level I'm at, it's not about the cameras, the makeup, the attention or the popularity. This job is all about writing, plain and simple. Can you write well? Creatively? Can you tell me a story in a short time to make me go \"Wow, I didn't know that\"? Can you find that information that no one else knows? My favorite thing I've ever said on \"Sportscenter\"...was when Homer Bush, who was playing for the Yankees at the time, hit a home run two years ago. I put together a list of the ten people named Homer to have played in the major leagues and reported that only three of them had ever hit homers...</span></p> <p><span>I'll give you \"Boo-yah!\" and \"Don't hate the playa, hate the game,\" but I will also give you more stats and information than anyone else who sits in that \"Sportscenter\" chair. I guarantee you that. In my mind, if I can continue to do that then I can say whatever is off-the-wall and crazy because I'm backing it up. I think this emphasis on stats and information and doing our own writing is what makes \"Sportscenter\" better than FOX and CNNSI. You will learn more watching \"Sportscenter\" than any other highlight show....</span></p> <p><span><b>THC: </b>To shift to a lighter topic, we've seen you in rap videos and other media. What are the chances we can expect a feature film starring Stuart Scott in the near future?</span></p> <p><span><b>SS: </b>I'd love it. I haven't been featured yet, but my voice was in \"He Got Game\" and I just did some work for Bruce Willis' upcoming film \"The Kid.\" I've also done an episode of \"The Hughley's\" and \"Arli$$.\" The problem is that I always play myself. I want to play somebody else.</span></p> <p><span><b>THC: </b>The new \"Shaft\" film is coming out soon. Would something of that caliber interest you?</span></p> <p><span><b>SS: </b>Yeah. Well, Sam [Jackson] is a buddy of mine. He's playing Shaft in the film. I was actually playing golf a couple weeks ago with him and Richard Roundtree, who is playing Shaft's father.</span></p> <p><span><b>THC: </b>If starring roles start coming your way, would you leave Sportscenter or do you see yourself staying on for twenty years like Berman?</span></p> <p><span><b>SS: </b>I'm not one of those guys who says, \"In five years, I want to be here or there.\" I don't do that. What I want to continue to do is diversify myself. I want to do a lot of different things. It would be nice if I could do \"Sportscenter\" and a little of this and that. That would be my ideal situation.</span></p>"}

McCain acknowledged yesterday that the candidate and his staff made serious strategic mistakes in the weeks prior to the primaries on Super Tuesday.</span></p> <p><span>Dan Schnur, who served as communications director for McCain's operation, said that when the organization \"acted like a conventional campaign,\" it fostered an atmosphere which destroyed McCain's quixotic bid for the presidency.</span></p> <p><span>Schnur spoke yesterday at the Kennedy School of Government in an informal luncheon co-sponsored by the Institute of Politics and the Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy.</span></p> <p><span>\"We made three major mistakes, and a million little ones,\" Schnur told a crowd of more than 50 students, faculty and staff.</span></p> <p><span>The first major mistake, he said, was a series of television advertisements comparing Texas Gov. George W. Bush to President Clinton, which aired in South Carolina prior to the state's</span></p> <p><span>Feb. 19 primary.</span></p> <p><span>In the advertisement, McCain addressed voters about his Republican opponent, saying,  \"his ads twist the truth like Clinton.

Jerry Falwell and the Rev.Pat Robertson.</span></p> <p><span>In a speech delivered in Robertson's hometown of Virginia Beach just a day before the Virginia primaries, McCain called Falwell and Robertson \"agents of intolerance,\"  saying that he hoped the Republican Party would not follow their lead.</span></p> <p><span>The statements were construed by many voters to be an attack on evangelical Christians, rather than just Robertson and Falwell, Schnur said.</span></p> <p><span>\"It was too nuanced of a message [for the day before the primary],\" Schnur added.</span></p> <p><span>Summing up the campaign, he said most of the mistakes were made as McCain's message gathered momentum.</span></p> <p><span>\"For ten months, we ran as near a perfect campaign as we could have...but in seven days, we melted down,\" Shnur said.</span></p> <p><span>Schnur also took time yesterday to explain why he believes McCain appealed to voters.</span></p> <p><span>He said that during the time when every candidate--Democratic and Republican--was trying to paint him or herself as the \"Anti-Clinton,\" McCain \"believed himself not only opposite of the incumbent president, but to the entire system of which the President is just a representative.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"[He was] the anti-everyone,\" Schnur said of McCain.  \"But I never was behind it until it actually started to happen.\"</span></p> <p><span>Schnur emphasized that it was when McCain departed from this ideology--when he became \"just another politician\" --that the campaign was irrevocably damaged.</span></p> <p><span>\"All the other times we were writing a new set of rules for politics,\" Shnur said. \"When we lapsed into a conventional campaign...that's what cost him the nomination.\"</span></p>"}
{"title": "Courting the Irish Vote | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Here in Massachusetts, the voters of St. Augustine's Cemetery in South Boston can make or break an election. Stories about these voters, legends in the history of Boston politics since the days of Mayor James Michael Curley, are staples of Irish-American political lore. Such tales are brought up every year at South Boston's annual St. Patrick's Day breakfast, where Boston pols get together at the local union hall, eat corned beef and cabbage and roast each other in an equal-opportunity political slugfest.</span></p> <p><span>The dearly departed Democrats of St. Augustine's, however, have unfortunately been a bit out of touch with current events as of late. Rumor has it that they've been busy rolling over ever since Tom Menino was elected mayor of Boston. The upcoming presidential election has them in a bit over their heads (about six feet). For whom might these souls arise to vote come November?</span></p> <p><span>The need to court the Irish-American vote has not escaped those running for office this year. Vice President Al Gore '69 and Texas Gov. George W. Bush have reportedly been planning their St. Patrick's Day advertising blitzes for weeks. Here's what such an exchange might have sounded like:</span></p> <p><span>It all started several weeks ago, when Gore issued a press release detailing his plans for celebrating the holiday: \"I cosponsored the bill that made corned beef and cabbage a St. Patrick's day feast,\" said Gore's statement. \"I'm responsible for the beginning of this rich tradition.\"</span></p> <p><span>Not to be outdone, the Bush campaign issued the following reply from the governor of Texas: \"The Prime Minister of Ireland is Bertie Ahern. And I didn't even have to look that up. So there.\"</span></p> <p><span>Warning shots fired, the press release war began to heat up. Al Gore shot off a notice trumpeting the endorsement of Ted Kennedy, and anointing himself the bearer of the passed torch. Said Bush in response: \"I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was\u2026oh, never mind.\" The Gore campaign has repeatedly denied responsibility for the appearance of signs reading \"Whitey says vote for Al,\" a reference to Whitey Bulger, the South Boston fugitive on the FBI's most wanted list.</span></p> <p><span>Ever since the Bob Jones University debacle, Bush advisers have been nervous about the Catholic vote. Bush saw an opportunity, though, to make up for his past mistakes. This year, St. Patrick's Day falls on a Friday during Lent, when Catholics are not allowed to eat meat. The traditional corned beef and cabbage dinner was in jeopardy. Upon hearing that the archdioceses of Boston and Fall River have given special dispensation to their parishioners to partake in the day's feast, Bush pledged to secure a papal blessing for all American Catholics to eat their corned beef this Friday. The Pope was unavailable for comment on this proposal. In response, Al Gore had this to say: \"Though I am not Catholic, as a United States Senator I played a critical role in establishing the Lenten dietary guidelines of the church.\"</span></p> <p><span>This sort of exchange was bound to go negative. Leaked footage of a proposed Bush campaign ad, obtained from a secret source, shows the first round of attack. Every year, in a peculiar tradition, the city of Chicago dyes its river bright green in commemoration of St. Patrick's Day. The text of Bush's ad, superimposed on footage of this event, proclaimed, \"A great Chicago tradition. But under a Gore administration, the federal bureaucrats would ruin the fun in the name of the 'environment.' Vote Bush in November.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Gore campaign had obviously found out about the attack ad, and prepared an attack of their own, with the same footage. Their text: \"Green rivers. Every day.  Just like Texas. Vote Bush.\"</span></p> <p><span>Despite this recently uncovered dash for Irish support, the voters of St. Augustine's seem unfazed by the activity. (Come to think of it, they seem unfazed by any activity.) Current polls are running two to one in favor of Gore, whose legendary stiffness makes him the hometown favorite. Results from polls in districts with similar demographics (there are several in Chicago) are still being tallied; analysis will be done by the Bureau of the Census.</span></p> <p><span>Until the counting is done, however, the best barometer of the state of the Irish-American political landscape is still the annual South Boston St. Patrick's Day Breakfast, hosted by the state senator from South Boston since its beginnings in 1957. (According to the Gore campaign, the breakfast tradition began when the then 8-year-old Al Gore mentioned the idea while on a family vacation in Massachusetts.) Though the pols officially get the day off because of the obscure Massachusetts holiday, Evacuation Day, that commemorates the day the British left Boston, it's St. Patrick who gets all the press. That's because candidates, national and local alike, recognize the importance of the Irish vote--from cradle to grave.</span></p> <p><span><i>Noelle Eckley '00 is an environmental science and public policy concentrator in Dunster House.

{"title": "The Spectre of Reform | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>After an abrupt end to the competitive primary season, the two candidates who have received their parties' nominations--Vice President Al Gore '69 and Texas Gov. George W. Bush--have made long-overdue pledges to make campaign finance reform significant parts of their platforms. To some extent, the moves were political maneuvers to win over independents who supported Arizona Sen. John S. McCain and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. Nevertheless, we are heartened that although the presidential bids of McCain and Bradley have ended, the spectre of reform will haunt the candidates as they move towards the general election.</span></p> <p><span>Granted, hearing Gore and Bush talk about campaign finance is a bit like hearing Microsoft extol the virtues of antitrust law. Gore's campaign has been hounded by a Justice Department investigation for 1996 fundraising practices. Recently, Maria Hsia, a Democratic fund-raiser, was indicted for her role in the now-infamous Buddhist Temple incident. Meanwhile, Bush's campaign gained notoriety for the millions it raised from wealthy donors. Bush's recent campaign finance proposal would allow still candidates to fundraise from these very same donors, and Bush's large tax breaks for higher-income Americans would ensure that these donors don't hesitate. Moreover, both Democrats and Republicans have benefited from enormous inflows of \"soft money,\" contributions to political parties that are currently unregulated by federal election laws.</span></p> <p><span>But these facts do not preclude the possibility of reform. Gore has openly apologized for his past actions, and has even offered to limit soft money donations if his opponent will. Such bilateral actions are necessary because it would be unreasonable to expect either candidate to take a self-imposed handicap in the general election. We urge Bush to act on Gore's offer, particularly because Bush's financial might puts the Texas governor in a unique position to initiate reform. If the self-described \"reformer with results\" is to make good on his claim, he will need to be the first to limit his own soft money contributions.</span></p> <p><span>Neither of the candidates seem naturally inclined towards reform. But we hope that the spirit of reform, like Banquo's ghost, will hound them throughout the campaign. Such pressure will serve Americans well by ensuring that the fight to get special interests out of politics will not end with the losses of McCain and Bradley.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Bitter to the End | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Why does Arizona Sen. John S. McCain bear the Republican candidate George W. Bush such animosity? What kind of man is Bush? Can there be any doubt that he is a cokehead? However, asking this question needlessly complicates the issue, which is that Bush is of course a presidential candidate with grand aspirations. Aspirations to what, you may ask? To becoming the president and appointing lots of people to make important decisions about stuff that needs to be done. What kind of stuff? Ask him, not me. I'm sure he knows some of what he wants to do, and can probably look up the rest.</span></p> <p><span>McCain braved the forces of his party leadership to defeat this anointed candidate, pledging to reform the political system if given the chance. I found his platform compelling for this reason alone, but his strategy of appealing to Democrats to win the Republican nomination seems tactically myopic, or at the very least, deserving of some other conjoined big words. And he lost.</span></p> <p><span>Rather than pull out of the race like most defeated politicians would, though, McCain has only suspended his campaign until Bush presides at the GOP father-son picnic of a convention. The only reasons he must have for doing so are personal, not issue-based. After all, Bush is a Republican and thus more likely to advance the Republican platform than McCain. Granted, the two platforms are reasonably similar, with the only difference that the Democratic tilts slightly towards the impractical and disorganized left while the Republican tilts slightly towards the mean-spirited and bigoted right. Of course, the Internet throws a wrench into everyone's political calculus.  No wait, it doesn't. My bad.</span></p> <p><span>Still, McCain and Bush bear no love for each other, save for that love each of them holds in a cosmic sense for humanity in general. But just for a moment, assume that love for humanity is not motivating either of the candidates and come with me on a thought experiment into the relationship between these two enemies.</span></p> <p><span>What exactly did Bush do to McCain to engender such bitterness? Attack ads? Everyone uses attack ads. Unfair spin? Politics always has been dirty, and no politicians can take these things personally without exploding. Sure, Bush ran a dirty campaign, but at the risk of sounding subjective, what else do you expect from a spoiled, dumb, rich, arrogant, sneering frat boy? Not that he'd be a bad president, so long as his advisors keep him from doing and/or touching anything.</span></p> <p><span>So maybe Bush did something else to McCain. Perhaps he just kept on bothering him in his bus, making prank phone calls asking him where he could buy a ticket for the Straight Talk Express and then hanging up mischievously. Bush probably also kept on signing McCain up with different long distance companies, and maybe also invited him to really good movies he knew McCain wanted to see even though he knew McCain was campaigning that weekend. Frankly, I don't really know. Maybe they made plans to play laser tag but Bush cancelled at the last minute. At any rate, McCain feels enough animosity not to enthusiastically endorse the Republican candidate.</span></p> <p><span>That such a die-hard Republican refuses to endorse the Republican candidate is almost as strange as legions of Democratic activists supporting someone only marginally less anti-abortion than a Christian Coalition bumper sticker. So what is it really that McCain and his eclectic supporters dislike so much about Bush?</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps it is not so much divergent stances on issues that divide them as conceptions of power. McCain feels that power should derive from principles, Bush from tradition and money. McCain wants to see disenfranchised voices brought back into the political fold, Bush wants to be elected. McCain wants to realign the Republican party along less provincial and more democratic lines, Bush wants to cut taxes. These differences, more than any one issue, have both energized liberals to support McCain and energized McCain to hate Bush. It will be interesting to see if McCain--like a defeated Reagan in 1976--can achieve his ultimate goal of moving politics in general (but more specifically the Republican party) away from its clubby and exclusive structure, or whether this very structure, personified by the grey and plodding personality of Bush, will overwhelm his popular calls for reform.</span></p> <p><span><i>Matthew M.

{"title": "Rising Oil Prices Bittersweet | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The recent increase in gas prices has exposed the unsettling dependence of the U.S. economy on cheap petroleum. Although many have called for drastic actions to reduce prices, the U.S. should not fight too hard to maintain its low gas prices forever. In the long run, prices that more accurately reflected the social costs of oil would be both an economic and an environmental benefit. For now, however, there is good reason to smooth the transition and to lobby oil-producing nations for increased production.</span></p> <p><span>The price of oil has almost tripled over the last 14 months, from $11 to $30 a barrel, mainly due to supply constraints imposed by the cartel of Oil Producing and Exporting Countries (OPEC). The costs of heating oil and gasoline in the U.S. are rising substantially, with gas prices expected to reach $1.80 or even $2 a gallon by the summer. Although the price rise is smaller than those of the 1970s, some worry that the increases will fuel inflation--or convince Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to raise interest rates--and choke off the economy's growth.</span></p> <p><span>In one sense, an increase in gasoline prices is overdue. Among industrialized nations, America has abnormally low prices for gasoline, mainly because of lower gasoline taxes. These low prices do not reflect the full costs to society of gasoline use, which include air pollution, contributions to global climate change and dependence on foreign oil producers.</span></p> <p><span>President Clinton is right to use this unusual opportunity for public discussion of energy policy to raise such long-term concerns, reiterating his proposals for tax credits for alternative fuels and energy efficiency. The potential risks of extreme weather events due to climate change make it prudent to reduce carbon dioxide emissions as an insurance policy against more dramatic changes. No matter what technique the U.S. eventually uses to reduce emissions, the price of gasoline to the consumer will have to increase.</span></p> <p><span>This is not to say that we should celebrate the current price rise. Prices are high in most European nations because of gas taxes, not supply constraints, and these taxes send revenue to the governments rather than OPEC--revenue that can be used to build public transportation systems, fund alternative fuels research, mitigate environmental damage or compensate the poorer citizens and gas-dependent industries disproportionately affected by the tax.</span></p> <p><span>However, we should not expect the U.S. economy to make a transition to higher gas prices instantaneously. For the short term, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is planning to visit OPEC nations before their March 27 conference, and the U.S. should not hesitate to pressure the cartel to restore normal levels of production.</span></p> <p><span>As for domestic initiatives, Clinton's proposal to create a heating-oil reserve in the Northeast would be more reasonable than selling oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for general consumption, although the latter may be necessary at some point if prices continue to increase. Congress should approve Clinton's proposal as well as resist Texas Gov. George W. Bush's hasty proposal to repeal a 4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax, which would take away valuable highway funds while at the same time passing savings on to oil producers rather than consumers.</span></p> <p><span>The U.S. should take reasonable steps to moderate the price increase for the moment. For the long term, however, Americans should get used to the idea that a gallon of gasoline might not always be cheaper than a gallon of milk.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Demagogue Deserved Rebuke | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Many Harvard students were disturbed that the Institute of Politics (IOP) invited Pat Buchanan because of his history as a hate-mongering demagogue. Although Buchanan sometimes also advocates legitimate positions, he must be ostracized because of the danger his racist rhetoric poses to our society.</span></p> <p><span>The response to Buchanan (excluding the one or two questions implying that Buchanan is a bigot simply because his views differ from most Kennedy School students) was neither inappropriate nor restricted to liberals trying to silence a conservative speaking at Harvard. Buchanan must be vigorously confronted with his long record of racism at his every appearance to stop him from turning the hateful rhetoric on and off to suit his purposes. Confronting hate-mongers is not the sole province of the left, accepted wisdom in Cambridge notwithstanding. Buchanan's bigotry is not a figment in the imagination of liberals: His anti-Semitic ranting has been denounced by leading conservatives like William Buckley and Norman Podhoretz.</span></p> <p><span>One cannot separate the messenger from the message. There is a duty to oppose racists, even if one agrees with many of their legitimate policy positions because of the danger they pose to our society. It is important to expose bigots instead of accepting them into the mainstream by focusing on their respectable advocacy. Giving demagogues a platform to speak about legitimate issues also enhances their ability to spread hate.</span></p> <p><span>Sadly, Buchanan has not been relegated to the oblivion of the fringe, as demonstrated by the IOP's recent invitation, an honor it would not have extended to a David Duke. Harvard students therefore had a responsibility to demonstrate that they do not consider Buchanan an acceptable part of the political spectrum. Although Buchanan has usually been more circumspect in his incitement than the likes of Duke, his history as a demagogue is just as long and unambiguous. Buchanan has repeatedly used the rhetoric of patriotism and conservatism to spread the cause of bigotry. For example, Buchanan's opposition to the Gulf War was perfectly legitimate, if not puzzling for a supporter of a hard-line American foreign policy for so long. But his rhetoric--insinuating that American Jews blindly loyal to Israel were the main proponents of a war to be fought by an American military composed entirely of non-Jews--constituted nothing less than demagogic anti-Semitic incitement.</span></p> <p><span>As Charles Krauthammer (not exactly a flaming liberal himself) wrote, \"[Buchanan's] technique is to convey raw prejudice to his followers, who understand his code, than go on respectable media [and now to Harvard], smile and pretend he never meant it. His trademark is the wink. The wink is interpreted by his friends in mainstream media as 'I'm fooling the mob.' It is understood by the mob as 'I'm fooling the pointy-heads.'\"</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, even Buchanan's legendary oratorical skills (admittedly superior to that of his questioners) could not completely hide his dark side at the ARCO Forum on Thursday. Buchanan stood squarely behind his remarks in praise of Hitler, his crack that Holocaust survivors have \"group fantasies of martyrdom\" and his support of Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk. As Neal Sher, the former director of the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations said, \"Buchanan went to bat for every Nazi war criminal in America.\"</span></p> <p><span>The response by Harvard students could not have been an attempt to divert attention from Buchanan's conservative message because his address was devoid of conservative issues. Whatever its merits, campaign finance reform, with adherents and detractors amongst both left and right, is not a conservative cause. Buchanan's new alliance with Marxist and extremist of the left, Lenora Fullani, who accompanied him to the ARCO Forum, is not a sign of moderation but rather of the completion of his metamorphism into prejudice-preaching populist. The only thing missing was his usual demagogic attachment of Jewish-sounding names to the Washington and Wall Street establishments that he now says are ruining America.</span></p> <p><span>I am not suggesting that Buchanan does not have the right to articulate his views, even the racist ones, only that the IOP should not have given him a soapbox. Once it did, the proper response--conservative or liberal--to the appearance of this Nazi sympathizer at Harvard was to question the invitation by confronting him with the hate-filled rhetoric Buchanan saves for audiences he thinks receptive to bigotry.</span></p> <p><span>Buchanan wrote that, \"George Bush should have told the NAACP convention that black America has grown up, that the NAACP should close up shop, that its members should go home and reflect on JFK's admonition: 'Ask not what your country can do for you, but rather ask what you can do for your country.'\"</span></p> <p><span>It is ironic that the Institute of Politics, dedicated to the remembrance of President Kennedy, saw fit to invite Pat Buchanan, a demagogic hate-monger who casts aspersions on the patriotism of whole groups of Americans, sometimes through the very words of Kennedy's most inspiring address.</span></p> <p><span><i>Aharon J.

{"title": "When You Go to The Polls | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Trying to find substantive differences between the two candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore '69, is not easy. Democratic voters heading to the polls in New Hampshire next Tuesday and across the country in the coming months have a choice between two tall, balding, politically moderate, Ivy-educated white men. The two had essentially identical voting records in their time in the Senate together, and their positions on the vast majority of issues are indistinguishable. Both support abortion rights; both are environmentalists; both support free trade. Both support campaign finance reform and gun control. And, in line with the post-Bill Clinton orthodoxy of the \"new\" Democratic Party, both support the death penalty and oppose gay marriage.</span></p> <p><span>Given their similarities, it is little surprise the Democratic race to this point has been so heavily dominated by discussion of the two candidates' image and \"electability.\" But this is unfortunate. On two of the most important issues facing the nation in the coming years--health care and education--Bradley and Gore have put forward substantially different proposals. We are confident that between the two, Bradley is the right choice for the Democratic nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Currently, about one in six Americans, including 11 million children, have no health insurance. Bradley's bold $65 billion health care plan would ensure near-universal and affordable coverage. Low- and middle-income families would enjoy subsidized premiums and all families would see a tax break for premiums. Bradley would expand Medicare, adding benefits for non-routine prescription drugs and increasing housing and transportation aid to the elderly.</span></p> <p><span>Bradley's \"leave-it-to-individual-communities\" approach to public education would allow each school to use federal dollars in the way they saw most efficient and useful. As a senator, he has voted in favor of voucher programs on an experimental basis. Although the merits of vouchers are still inconclusive, Bradley has displayed a willingness to try out new ways of improving our public schools. In addition, recognizing the implications of our current teacher shortage, Bradley has vowed to forgive student loans for 60,000 college students, high-school graduates and mid-career professionals who certify as teachers and commit to serving in poor urban or rural schools.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond health care and education, Bradley has also put forward a bold and intelligent proposal on gun control, calling for mandatory licenses for handgun buyers and supporting a ban on \"Saturday night specials.\"</span></p> <p><span>To voters, Bradley is best known for his outspokenness on campaign finance reform. Certainly, this is refreshing, particularly in an era where political campaigns can be dominated by unlimited inflows of \"soft money\"--about $250 million in 1996. Bradley would ban soft money to national parties and prohibit state party committees from spending their soft money to influence federal elections. Additionally, Bradley has vowed to increase taxpayer financing of elections and require all broadcasters to give candidates free time. Such moves would help to make federal elections more about ideas and less about money, reinvigorating our currently impoverished level political discourse.</span></p> <p><span>That is not to say we are entirely comfortable with the former senator. Many of the positions he shares with Gore--his support for the death penalty, his opposition to gay marriage--disappoint us. But his refusal to follow all other candidates, Democratic and Republican, in supporting the Kansas State Board of Education's decision to teach creationism is encouraging, as is his unique refusal to discuss his private religious faith publicly. On balance we feel that he is the best candidate for the Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>In the Republican primary, we choose former Arizona senator John S. McCain without reservation. While we naturally disagree with many of his conservative social positions, he is hands down the most impressive candidate that the GOP has fielded in the past ten years.</span></p> <p><span>McCain's frank attitude and independent perspective have won our affections. No Republican has presented a more sensible tax cut plan, small enough to avoid pushing the government into future deficits. No Republican has presented a more sensible approach to reforming the military. No Republican has been more willing to speak out against the party's corporate benefactors in the tobacco industry. No other candidate--of either party--has had the audacity to go to Iowa and rightly speak out against ethanol subsidies.</span></p> <p><span>McCain's commitment to salvaging the political process form the pernicious influence of monied special interests has been inspiring. For years he has fought the good fight in the Senate, working with Democrats and alienating the leadership of his own party. His commitment to the common good, even at the expense of his own political fortunes, is extraordinarily refreshing.</span></p> <p><span>In the post-Clinton era, how nice it would be to see a national leader emerge of McCain's evident integrity. While he faces an enormous obstacle in the form of George W. Bush, intellectual light-weight and financial Mighty Mouse, we hope that McCain can somehow overcome. The Republican voters of New Hampshire can do the nation a great service by casting their votes for McCain, keeping his candidacy and his message alive for at least another round.</span></p> <p><span>If there is any way to insure that future presidential elections will offer the American people greater hope for their future, it is through serious campaign finance reform. We hope that a victory for Bradley and McCain will keep this issue in the spotlight.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>A Democratic Alternative </b><p> </p><p></p></font>While Bradley positions himself as a leftist alternative for Democratic primary voters, Gore's proposals and his record after seven years in office speak for themselves. Bradley's liberal rhetoric has captivated the national media but won't hold up against Republican opposition and independent skepticism. Gore's more pragmatic approach and his deftness as a political leader make him a better choice for Democrats.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>After his boss tried to reform health care in 1993, Gore learned the lesson that an expensive, ill-defined plan is less appealing than a practical, targeted one. Gore's sensible proposal for health insurance would focus on covering children and working families, two groups with the greatest need for immediate action. Bradley wants to take another crack at universal health coverage, a laudable principle without a prayer of passing Congress. He counts on market forces to make up the difference for the poor while scrapping the safety net of Medicaid. Gore's cheaper, more incremental approach makes political sense. Democrats shouldn't make the same mistake twice.</span></p> <p><span>The vice president's record on issues of importance to black voters also stands out for praise. Bradley should be commended for making racial unity a centerpiece of his campaign. But actions speak louder than words: The Clinton-Gore administration has repeatedly stepped out to defend affirmative action from assaults by Republicans. Bradley's views may have been shaped by his black teammates on the New York Knicks, but not enough for him to lead the fight for major civil rights legislation while he was a senator, apparently. No wonder Gore's support among black voters seems unshakable.</span></p> <p><span>Both Democratic candidates have their strengths, but Gore, one of the most influential vice presidents in history, has demonstrated a better track record on core Democratic issues. He deserves his party's nomination.</span></p> <p><span><i>--Adam A. Sofen '01 </i></span></p>"}

Alan L. Keyes '72 finished fourth, with 6 percent of the vote. Gary Bauer, the former Reagan policy aide, barely topped one percent to place fifth.</span></p> <p><span>Exit polls show that McCain's large margin of victory can be attributed to a record turnout of independent voters--41 percent of those voting Republican considered themselves independent.</span></p> <p><span>According to exit polls, a third of Republicans thought Bush lacked the ''knowledge to serve effectively as president.'' Three fourths of those voters picked McCain, with the remaining votes split between Forbes and Keyes.</span></p> <p><span>Only 7 percent of voters considered themselves evangelical Christians.</span></p> <p><span>Though there are fewer Democrats in the state than Republicans, Gore supporters credited a huge turnout for their victory.</span></p> <p><span>They credited his turnaround in the polls over the past month to a less rigid campaign style which de-emphasized Gore's Washington roots.</span></p> <p><span>\"Al really needed to change his campaign, and he did,\" said Sen.

Batty '02.  \"Big money always gets beaten by big ideas.\"</span></p> <p><span>New Hampshire has a history of endorsing outsider candidates; in 1996, Patrick J. Buchanan narrowly defeated Bob Dole in the state, though Dole went on to win the Republican nomination.</span></p> <p><span>In his concession speech, Bush credited his opponent for a well-oiled campaign, but played down the importance of McCain's victory.</span></p> <p><span>\"New Hampshire has long been known as a bump in the road for front-runners, and this year will be no exception,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>The candidates stumping for votes were squabbling over a relatively paltry pie--New Hampshire's primary decided only 29 of the more than 2000 delegates required for the democratic nomination and only 17 delegates for the Republican nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, candidates are hoping that early victories will either solidify their early leads in the polls, or legitimize their campaign in the case of challengers like Bradley and McCain.</span></p> <p><span><i>--With reporting from Garrett M.

People were hunkering in bomb shelters, stocking up on canned food and cleaning out gun shops, but for what? When Jan. 1, 2000 rolled around, there wasn't much destruction as a result of the dreaded Y2K computer bug. A few minor glitches popped up here and there, like people in New York and Nebraska being charged over $90,000 for turning in rented videos late or the New York Times' automated phone system telling people that it was the Jan. 3, 1900 issue of the paper. Ironically, the homepage of the self-proclaimed \"inventor of the Internet\" Al Gore '69 displayed the date as Jan. 1, 19100.</span></p> <p><span>Although the predictions that the world would end were about as accurate as Dionne Warwick's Psychic Friends Network, the precautionary efforts undertaken by companies and governments worldwide ensured that we can safely ring in the new year, the last year of the second millennium.</span></p> <p><span>The United States alone spent $100 billion to remedy the Y2K problem, some of which was used to promote readiness in other parts of the world. The Pentagon's efforts to ensure safety in the Russian nuclear arsenal were especially welcome. The efforts of the government and the private sector resulted in massive overhauls and scrutiny of existing computer systems to guarantee that the year 2000 would not wreak havoc upon the world.</span></p> <p><span>This money was not only insurance against Armageddon; it had secondary benefits for the companies and individuals involved in the effort. First, many companies' outdated computer systems were updated, enabling them to meet consumers' needs faster and more efficiently. Furthermore, the experience of finding dangers hidden in seemingly innocuous software has forced companies to examine their software for other bugs and regard their systems in a more critical light.</span></p> <p><span>More importantly, we are finally seeing how the hard work and hype truly averted a serious problem. Now, Y2K-related errors are popping up in some more important computer systems. The Y2K consulting firm the Gartner Group reported that some of its clients had problems ranging from a computer that mixed up customer orders to a dentist's office that would not allow appointments to be made for the year 2000 and then crashed, destroying patients' records.</span></p> <p><span>More seriously, kidney dialysis machines manufactured by the Swedish company Gambros would not run a necessary cleaning cycle in the year 2000. These bugs are just small hints about what could have happened if the world did not jump on this problem. Computer experts predict more errors to arise as the month progresses, but thanks to early intervention most critical government systems and major companies will be running business as usual.</span></p> <p><span>While many now decry the media hype and billions of dollars spent on the Y2K bug when no major consequences have occurred, the early efforts were what prevented serious problems from occuring. We must remember that the precautions taken by government and industry enable us to sit here and complacently take everything for granted. So while the wood stoves slowly trickle back to the shelves of Home Depot and Sears, be thankful that you don't have to eat Vienna Sausages for dinner tonight.</span></p> <p><span><b>DISSENT: Too Much Money, Too Late </b></span></p> <p><span>U.S. actions regarding the Y2K crisis can hardly be seen as early or admirable. The U.S. did not fully address or acknowledge the problem until the latter part of the '90s--a good 20 years after the issue was first brought to light. As early as 1971, our nation's own official committee on data protocols was calling for a four-digit date standard in computers, rather than the two-digit standard that was commonplace at the time. To have tackled the problem then would have killed any Y2K worries forever.</span></p> <p><span>However, such prescience was not to be. And so the world spent an estimated $600 billion to squash the bug that our great nation unleashed through its own programming ineptitude.</span></p> <p><span>For those who like to keep count, that's $600 billion too much, too late. So why are we calling these efforts \"precautions\" when the problem was known to have existed long ago? Why are we lauding our government for spending even more money just to make sure its very own weaponry wouldn't accidentally launch? Why are we proud of the fact that many firms and even government institutions exposed themselves to security risks in their frantic race against the clock to fix the bug?</span></p> <p><span>We shouldn't be patting our backs because we narrowly averted disaster; we should be screaming at ourselves for getting so close in the first place. Developed countries such as Italy spent far less than the U.S., and they did just fine. An Italian newspaper printed the apt headline, \"The Bug Was a Dud; the Great Fear is Over; But Some Accuse: It Was a Bluff to Make Money.\"</span></p> <p><span>If we truly believe that all of the money was well spent, and that action was taken quickly and efficiently, then perhaps we have a Y2K bug of our own. It's called gullibility.</span></p> <p><span><i>--Robin S. Lee '03 </i></span></p>"}

Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56 Wednesday, less than a month before the first state primary of the campaign in New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span>Flanked by the candidate himself, along with Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino and a host of local and state officials at a Dorchester middle school, Kennedy praised Gore's commitment to working families, education and health care.</span></p> <p><span>\"I relish the opportunity to give my full-hearted and complete endorsement to my great friend, a magnificent vice president, and the next president of the United States, Al Gore,\" Kennedy said.</span></p> <p><span>Echoing a theme of Gore's campaign, that he has been a more committed Democratic soldier than maverick opponent Bill Bradley, Kennedy said Gore has all the right credentials to receive his support.</span></p> <p><span>\"No one in this country has fought harder and been more effective for the principles of the Democratic Party than Al Gore,\" Kennedy said.</span></p> <p><span>In the course of the five-minute endorsement speech, the liberal senator said Gore would be the \"education president,\" the \"strong economy president\" and the \"health care president.\"</span></p> <p><span>Health care has long been an area of interest for Kennedy. He is currently a leading co-sponsor of national \"patient's bill of rights legislation,\" and for years has championed federal efforts to provide health coverage for poor Americans.</span></p> <p><span>In recent days, the Gore campaign has attacked Bradley's health reform proposals, saying they give the wealthy loopholes to deduct their insurance, while replacing the federal Medicare program that insures the poor with less-reliable vouchers for care.</span></p> <p><span>Bradley has denied the charge, arguing that his proposal would increase the number of Americans with insurance coverage.</span></p> <p><span>Bradley told reporters late Wednesday that Kennedy's endorsement would have no effect on voters. \"All I have are the people,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>A Bradley campaign spokesperson said the endorsement reflected Gore's support among the Democratic establishment.</span></p> <p><span>\"It didn't come much of a surprise,\" he said.</span></p> <p><span>\"We're definitely up against entrenched power,\" responded Mo Elleithee, Bradley's New Hampshire press officer. Elleithee said he thinks the voters of New Hampshire are too independent to \"base their decision on the endorsement game.\"</span></p> <p><span>But a certain segment of the state's population--particularly the middle-class voters who commute to Massachusetts from southeastern New Hampshire suburbs--may find Kennedy's endorsement an incentive to support Gore, said Constantine J. Spiliotes, dean of the Rockefeller Center for Public Policy at Dartmouth College.</span></p> <p><span>\"Increasingly, a lot of New Hampshire residents are transplanted residents from Massachusetts, so it'll have more of an impact than it would have 20 years ago,\" Spiliotes said.</span></p> <p><span>Though he is a fellow Harvard graduate and a party elder, Kennedy's endorsement of Gore was not always a sure bet. Kennedy's positions on the issues, particularly on health insurance coverage and poverty, are more in line with the views Bradley has promoted.</span></p> <p><span>Also, Kennedy has criticized the Clinton administration's welfare reform efforts. In a December forum with Boston Globe editors, Kennedy hinted that he had not yet made up his mind who to endorse. But Gore's campaign and Democratic Party officials aggressively lobbied the senator to endorse the vice president before the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary.</span></p> <p><span>The Globe reported Tuesday that the campaign and the Massachusetts senator's staff held negotiations on just how to make the endorsement effective.  Kennedy has endorsed the party's favored candidate before, including an enthusiastic nod for Michael Dukakis' presidential bid in 1988. He endorsed Clinton in 1992 and 1996.</span></p> <p><span>Later Wednesday, Kennedy campaigned with Gore in Portsmouth, N.H. a few hours before the candidate engaged in his fourth debate of the primary season with Bradley just a short hop away in Manchester.</span></p> <p><span>That debate focused on health care, and the candidates traded barbs on whose plan would insure more Americans.</span></p> <p><span>Gore mentioned Kennedy's endorsement in the context of promoting his plan.</span></p> <p><span>Bradley and Gore will also debate in Des Moines, Iowa this Sunday.</span></p> <p><span>Their final debate before the Feb. 1 primary is on Jan 26.

The Republicans have more at stake in attracting young volunteers, campaign officials said.</span></p> <p><span>The Forbes campaign regularly pays for busloads of transplanted Massachusetts students to canvas the state. At most of the debates and town hall forums, Forbes' young voters are the most visible--resplendent in orange vests, moshing to heavy metal music. It all seems decidedly un-Forbesian.</span></p> <p><span>Keith Appell, a Forbes campaign aide, insists that the candidate's message is responsible for the visible outpouring of support, not the plush mega-bus and free jackets.</span></p> <p><span>\"Steve's message encompasses all types of people,\" Appell said. \"He's the only candidate talking about the future.\"</span></p> <p><span>Still, the volunteers themselves seem shy about admitting to the nobler purpose. After a December debate in Manchester, one youthful Forbes supporter with spiked hair avowed, \"I'm here for the free ride.\"</span></p> <p><span>In the next few weeks, Forbes's campaign will pay for volunteers to distribute literature on doorsteps across the state.</span></p> <p><span>Forbes is currently running third in the New Hampshire polls, just ahead of Alan L. Keyes '72, and a bit behind McCain. For the so-called \"third-tier candidates,\" the next few weeks are make-or-break. Poor showings in New Hampshire will likely narrow the Republican field.</span></p> <p><span>Several of these campaigns are focusing on young voters to help mobilize other voters.</span></p> <p><span>The challenge that Keyes and others face was evident Sunday night, at a gala dinner for the state's top fundraisers and volunteers. All six Republican candidates--George W. Bush, Gary L. Bauer, McCain, Forbes, Keyes and Orrin Hatch--were given 10 minutes to speak.</span></p> <p><span>Forbes went first, giving a slightly modified version of his standard stump speech. Then came McCain, who tried to make news by lambasting Sen. Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore '69 for their views on the gays in the military policy. After George W. Bush finished speaking, his handlers made a strategic decision. They decided to leave, right then and there, for the campaign hotel, about 25 minutes away in Manchester.</span></p> <p><span>The result: 50 members of Bush's traveling press corps--about half of the assembled press--trudged up the stairways while Keyes began to talk about America's \"moral obligation.\"</span></p> <p><span>Keyes aides acknowledged the problem.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's hard to avoid their tunnel-vision,\" said William Webber, Keyes's New Hampshire state chair.</span></p> <p><span>The campaign will try to grab the attention of state voters with its first television ad campaign. At Sunday's event, campaign staffers set up a camera behind a table of youthful Keyes supporters. They turned on a Klieg light when their candidate stepped to the podium. At the same moment, the Keyes supporters stood up, waved their large signs, and cheered loudly, creating the effect of an audience-wide accolade.</span></p> <p><span>Later in the evening, the campaign set up the camera outside the door to the stadium, soliciting \"spontaneous\" commentary of the event from young-looking Republicans who passed by.</span></p> <p><span>Webber said that young Keyes supporters will help distribute more than 50,000 pamphlets in the weeks ahead. Many of the supporters are recruits from small area colleges, where Keyes always proves a big draw.</span></p> <p><span>The Bush campaign will do much of the same--but in grander style. They're renting an airline hangar and filling it with cots, hoping to lure young volunteers up to New Hampshire in the final days of the primary.</span></p> <p><span>\"We have got a big youth organization,\" said Mindy Tucker, Bush's press secretary.</span></p> <p><span>Things are a bit less complicated for the Democrats in the state. Though the latest statewide polls give Bradley a five point margin of victory, a likely Gore win in the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 24 will bring him up in the polls come the first of February, political analysts believe. With the exception of fringe candidates like Lyndon H. LaRouche, Bradley and Gore are directly competing.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>The Harvard Push </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Harvard Republicans who support Bush will spend the next two weekends in the state going from door to door. About a dozen have volunteered to spend their entire intersession with the campaign.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Harvard's McCain supporters have similar events planned--and will participate in a \"community service day\" on Jan. 22, when they'll all volunteer at local soup kitchens and senior citizens homes.</span></p> <p><span>Campus Democrats also plan to stay busy, though more than 100 have already traveled up North.</span></p> <p><span>Students supporting Al Gore will join comedian Al S. Franken '73 and actor Sean Penn in knocking on doors during intersession.</span></p> <p><span>According to Luke P. McLoughlin '00, who organizes Harvard's Bradley supporters, about 20 students will spend the intersession in New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span>Those students will spend 18-hour days working phone banks, visiting prospective voters, and helping to drive members of Bradley's press corps.</span></p> <p><span>Will all these efforts pay off? Most residents tell pollsters they are very well-informed about the state of the campaign. A lot have already made up their minds, some tepidly.</span></p> <p><span>Mike Connally, 24, said he is a reluctant backer of Bush. He said he won't vote for other, more conservative candidates like Gary Bauer because \"they can't win.\" And he certainly won't support McCain because \"he's too liberal.\"</span></p> <p><span>Bill Kerrigan, an independent who has voted for Democrats in the past, said he, too, has decided to vote for Bush. \"I like his track record in Texas,\" he said. In New Hampshire, registered independents can vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary.</span></p> <p><span>There is some solace for New Hampshire voters seeking excitement, for their tiny state basks in the national spotlight as the primary approaches.</span></p> <p><span>New Hampshire feels \"a sense of controlled chaos,\" said Jonathan C.

{"title": "A Welcome Halt to Executions | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In a welcome but somewhat belated act of conscience, Illinois Gov. George Ryan announced a moratorium Jan. 31 on executions in his state. Illinois has been ground zero for the death penalty battle: over the past 13 years, 13 prisoners have been released from death row on the grounds of their innocence, more than have been executed during the same period. Although Ryan had consistently defended the death penalty until now, another exoneration last month and a scathing review of the justice system by the Chicago Tribune apparently convinced him to change his mind. In a statement that we should expect our political leaders to echo, Ryan said, \"Until I can be sure that everyone sentenced to death in Illinois is truly guilty, until I can be sure with moral certainty that no innocent man or woman is facing a lethal injection, no one will meet that fate.\"</span></p> <p><span>Ryan has been lamentably slow to recognize the death penalty's failings. One death row inmate, Anthony Porter, came within two days of his execution. When Porter was released based on evidence uncovered by a Northwestern University professor and his journalism students, the governor's spokesperson said that \"the system worked.\" But the facts were too strong for Ryan to ignore: according to the Tribune series, almost half of all capital convictions or sentences were overturned on appeal for trial errors, 46 death row inmates had been convicted on jailhouse-informant testimony and 33 inmates had been represented by an attorney who was at one point disbarred or suspended. On Jan. 31, a spokesperson for the governor said that \"It's clear that the system is broken.\"</span></p> <p><span>The move demonstrates how even the most ardent advocates of the death penalty can recognize the danger of wrongful convictions and act to prevent them. No one favors the death penalty for innocent people. Hopefully Illinois' action will have consequences nationwide; one especially hopes that Gov. George W. Bush's Texas, which executes more people than any other state, and Gov. Jeb Bush's Florida, which has identified more innocent death row inmates than more than any other state, will follow suit. Ryan's example shows that a politician, even one who has defended the death penalty, can still have the courage to govern by principle.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Cold Feet on Global Warming | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>Even though the New Hampshire primary has officially kicked off the 2000 presidential campaign, it is not surprising that a recent Kennedy School of Government poll found that Americans, by and large, are uninterested in this presidential season. One reason is that times are good and the candidates are nibbling at the edges.</span></p> <p><span>On the GOP side, the same old mantra of taxes, taxes, taxes seems to be the leading song choice. This would seem odd now, given the obscene prosperity that has been generated over the past half decade. Not that taxes don't make for great political fodder. It is just that at a time when people are doing well and America is preeminent in the world both economically and militarily, a government-bashing tax cut doesn't seem like the most sellable line. Equally important, to be sure, is the important issue of health care. Democrats are right to seek out the high ground on it (or at least the stable ground on it). But in reality, health care is only a wedge of a much bigger policy pie.</span></p> <p><span>Candidates are sidestepping thorny topics in their search for their parties' nominations. The focus of the debate has remained too narrow, and our nation will reap the bitter dividend from this. Some crucial issues will go unexamined and unconsidered until well after we have made our collective choice.</span></p> <p><span>One topic all these candidates are avoiding, but should address before they retire from this year's national political brawl, is the environment. We should not be reassured by the recent cold snap that has gripped the whole northeast; we are still facing large disruptions in the climate. Larger, that is, than the tornado that ripped apart Oklahoma City, the hurricane that created over $1 billion in damage in North Carolina or the $4 billion in damage caused all across northern Europe by freak windstorms last December.</span></p> <p><span>All of this, and what's still to come is the byproduct of global warming, a phenomenon by which the burning of fossil fuels traps solar heat within the earth's atmosphere, changing global weather patterns. If this theory is correct, then the basic equilibrium that has maintained the earth's natural heating and cooling system for the past 10,000 years is about to be thrown into turmoil. We will be left to try to fix it.</span></p> <p><span>Candidates need to speak up. If they're reluctant, then they ought to be asked. Vice President Al Gore '69 has been strangely silent on this topic. Not that he bears the sole blame; he has had only one challenger and that challenger is losing ground fast. Gore has no desire to expend valuable political energy on this issue. After all, the environment is a hot-button topic that polarizes party radicals on both sides of the fence.</span></p> <p><span>But Gore needs to say something. The American people have shown a broad bipartisan concern for the environment. Texas Gov. George W. Bush was governor when Dallas won the dubious honor of being named the smog capital of America. Bush may have a worthy response to this accusation, but under our current money-guided politics, we'll never know. Nobody is moving this issue to the front-and-center.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, whoever steps into the White House as our nation's next CEO is going to have to grapple with the consequences of our worsening environmental condition. So will all presidents throughout this upcoming century. Avoiding it won't make the problem go away, it will only help it get worse.</span></p> <p><span>When four inches of snow in Boston in January is a national news story, something is wrong.

A third said they were moderate and only a sixth, self-identified themselves conservative.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever has changed at Harvard, it is still far more liberal than the U.S. population at large.</span></p> <p><span>But there are signs that Harvard sometimes eschew the liberal ideology for practical concerns.</span></p> <p><span>There is substantial disagreement about issues that were once liberal mainstays--almost a third of students polled supported banning race-based affirmative action, far more than the number of students who described themselves as conservative. Less than half support race-based preferences. Only 43 percent of students polled agreed that the death penalty should be banned.</span></p> <p><span>Yet these particular issues, say scholars of politics and civic life, have always been among the least tightly held tenets of liberalism--and do not indicate an aversion to progressive principles.</span></p> <p><span>\"Misgivings about racial preferences extend beyond conservatives,\" says Ramesh A. Ponnuru, a senior editor at the National Review, a conservative opinion magazine. He cited recent initiatives to curtail affirmative action in California and Washington that have received support among Democrats.</span></p> <p><span>Overall, while Harvard students may not be as liberal as they once were, students remain staunch supporters of much of the liberal rubric.</span></p> <p><span>As a student body, we are confident in government's ability to affect change in society--only 21 percent of students polled disagree that government is an effective body for solving social problems, and students overwhelmingly disagree with the notion that big government is a threat to our country's future.</span></p> <p><span>In contrast, national politicians of every ilk have recently distanced themselves from ideas of expansive government with broad social mandates.</span></p> <p><span>\"There's a reason that Bill Clinton felt it necessary to say 'the era of big government is over,'\" Ponnuru says.</span></p> <p><span>Students overwhelmingly support raising spending for education, but barely reach a consensus to raise taxes on the rich--a full 29 percent oppose taxing the rich and another 24 percent have mixed opinions on the issue.</span></p> <p><span>While there are intimations of political moderation on Harvard's campus, Harvard students, for better or for worse, remain well to the left of the general population.</span></p> <p><span>Winthrop Professor of History Stephan Thernstrom says Harvard students are far more accepting of homosexuality than the American public. Eighty percent of students polled agreed that gays should be allowed to marry. Thernstrom says only 11 percent of the Americans feel the same way.</span></p> <p><span>In contrast, students strongly support bringing ROTC back to campus.

Hoover and Alfred M. Landon over Franklin D. Roosevelt '04  in the 1932 and 1936 presidential elections, respectively, even though Roosevelt, the architect of the New Deal and a former Crimson president, enjoyed widespread support from the U.S. population at large.</span></p> <p><span>Thernstrom says that despite the change in political allegiances, Harvard's views on economic and social issues have always reflected the opinions of the upper-middle class Northeastern establishment.</span></p> <p><span>\"The Harvard student body has always reflected elite opinion in the U.S., not the opinion of the general public,\" he says. \"Back in the old days, the elite was solidly conservative.\"</span></p> <p><span>The elite is now more liberal.</span></p> <p><span>One presidential candidate, former Senator Bill Bradley, has draped his campaign in the language of the political left.</span></p> <p><span>A majority of Harvard students polled chose Bradley for president.

Four-fifths favor legalizing  gay marriage.</span></p> <p><span>\"Harvard students are not fundamentalist.

In a 1956 survey of graduating seniors at Harvard, a full 25 percent of respondents said they thought military service would be a valuable and rewarding experience.</span></p> <p><span>Ponnuru says that in the past, military service was as ubiquitous for American males coming out of elite schools as a career in business is today.</span></p> <p><span>\"It was a conversation opener to ask 'Where did you serve?' much the way we now ask 'What do you do?,\"  he says.</span></p> <p><span>The majority of Harvard students say they would be willing to serve in the military, but only if they agreed with the cause. Only 20 percent said they would risk their lives for their country regardless of the cause.</span></p> <p><span>It's a trend that Nash and others find disturbing.</span></p> <p><span>Nash argued that it is up to the nation at large, and its elected leaders, to say whether a war is worth fighting, and not the individual soldiers involved in the battle.</span></p> <p><span>\"People that serve in the military don't get to make that choice. They serve the democratically elected leadership of the nation,\" he said. \"It's a concept that folks ought to think about.\"</span></p> <p><span>Thernstrom said he thought Harvard student's unwillingness to serve unless they were personally committed to the cause was a result of a perceived \"elite status\" among Harvard students.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is a sense of entitlement and privilege that comes through,\" he said. \"[In the past,] a more traditional working-class kid would have thought 'if my country calls me I will go.'\"</span></p>"}

For some students, the gulf between Northern and Southern life causes culture shock.</span></p> <p><span>\"There are times when I think I can't wait to go back to Alabama and get away from this craziness,\" Barkley says.  \"And then there are times when you think, 'This makes sense, but we wouldn't do that in the South, would we?'\"</span></p> <p><span>Harvard students, too, hold many preconceptions about Southerners.</span></p> <p><span>\"People always have conceptions of what people in the South are like,\" Barkley says.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Just the Facts, Ma'am </b><p> </p><p></p></font>No wonder Southerners are underrepresented at Harvard. Take a look at the numbers.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>While U.S. Census Bureau projections for 1997 indicate that 31.5 percent of the nation's population lives in the South, only 15.2 percent of Harvard's student body is Southern, according to Harvard News Office statistics.</span></p> <p><span>Students from the Northeast fill the gap left by the shortage of Southerners. While 25.6 percent of the U.S. population resides in the Northeast, 48.1 percent of Harvard's population comes from that region.</span></p> <p><span>Some might say that's not surprising, considering that as recently as 1996, 80 percent of first-years who graduated from high school the previous year went to college in their home states. But it isn't so easy to explain away the gap between the South and Harvard, the most elite school of the vaunted Ivy League.</span></p> <p><span>Distance is a factor, but not the deciding one. While 16 percent of the U.S. population lives in the Pacific states, 14 percent of Harvard's student body calls that region home. That's only a 12.5 percent gap in representation; for the South, the gap is a whopping 51.8 percent.</span></p> <p><span>And California ranks third among Harvard undergraduates' home states. The plane ride from the University to the West Coast is long, but the cultural chasm between Cambridge and the South is even wider. And politics is a hefty part of the reason.</span></p> <p><span>The South is a bastion of conservatism. In both the 1992 and 1996 elections, the Clinton-Gore ticket carried only two Southern states, excluding their home states of Arkansas and Tennessee. But they carried every state in the Northeast both times--and in 1996, the Democrats took Massachusetts with 63 percent of the vote, the highest of any state.</span></p> <p><span>That's not to say that all Southerners are conservative, or that all conservatives are Southern. But many Southern students at Harvard say the difference between the regions is still perceptible.</span></p> <p><span>The political distinctions are mirrored by longstanding cultural traditions--family, history and home. For the most part, the South disapproves of Northerners' fast-paced lifestyles, harsh winter weather and abrupt manner. And in turn, many Northerners stereotype residents of the South, lumping them into one mint julep-sippin', tobacco-spittin', slow-talkin' conservative evangelist.</span></p> <p><span>\"There is definitely a culture to the South that involves homecoming games and football and being active in church while you're a student, and I think it is probably reasonable to say that there is a cultural bias to coming up North.  Harvard has a reputation for being very liberal and atheist and other sorts of things,\" says Beth A. Stewart '00, a Georgia conservative and former Undergraduate Council president.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>We Are Family </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Often, family ties discourage Southern students from going to college in Massachusetts. Many Southerners say they pride themselves on loyalty to family and state. With such deep roots, students instinctively look within the region for educational opportunity.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>\"[Southern high school graduates are] more likely to go where their parents went or where their sisters or brothers are,\" says M. Rachael Lovett '03, a native of Owensboro, Ky.</span></p> <p><span><b></b>That's especially true when students have legacies at Southern colleges. Justin A. Barkley '02 sometimes gets a reminder of his Southern heritage when he talks to his grandmother.</span></p> <p><span>\"She'll say, 'You should have gone to Vanderbilt. That's where your grandfather went,'\" says Barkley, who grew up in Birmingham, Ala.</span></p> <p><span>According to Stewart, Southern grandmothers are worried about more than just where ancestors went to school.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think every kid from the South here has at least one grandmother who has warned them about the heathens in the North,\" she says.</span></p> <p><span>Families' warnings directly affect college applications.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b></b></font>Every year, Father David Zettel shepherds about 300 boys at Trinity High School in Louisville, Ky. through the college application process. After 30 years of college advising, he says Southern applicants live as though the Mason-Dixon line still exists.</span></p> <p><span>\"The tendency is to think South before you think North, before you think East,\" Zettel wrote in an e-mail message. \"The South connotes a more leisurely, less stressful lifestyle. Southerners are generally perceived as more friendly and welcoming... Even intellectual matters and pursuits...play out in a more relaxed manner in a Southern clime.\"</span></p> <p><span>Less than 1percent of last year's graduating class at Trinity went to school in the Northeast.</span></p> <p><span>According to Director of Admissions Marlyn McGrath-Lewis '71-'73, it's not just a Southern issue: in general, the farther away students live, the harder it is to recruit them.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's a law of nature,\" she says.</span></p> <p><span>Harvard has historically had problems recruiting students not only from the South, but also from the Midwest, she says.</span></p> <p><span>\"We've done very well in the South recently,\" she adds. \"But we've had to work very hard at that.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Southern high schoolers are especially resistant to colleges in other regions, being \"more preoccupied with where they're from,\" Lovett says.</span></p> <p><span>Gattman says his guidance counselor encouraged him to stick close to Alabama in his choice of schools. Even after he got into Harvard, she told him to apply in-state to keep his options open.</span></p> <p><span>\"I told her where I was going and she was like, 'Are you sure you're making the right decision?'\" Gattman says. \"It was such a bizarre thing that it was kind of hard for her to swallow.\"</span></p> <p><span>McGrath-Lewis says the admission officers are fighting tradition.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's not that we're competing against other Ivy League schools,\" she says.</span></p> <p><span>She points out that the South is known for its excellent, inexpensive public education. Compared to state schools in the South, Harvard's tuition seems astronomical, especially since some Southerners are unwilling to take out loans to attend college.</span></p> <p><span>\"I know people in the South who are very distrustful of loans,\" Lovett says.</span></p> <p><span>That makes state schools much more attractive to some Southern students.</span></p> <p><span>\"It's the local winners,\" McGrath- Lewis says.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Y'all Come Back Now </b><p> </p><p></p></font>Coming to Harvard can be tough, but coming home can be tougher. Students from more conservative regions often face questions about their loyalty and values when they return.</span></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p><span>Lovett says Southerners will often comment disapprovingly that those who leave think they are \"too good to go to school in [their] state.\"</span></p> <p><span>Furthermore, many of their peers see leaving the South as a sign of an inflated ego or a rejection of their own states, rather than just a desire to expand their horizons, Lovett says.</span></p> <p><span>According to Berry, cultural distance from Harvard isn't exclusively a Southern phenomenon. Her home state of Colorado, she says, isn't enchanted with the Harvard mystique.</span></p> <p><span>People at home, Berry says, think of Harvard as a \"snobby, back-East school.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"My teachers discouraged me from it,\" she says. \"A school like Harvard was a waste of money. The University of Colorado was just as good educationally... Most of my family felt that I shouldn't come here. My parents weren't particularly excited.\"</span></p> <p><span>Berry notes that at Harvard, most students view Yale as the primary rival institution. On the West Coast, she says, students are talking about Stanford, not Yale.</span></p> <p><span>Lovett's Kentucky friends were particularly skeptical of her choice because of Harvard's size.</span></p> <p><span>\"It wasn't so much a reaction to going out of state as a reaction to my going to Harvard,\" Lovett says. \"There was a big thing with it being big.\"</span></p> <p><span>The power of those preconceptions is often impossible to break, Stewart says.</span></p> <p><span>\"I think Harvard has a responsibility to overcome obstacles that are a part of people's backgrounds,\" she says. \"People that are capable but don't think they could get in, for example.

Many women on campus question whether, despite the apparent equality, they have the same opportunities as their male colleagues and friends.. Today's problems, they say, may be less visible than the outward discrimination earlier in the century, but they are just as inhibiting and repressive.</span></p> <p><span>The bra-burning, placard-carrying image of feminism may no longer be accurate, but women say activism, perhaps of a different sort, is still needed.</span></p> <p><span>\"I came to realize that Harvard was also a white, male institution like any other,\" says Sophia Chang '01, who is the former co-chair of Girlspot, a group for campus lesbians, bisexuals and questioning women. \"In fact, this is the belly of the beast. If there's any place to be this is it. If you're fighting the beast, stay in the belly, find out where it goes.\"</span></p> <p><span>Women's groups at Harvard have mobilized and united in recent months as several large issues played themselves out on campus. On Oct. 1, Radcliffe College merged with Harvard and lost its status as an independent college. Last spring the Faculty voted to dismiss two male undergraduates who had been convicted in the courts of sexual assault.</span></p> <p><span>These two issues galvanized the campus to action--at least for a couple months. But some of the most vocal activists on campus say they feel the majority of the student body is largely apathetic about women's issues.</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>At Harvard Today </b><p> </p></font>While most Harvard undergraduates say the feminist movement has been beneficial to the advancement of women, few have actively aligned themselves with the movement on campus.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>\"I think there is a strong feminist presence on campus that doesn't necessarily make itself known,\" says Shauna L. Shames '01, a member of the Coalition Against Sexual Violence and an advocate for the creation of a women's center at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>A core group of students on campus have set out to counteract what they see as difficulties facing women at Harvard. The Radcliffe Union of Students (RUS), the Women's Leadership Project (WLP) and the Coalition Against Sexual Violence have been some of the most vocal supporters of women's issues.</span></p> <p><span>Campus women's groups have joined together this winter to write a Women's Guide to Harvard that will include information about women's resources--both academic and extra-curricular.  It will be modeled in format after the Unofficial Guide to Life at Harvard, a book that is distributed to every first year.</span></p> <p><span>Kamil E. Redmond '00, the former undergraduate council vice-president who is spearheading the effort with Peggy T. Lim '00, says the editors hope to have the guide put together in time to mail to all incoming female first-years.</span></p> <p><span>\"There will be copies available for men too if they want them,\" she adds.</span></p> <p><span>And after the demise of Radcliffe, women say they need a space on campus to call their own.</span></p> <p><span>Women can no longer use the Lyman Common Room in Agassiz House, a space that was used in the past as an area to hold meetings, gather with friends and generally discuss women's issues.</span></p> <p><span>\"Radcliffe is over, throw us a bone,\" Redmond says.</span></p> <p><span>Over the last year, there has been a large push from women's groups and from the council to create a women's center where groups could congregate, distribute informative literature, gather with other women and perhaps stay at night if they don't feel comfortable returning to their rooms.</span></p> <p><span>But space is a rare commodity at Harvard, and there is little consensus about where the women's center would be located. Kate B. Clancy '01 suggests the middle of the Yard.</span></p> <p><span>\" I'd put it in the middle of the Yard so that people walking by it everyday would know that Harvard is actively interested in women,\" Clancy says.</span></p> <p><span>Yet, the women's center seems an unlikely possibility.  College administrators have been reluctant to endorse the idea for a center that would only serve females.</span></p> <p><span>While the Faculty prepared to vote last spring on the dismissal of two students who were convicted of rape, much of the campus was abuzz about the threat of sexual violence at Harvard.</span></p> <p><span>Many activists say they still do not feel the campus is safe, and they urge the administration to take sexual violence seriously.</span></p> <p><span>\"I've become much more involved this year after the high profile campus rapes,\" says David B. Orr '01, a member of the council who has sponsored several bills dealing with gender issues.  \"I was amazed no one was dealing with women's issues.\"</span></p> <p><span>He adds, \"Part of the issue of sexual violence is that the students at the University don't appreciate the size of the problem.\"</span></p> <p><span><font face=\"Verdana, Arial,Helvetica\"><b>Still Relevant? </b><p> </p></font>Even as activists on campus unite in their feminist cause, some question whether the movement is still necessary today--both at Harvard and in society at large--at a time when women have gained so many opportunities.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>\"Feminism today is absolutely important, as most women's issues effect everyone, as they involve</span></p> <p><span>equality, fairness, and family,\" Orr says. \"But it's also important to recognize the progress that's been made.\"</span></p> <p><span>The majority of students believe that the feminist movement was beneficial to the advancement of women.  The Crimson's poll showed that 65 percent of those questioned agree that feminism has been good for the advancement of women, and only 8 percent disagree or strongly disagree.</span></p> <p><span>But many worry that students think feminism is only a thing of the past.</span></p> <p><span>\"'Feminism is dead,' say leaders.

{"title": "Candidates See Today's Caucuses as Test of Strength | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>In schools, libraries and even some private homes, Iowa residents will gather tonight to start the months-long process of selecting delegates to the Democratic and Republican National conventions.</span></p> <p><span>The Iowa Caucus--a national presidential campaign institution since 1972--will take place in about 2,100 locations across the state. About 200,000 voters are expected to participate.</span></p> <p><span>Though Iowa is small-- states like California and New York will send many more delegates to the conventions and are better indicators of how a candidate will fare nationally--it is the first real test of candidates' popularity and their ability to organize groups of voters.</span></p> <p><span>Iowa can help or hurt candidates in several ways.</span></p> <p><span>The first indicator of a possible turn-around in the campaign is if a candidate surpasses all expectations in Iowa, garnering more support than the polls currently indicate.  This happened in 1976, when Jimmy Carter, a virtual unknown nationally, catapulted himself into the lead and, eventually, into the Democratic nomination. Since 1972, all presidential nominees have finished at least third in the caucuses.</span></p> <p><span>As of yesterday, polls suggest that both Republican and Democratic frontrunners, George W. Bush and Al Gore '69, have commanding leads in the state.</span></p> <p><span>But the other candidates have stepped up their campaigns--even though they know they will not gain the most votes.</span></p> <p><span>While Bush is the first choice of Iowa voters, polling about 42 percent, publisher Steve Forbes runs second at 20 percent.  He hopes a strong finish will give his campaign organization momentum and help to draw more conservative Republicans to his fundraisers.  Forbes has run a barrage of television ads in the last few days, accusing Bush of reneging on a plan to cut Texas taxes.</span></p> <p><span>Bush's closest competitor on a national scale, Arizona senator John R. McCain, has largely ignored the caucus, and has been relegated to the third tier of candidates along with Alan L. Keyes '72 and Gary Bauer, who have four percent of voters' support between them. McCain's decision not to support ethanol subsidies, which Iowa farmers rely on, has made him unpopular in the state, though the candidate claims the subsidy is unnecessarily protectionist. Bypassing Iowa has allowed McCain to spend his time and money in New Hampshire, where most polls show him tied with Bush.</span></p> <p><span>In the Democratic contest in Iowa, Gore leads Bradley by 56 percent to 28 percent, according to the latest poll. Bradley has spent $2 million dollars in the state. His campaign hopes for a stronger showing than the predicted by the polls.  A stronger-than-expected showing in Iowa could give Bradley a \"bounce\" in New Hampshire's primary nine days from now, where he polls evenly against the Vice President.</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday, Bradley received the endorsement from the Des Moines Register, the most influential paper in the state.</span></p> <p><span>For both Bradley and McCain, the decision whether or not to canvas Iowa also involves their belief in the state's influence on later primaries.</span></p> <p><span>Bradley is hoping for the kind of surprise victory that the former Georgia governor Carter earned in 1976, a victory which helped him gain legitimacy, and may have given him the necessary name-recognition to win the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>McCain is operating on the opposite premise that the Iowa caucus has little influence on the rest of the primary campaign, and that the New Hampshire primary is a better indicator of overall strength. His case study would be George Bush, who in 1980 won the Iowa caucus but lost the presidential nomination, and in 1988 lost the caucus and won the nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Evidence for the \"bounce\" theory can be gathered from the 1980 caucus, where Sen. Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56 (D-Mass.) got 31.2 percent of the vote in Iowa against Carter's 56 percent, and Carter went on to take New Hampshire by a wide margin. On the other hand, in the same year Bush won the Iowa caucus, the eventual Republican nominee (and subsequent president), Ronald W. Reagan, took New Hampshire only eight days later.</span></p> <p><span>Despite all the hype about Iowa, the true test for the candidates won't be for at least a month. On March 7, also known as \"Super Tuesday\", 15 states, including New York and California, will have their primaries.</span></p>"}
{"title": "Notes from Underground | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>There are few sights more beautiful than Harvard Yard at night in the middle of a snowstorm. The red brick buildings shine against the white snow, and the Yard is quiet except for the shouts of first-years in snowball fights. The beauty almost makes you forget the downside of winter weather.</span></p> <p><span>But when the storm is over, the cold and darkness return, the aesthetics are limited, and we become House-bound with ample time to surf the Web and catch up on some political debates we might have happily been ignoring in favor of making a snow angel or two. When we're hunkered down inside, unable to enjoy the outdoors, we are left to contemplate some of the hot issues of the year in this January without a thaw--among them the ongoing religious exploits of George W. Bush, the future of abortion in America and the ongoing issue of education reform in the midst of Massachusetts politics.</span></p> <p><span>If anyone had the misfortune to load the New York Times Web site on Saturday morning around 11:30, she would have seen a photo of George W. Bush and Jesus Christ, a carefully cropped picture of the presidential candidate speaking in a chapel which had a mural of Christ behind the pulpit. My question is: did the photographer/editor mean the cropping to be a mischievous reference to Bush's steady invocations of Christ on the campaign trail, did he mean it to be a positive commentary on the Republican front-runner, or was it just a coincidence? If it was the latter, let's hope it's the last. Religious imagery and rhetoric in politics are alarming both because of the moral superiority implied by candidates who eagerly proclaim their faith and because of the time devoted to exclusionary religious discussion which should be spent on policy issues that matter to voters regardless of their religion.</span></p> <p><span>Also on Saturday, at a Democratic fund-raiser President Clinton pointed out that the future of free access to abortion may rest in the outcome of the 2000 presidential election. His speech, juxtaposed with the announcement by the liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg that she is continuing successful treatment for colon cancer, reminds us just how significant each position on the Court really is.</span></p> <p><span>The next president may have the power to change the composition of the Supreme Court into a group with the numbers to overturn Roe v. Wade. Candidate Bush's clarification of his anti-abortion stance last week was unsurprising but also indicative of the strength of that plank of the Republican platform. As we mark the 27th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, the possible abandonment of a woman's right to choose is a thought scary enough to make you board the next Democratic campaign bus to New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span>Students campaigning for candidates in New Hampshire might remember that the Democratic winner in that state's primary in 1992 was former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas. Though his victory was overshadowed by Clinton's famous Comeback-Kid spin on his second-place finish, the late senator was an honorable and intelligent candidate. The irony of Governor A. Paul Cellucci's delivery of his State of the State address from the blue-collar city of Lowell, Tsongas' hometown, was therefore particularly striking to this Massachusetts resident. Cellucci's administration, which has been rightly charged with abusing the perks of power, was suddenly making the point of visiting a town of real people.</span></p> <p><span>In the midst of a series of angry statements directed to State Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham '72 and Speaker of the House Thomas  M. Finneran, the governor's confrontational and vague call for the testing of math teachers in order to improve students' MCAS scores particularly emphasized Cellucci's reluctance to work towards intelligent compromise with his Democratic opponents.</span></p> <p><span>While we're still in the deep freeze, there's much for us to consider as we sit huddled in the relative warmth of our dorms and classrooms. Political activism is naturally on the rise in an election year, and it is inspirational to see the busloads of Harvard students heading to New Hampshire to campaign for their chosen candidates.</span></p> <p><span>But behind the personalities of the candidates and the elected officials who have been in full view on our computer and television screens in the last month are the shadows of the issues themselves, issues worth standing out in the cold to fight about. The role of religion on the political stage, the future of abortion rights and the demands for education reform all deserve our strongest attention and discussion. The end of January brings our first official week-long intersession--take a day or two of that leisure time for political activism.</span></p> <p><span><i>Susannah B.

{"title": "The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span><font size=\"+1\">\"Questions, let's see, up first is up front.\" Alan L. Keyes '72--the arch-conservative Republican presidential candidate--is taking questions after a fiery stump speech. He's spent the past half hour attacking \"the radical homosexual agenda\" and condemning abortion as murder.</font></span></p> <p><span>Starting his Q&amp;A, Keyes can't resist the determined-looking young woman with a huge yellow 'Choice' button pinned to her chest. He knows what's coming and he doesn't think twice. Ten minutes later, he chastises the moderator of the event, who is trying to steer the microphone away from another would-be critic, a University of Wisconsin student. \"Let me direct the microphone, if you don't mind,\" shouts Keyes, his voice a mixture of fearsome preacher and irritated muppet.</span></p> <p><span>Throughout the question and answer period, the raised hands of the gray-shirted Keyes youth minions go unnoticed as the candidate takes on all challengers. After the speech, the University of Wisconsin student approaches the candidate and tells him that the microphone-handler was deliberately trying to avoid him.</span></p> <p><span>\"I know,\" Keyes says. But that's not his approach. \"I look around to see who looks like they're intent on challenging me.\"</span></p> <p><span>Alan Lee Keyes is an evangelical conservative. He wants your vote, but he cares more about converting you to the cause. If you waver, even slightly, he'll pounce. Leading Republican number two, Senator John McCain, recently faced Keyes' fury for daring to suggest that he enjoyed Nine Inch Nails.</span></p> <p><span>\"Don't you think that as leaders we ought to be a little bit more serious about the kind of influences that are now destroying the lives of our children, and before we open our mouths, we ought to know what we're talking about?\" he asked a stupefied McCain. The Senator stammered, telling Keyes he was only trying to be amusing. Keyes shot back, \"I'm a father and I'm not laughing, I'm really not.\"</span></p> <p><span>Many who witness his wild pronouncements from the stump are left to wonder at his, to put it delicately, sense of balance.</span></p> <p><span>\"If I were to lose my mind right now and pick one of you up and bash your head against the floor and kill you, would that be right?\" Keyes asked his audience of ten-year-olds last week at a New Hampshire elementary school. He was looking for a \"no,\" hoping to equate such a psychotic act to that of abortion.</span></p> <p><span>If being the silver-tongued apostle of conservatism seems like an odd calling for a man who graduated from Harvard just three years after the University Hall takeover, in the midst of revolt against God and country, well, it seemed that way back then, too. Keyes was practically run out of Cornell, where he spent the first years of his college career--a sore subject. Asked how he ended up at Harvard rather than Cornell, Keyes refers cryptically to \"the context of events\" surrounding the takeover of Willard Straight Hall in 1969. Is he the black student described whose life was threatened by black militants when he opposed the armed takeover, recounted in Allan Bloom's best-selling <i>Closing of the American Mind</i>? \"Yes, that's me,\" says the rarely monosyllabic Keyes.</span></p> <p><span>Keyes came to Harvard on the advice of Bloom, his mentor who left Cornell in disgust himself after the takeover. By the time Keyes arrived in Cambridge--after spending a year in Paris--the heyday of activism had passed. \"The whole nature of the situation had calmed down,\" he says. \"At Harvard I mainly concentrated on my work....That's when I did my most serious work, trying to think through political life in general,\" adds the candidate, a government concentrator whose favorite classes were the political theory offerings of Harvey C. Mansfield '53, now Kenan Professor of Government.</span></p> <p><span>\"He spoke a lot, and always very articulately. He didn't stumble or hesitate,\" recalls Mansfield, who was introduced to the someday-candidate through Allan Bloom. Mansfield ultimately supervised Keyes' senior thesis and, later, his doctoral dissertation. \"He was quite studious and when he had free time, I think he usually spent it thinking and talking politics.\"</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, Keyes may be the only candidate who really didn't smoke pot, do cocaine, or, in fact, do much of anything during his college career--Keyes' 1972 yearbook entry lists not a single extracurricular activity or club. But college friend Marlo Lewis recalls not only Keyes' enthusiasm for distance running, but his love for singing opera. \"He was very proficient as an opera singer, singing in churches and choirs, giving recitals--one of the nicest voices I've ever heard, a beautiful tenor,\" says Lewis. He could also pick out tunes on the guitar--Mansfield recalls a particular fondness for Cornell fight songs. He lived in Adams House with Bill Kristol '73, son of famed neo-conservative Irving K. and himself founder of the conservative Weekly Standard. Even in his entertainment, Keyes aimed to be a beacon of principle. He liked movies, \"particularly movies that have some political or moral dimension,\" Lewis says. <i>Richard III</i> and John Wayne classic <i>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</i> were favorites.</span></p> <p><span>While Harvard's other presidential contender--a man named Gore--buries Harvard references as deep as they go and plays up his tenuous Tennessee farming connections, Keyes plasters Harvard all over his literature. His standard introduction and self-description notes his Harvard government Ph.D. and refers to him as a \"true intellectual.\" \"It's always something that's mentioned, that he got his degrees from Harvard. It shows people he's a scholar, that he's intelligent,\" according to Dimitri Smierenski, the national coordinator of Students for Keyes2000. He says that Keyes likes to say he's not sure who's quicker to disown the other--Harvard or Keyes. \"Just a joke,\" Keyes explains. But he says most conservatives forgive him for his Harvard background rather than embrace him for it. And while he comes back once in a while to visit classes and speak, Harvard, needless to say, has not offered much of a student support base.</span></p> <p><span>So now Keyes is running for president. His numbers are low, way low, save his third place finish in the Iowa caucuses. If second place is the first loser, it's hard to know what to call a man who breathes a sigh of relief at coming in number three. His showing in New Hampshire paled in comparison, a more realistic marker of Keyes' stature among Republican candidates. His campaign--run on a shoestring budget, with the fewest dollars of all the major Republican contenders--is mostly about Keyes talking, whether in person (where they'll let him), in the televised debates or in the audio- and videotapes distributed by the campaign: Keyes on his radio show, Keyes making a fourth of July speech, Keyes on \"Politically Incorrect,\" sparring with a former member of Duran Duran on the role of religion in democracy.</span></p> <p><span>The strategy seems to be that the unfiltered candidate is the campaign's best asset. And while it's not a strategy that's destined to make the Harvard alum our next president, it has won him a devoted following. Even those who would never vote for him are wowed by his oratory; a majority of respondents to a poll after the first Republican debate declared him the winner. Despite his meager funds, he finished a surprising third in the Iowa Caucuses, behind only Texas Governor George  W. Bush and Forbes Magazine Publisher Steve Forbes.</span></p> <p><span>Keyes' big issues are the foundations of social conservatism--pro-life, anti-homosexual, and \"pro-family.\" He opposes gun control and would, in his pipe-dream administration, abolish the federal income tax. He favors school prayer. Keyes stands out among similar arch-conservatives for his firebrand speaking, filled with harangues against the immoral left and punctuated with index fingers gesturing upwards, probably to Almighty God. And while these stands are boilerplate conservative--or at least boilerplate far, far right conservative--Keyes is close to unique in the party for his race talk. He is one of very few Republicans willing to argue that the party of Lincoln is still the party which best defends African-Americans. Liberals, he contends, have damaged the black community. \"Instead of working with the churches and working with the institutions and working with the leadership constituted by the community itself, they started to set up a government-dominated structure and a government-dominated leadership that in fact, I believe, helped undermine the structures of moral self-sufficiency in the black community,\" he says.</span></p> <p><span>In the midst of his wild vociferation, Keyes tends to take the sensitive question of race a bit far. The income tax? Like slavery. Opposed to abortion? As a black person, he's particularly sensitive to the devaluation of human life, he says. Media coverage of his campaign? It's a \"black out to keep the black out.\" Of course, liberal candidates have long likened this or that policy to slavery, leveraging that special American moral vulnerability to attack altogether unrelated pieces of legislation, as Keyes does. It's a powerful rhetorical tool, and the appeal to blacks from the party of Lincoln is too often missing. But if these arguments draw votes, they aren't coming from African-Americans. \"There are certain elements within the black community who find it interesting that a black person can step forward and say these things,\" says Ambassador Charles M. Lichenstein, a conservative thinktanker who knew Keyes during his ambassadorial days and remains a friend. \"They're fascinated by Alan. But are they really part of the constituency? No.\" The word on the political street is that Keyes' Iowa showing will likely be his best of the campaign--and his performance there can't have much to do with Iowa's virtually non-existent black population.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, Keyes draws mostly from the religious right--\"people of a very traditionalist orientation,\" as Lichenstein puts it. Despite the Protestantism of conservatives in the American heartland, Keyes, a devout Catholic, still finds a passionate common ground on issues that religious conservatives see as nothing short of Biblical. \"Alan deeply believes that abortion is murder,\" Lichenstein says. \"In this sense, he and John Paul II--you would find no difference between them. Because of the depth of his belief, he could not possibly do otherwise.\"</span></p> <p><span>Keyes argues that the Constitution does not mandate separation of church and state. He peppers his speeches with words that leave no doubt as to his religious background. His aides introduce him as a \"servant of God,\" and in a recent speech he referred not only to \"God Almighty\" and the \"Creator God,\" but also to Living God, God's Favor, the hands of God, the authority of God, God's Will, God's Word, God's Voice and--an Alan Keyes original--\"God's Smiling Face.\" He responds with an \"amen\" after a particularly pious comment from the crowd.</span></p> <p><span>Those who knew him detect an increased emphasis on religion since his days as a student and a foreign service officer, but Keyes shrugs that off. \"The religious element has become more prominent in my life,\" he says. \"But I don't think it's become more important in my politics, no. Then and now, I believe that the defining principles of my life are stated in the Declaration of Independence. Nothing has changed about that.\"</span></p> <p><span>\"I think the reason it seems more of an emphasis these days,\" he adds, \"is because 25 or 30 years ago, I think there was much less of a tendency to consider it unusual. We've pushed God farther and farther out of our political realm.\"</span></p> <p><span>His supporters refer to \"Ambassador Keyes,\" but for a man who never served as the top United States representative to any nation, the title is a bit hyperbolic.  Nonetheless, his career in international diplomacy got him to wherever it is he is now. In the early 1980s, the legendary Jeane Kirkpatrick, soon to be named Ronald Reagan's ambassador to the U.N., was travelling through India with three other Americans, debating capitalism, socialism and democracy with Indian intellectuals, none of whom subscribed to philosophies even remotely resembling Reaganonmics.</span></p> <p><span>\"We were outnumbered enormously in the general discussions, 40-3, in terms of positions and points of view and all that,\" Kirkpatrick says. \"Then from the back of the room--it was all dark--there came a rather eloquent argument on our side. I couldn't imagine who it was. I felt the argument was being stated more effectively from out of the dark than I had been able to do at that stage,\" she says. Keyes--then a low-level foreign service officer in Bombay--became a dinner companion and a friend. When Kirkpatrick received her U.N. post, she thought of Keyes. Kirkpatrick had unusual autonomy from Reagan to handpick her underlings, and fought for the appointment even though the decision to pass over others with more experience upset some officials in the State Department. \"They said they had a minorities program, and that it might be discouraging to other minorities,\" Kirkpatrick says. \"But we worked it out.\"</span></p> <p><span>The Cold War was at its coldest, and Keyes the Ambassador--much like Keyes the Candidate--was an aggressive speaker. \"His style was confrontational but in a rational manner,\" says Lichenstein, who also served as an ambassador under Reagan. \"This was a period when adversarial relationships were central to our international relations.\" Between that ambassadorship and the beginning of his career as a presidential long shot, Keyes worked as assistant secretary of state in the Reagan administration. He then twice challenged an incumbent Democrat for a Maryland senate seat--yet another improbable quest. \"He had no deep roots anywhere in particular,\" Lichenstein says. Keyes, an army brat, spent his childhood in various cities and towns across the country, wherever his father was stationed, and eventually graduated from high school in Texas. \"When he began running for the senate, he had almost no ties to the state of Maryland,\" Lichenstein says. \"Maryland is an intensely Democratic state. It almost never elects Republicans of the type like Alan.\"</span></p> <p><span>Most candidates might take those losses as a signal to shoot lower, but Keyes set his eyes on an even more Quixotic prize, seeking the Republican nomination in 1996, and again this year. While Keyes' strong showing in Iowa drew attention to his campaign, this man will not be your next president. His only ventures into electoral politics have been losses--rather dramatic ones in fact. And if his fire and brimstone rhetoric earns the support of some ultra-conservatives within the Republican Party, it isn't a big draw for mainstream voters. \"Frankly, I wouldn't have expected him to be running for president. I've been very surprised,\" says Kirkpatrick, who helped introduce him to Maryland Republicans before his Senate attempts. \"He doesn't have that kind of background that most people have who run for president. He hasn't held elected office.\"</span></p> <p><span>As an undergraduate, he had other endgames in mind than the presidency. He considered enlisting in the army. He contemplated a career in opera. Even after he went for politics, friends say they expected him to be a thinktank policy guru or a professor of political science--a job Keyes says he may eventually consider--rather than a presidential sideshow. Die-hard Keyes supporters--as such people always do--have an intricate, domino theory detailing a Keyes win: Bauer, Hatch and Forbes will drop out, and their supporters will turn to Keyes to form a solid conservative block. Then, once Bush's supporters see a conservative candidate with a substantial following, they'll question whether Bush is such a foregone conclusion and move toward Keyes.  But though Keyes' third-place finish in Iowa has buoyed supporters, polls show his support running in the single digits in the rest of America. And even friends put his chances of victory at slim to nil. He's not going anywhere except back to Maryland.  \"I don't think he for a moment believes he's going to win the nomination,\" Lichenstein says. \"He's not going to be a candidate for president, or the president of the United States. But then again, hardly anyone who runs is.\"</span></p> <p><span>At the podium, Keyes talks the same brash, victory-confident speech of the rest of the candidates. But on the telephone, he says this has all come a little unexpectedly.  \"The fact that I have gotten involved in this came as a surprise to me,\" he says. \"It still does, sometimes.\" But Mansfield, ever the sage, says his one-time protege's presidential bid is not so unexpected. \"It doesn't surprise me,\" Mansfield says. \"I always thought he was taken by Alexander Hamilton's phrase in the Federalist Papers that love of fame is the ruling passion of the noblest minds.\"</span></p> <p><span>In fact, the phrase is the epigraph to a chapter of Keyes' doctoral dissertation, written on ambition and statesmanship. Writing about Hamilton, Keyes argues that popular government relies on \"individuals who would rise above the current of ordinary passion.\" Hamilton, Keyes continued, was no advocate of patriotic moderation. Government, he wrote, \"involves the disposition to apply oneself unremittingly to the service of the nation.\" Keyes takes the classroom to his campaign. These are not academic questions for the ambassador. The other Republican candidates are unwilling to fulfill the role of moral steward, sketched out by Hamilton. \"George W. Bush...is incapable of articulating the challenge facing our country in any way. Therefore, if our party nominates him, he will lose,\" Keyes declares. \"The challenge of our party is to say the failure of Democrats on moral stewardship deserves that the White House be taken away from them.\"</span></p> <p><span>But Keyes isn't going to take anything. His biggest contribution to his cause, he knows, is his argumentative presence. The nation stands to learn from a Harvard section big-mouth. \"That's actually more important than winning,\" Keyes concedes.</span></p>"}
{"title": "The Forgotten Foreign Agenda | Opinion | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>The days of the antiwar liberals are long past. President Clinton's offensive foreign policy strategy is accountable for almost one-third of the casualties in Yugoslavia's civil war. His pilots have bombed a Chinese embassy. He has ordered an attack on a Sudanese pharmaceutical factory that a Dateline NBC report suggested may have been merely a civilian facility. His sanctions have killed more than a million innocent Iraqi civilians through malnutrition and easily preventable diseases.</span></p> <p><span>Even more troubling, however, is that the killing of this magnitude has become business as usual, especially on the campaign trail. While Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John S. McCain (R-Ariz.) trumpet this bipartisan massacre--claiming that this places foreign policy \"above politics\"--their complacency abdicates the opposition party's duty to provide the nation with a choice. Consequently, most important foreign policy issues will be removed from the debate in the upcoming general election.</span></p> <p><span>The Clinton administration's foreign policy is as extraordinary for its reliance on lethal force as for its complete inability to inspire any kind of vocal antiwar opposition. Despite the impression cultivated by mainstream media, McCain and Bush agree on many of their issues. They equally support America's blank check security guarantee to Taiwan. Both have come out in support of NATO's expansion. McCain has spoken in favor of the Bosnian and Kosovar campaigns while Bush one-ups him with his vague promises to lend \"support\" to \"the Baltics, the Caucasus Central Asia and the Ukraine\" by \"promoting regional peace.\" And neither seems to have any qualms about the humanitarian implications of America's interventionism.</span></p> <p><span>For instance, the Yugoslavian air campaign is portrayed by both camps as, if anything, not aggressive enough. While Bush laments the president's decision not to use ground troops, McCain bemoans that \"most Americans cannot see the connection between our security and Mr. Milosevic's crimes.\" Never mind that these crimes, according to a recent U.N. report, resulted in only a tiny fraction of the casulaties claimed by Secretrary of Defense William S. Cohen.</span></p> <p><span>Neither of the two leading Republican presidential candidates appear to have lost as much as a wink of sleep over the million or more deaths caused by the Iraqi embargo. Bush and McCain both support enforcement of the sanctions, and McCain even openly demands the overthrow of Saddam's regime. One can only wonder how Bush and McCain can display such callous attitudes toward such blatant misinformation and destruction of innocent human life.</span></p> <p><span>Because of the Republican frontrunners' positions, it seems the American people won't have any foreign policy choices in the general election. Regardless which party wins, America will administer multiple Balkan protectorates, give out war guarantees as easily as they would popcorn and starve millions of innocent foreigners because they won't install the stooges of Uncle Sam. Although the next American president will have to pass judgement on whether or not it is in our interests to make Latvia a member of NATO, the electorate will not be able to express an opinion on this matter. It seems parties are prepared to nominate dyed in the wool internationalists.</span></p> <p><span>It makes sense that no candidate, in this day and age, would want the label of \"isolationist.\" But Republicans have fallen a long way since Ronald Reagan's reign, when intervention was at least employed as a means to a worthy end--the destruction of the Soviet Union. Today, Republicans endorse crusade after crusade, each time undertaking a newly permanent international commitment that results in more, rather than less, human suffering. Republicans have been intoxicated by a new internationalist machismo that offers one final claim to greatness by the leaders of the post-Cold War era. But eleven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it appears that the Evil Empire is now us.</span></p> <p><span><i>Steven R. Pirairo '02 is an economics concentrator in Leverett House.

George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore '69, last Tuesday's primary in New Hampshire may have been the blow that widened it. Bush and Gore, riding high on the backs of their party apparatuses and their victories in Iowa, came into the Granite State exuding the confidence of heirs apparent. Bush flaunted his legacy and name recognition, sharing the stage with George Sr. and Barbara; Gore played up his vice presidential status with his Secret Service entourage.</span></p> <p><span>But by day's end, although the two weren't knocked off their horses completely, the results of the New Hampshire primary were more than enough to rattle their hold on the reins. Sen. John S. McCain (R-Ariz.) finished ahead of Bush with a solid 19 percentage point victory. Although New Hampshire has a particular affinity for insurgent candidates, McCain drew broad-based support from Independent and Republican voters alike. For Bush, who waltzed into New Hampshire expecting to win, the defeat signifies that he will need more than deep pockets and a famous name to secure the Republican nomination.</span></p> <p><span>Former Sen. Bill Bradley drew an impressive 46 percent to Gore's 50 percent of the New Hampshire votes--a margin of less than 7,000 voters. Although Bradley was not Tuesday's victor, his performance is close enough to propel him into a competitive race with Gore for the Super Tuesday primaries on March 7.</span></p> <p><span>Both the feisty McCain and frank Bradley have passionately committed to continue campaigning until the end. This will inject spirit into a traditionally uncompetitive and uninspiring primary process. A heated and close race will lead to a more informed and politically active citizenry, as illustrated by the particularly high voter turnout in New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span>Despite McCain's stellar performance and Bradley's strong showing, both candidates have bumpy roads ahead. New Hampshire is a small state that sends only 17 Republican and 22 Democratic delegates to the summer's conventions. McCain will have a more difficult time in the upcoming South Carolina primaries, where registered Republicans are traditionally more conservative. Furthermore, both McCain and Bradley will not be privy to the large segment of independent voters.</span></p> <p><span>The dynamic of the primaries changes after New Hampshire. No longer will the candidates have the time to attend individual town meetings across a particular state. This will be difficult for Bradley, who prefers intimate face-to-face campaigning over staged press events. McCain will have to revise his strategy of dumping all his energies into one state after South Carolina.</span></p> <p><span>But in the end, the lesson from New Hampshire is that the campaigns will be hard fought from start to finish. The Republican and Democratic party establishments should take note that their chosen knights are capable of stumbling.</span></p>"}

{"title": "Voter by Voter, McCain's Volunteers Reach Out | News | The Harvard Crimson", "author": null, "body": "<p><span>-GILFORD, NH--If John McCain wins the New Hampshire primary Feb 1., he may well have his campaign volunteers to thank. The key to victory in New Hampshire, aside from television ads, is the degree to which candidates meet voters in person.</span></p> <p><span>There are about 747,000 registered voters in the state, and they cast their ballots at a rate higher than the national average. Given New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation status, candidates spend weeks there. If they try, they probably could meet a majority of the electorate.</span></p> <p><span>McCain himself has spent 56 days in the state and will likely add another seven to the total before the primary.</span></p> <p><span>For McCain's campaign organizers, ensuring that voters know where their candidate will be appearing--and convincing them to attend--is perhaps their most important task.</span></p> <p><span>They rely on volunteers, many of them from colleges in Massachusetts, to spread the McCain gospel.</span></p> <p><span>Early this past Saturday, four young men piled into two cars at a Mass Ave. gate leading to Harvard Law School, and began their two-hour trek to Gilford, a small town in the middle of  New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span>Tom Snider, a third-year student at the Law School, organized the trip for several of Harvard's other McCain supporters.</span></p> <p><span>During the two-hour car trip to Gilford, the conversation that passed between Snider and Daniel Choi, also a third-year Law School student, turned to why John McCain is the only presidential candidate for whom it is worth travelling to New Hampshire on a cold morning.</span></p> <p><span>They certainly wouldn't do so for Vice President Al Gore '69, they said.</span></p> <p><span>YAYA described Steve Forbes as, \"kind of goofy-looking,\" and Snider observed further that Forbes' wealth does not jive well with his self-proclaimed status as a Washington outsider.</span></p> <p><span>They also dismissed George W. Bush due to his being, \"too green,\" alluding to his perceived lack of experience with government at the national level.</span></p> <p><span>On the subject of McCain himself, Snider cited the candidate's \"refreshing\" approach to politics and campaigning.  Choi said that when he first heard McCain speak, he was struck immediately by the senator's eloquence. McCain was \"something special,\" and well-worth supporting.</span></p> <p><span>Their loyalties solidified, the students arrived at Gilford at eleven in the morning.</span></p> <p><span>Up to this point, these four students had no idea would be expected of them that day.  The duration of their stay was even up in the air--they had all come prepared to stay over in Manchester's YMCA until Sunday.</span></p> <p><span>The coordinator for McCain's New Hampshire's youth volunteers, Jenna Kolmeister, assigned each group of to a nearby town, both in the region around Lake Winnipesaukee, which weaves through the center of the state.</span></p> <p><span>Kolmeister gave the students a pile of orange fliers, announcing that at 7:30 a.m, in just two days, the candidate himself would meet with residents in Gilford.</span></p> <p><span>Snider, Choi, and the occupants of the second car, Adam Johnson '02, and Andy Kepple, a student at the University of Massachusetts at Amhest, were instructed to distribute the bulletins.</span></p> <p><span>The Pontiac traveled the short distance to Laconia. Snider and Choi began to walk the streets of the town.</span></p> <p><span>Glancing at the fliers, several citizens said they were already John McCain supporters, which encouraged the volunteers.</span></p> <p><span>Others, like Patty Moodie, were voters who said they  greatly valued the chance to meet McCain.</span></p> <p><span>Moodie hasn't yet decided whom she'll vote for Feb 1.</span></p> <p><span>But McCain is a strong possibility. \"I like the fact that he served in the military-- unlike Clinton.\"</span></p> <p><span>Military service was one of McCain's strong selling-points, trumpeted by many of his supporters this winter morning.</span></p> <p><span>But contrary to stereotype, not all New Hampshire residents expressed an enthusiasm for politics.</span></p> <p><span>When given a flier, the proprietor of a shoe repair store in Laconia, a man calling himself Armondi told the students, \"I'm nobody's supporter - I'm my own supporter.\"</span></p> <p><span>After a morning's work in the freezing temperatures, the four volunteers drove an hour to Plymouth, where they would regroup with other McCain stumpers.</span></p> <p><span>At Biederman's, a clean, cozy pub and deli, they relaxed with Kolmeister to watch McCain in that night's Republican candidate  debate in Iowa.</span></p> <p><span>Soon, the pub's small television room was filled with men, most of them advanced in age, all white-haired, wearing winter coats.  Many coats bore the pin of a POW or of a military division.</span></p> <p><span>The men--McCain's supporters and members of the New Hampshire's Veteran's Coalition---travel throughout New Hampshire to, in the words of McCain's deputy campaign manager Jimmy Martin, \"tell stories about [McCain's]character, service, and how they shape and guide him.\"</span></p> <p><span>One of the veterans, Orson Swindle, tells voters of the two years he spent sleeping next to John McCain in a Vietnam POW camp.</span></p> <p><span>This convinced him that McCain had \"a higher calling to the service of the country, not himself.\"</span></p> <p><span>Swindle, who is also a  commissioner with the Federal Trade Commission, is an effective proselytizer for McCain's cause, according to the citizens who stopped to chat with him.</span></p> <p><span>After a brief stop at McCain's campaign headquarters in Manchester, New Hampshire, the four headed home.</span></p> <p><span>They were successful in what they accomplished. That town meeting they advertised drew about 200 people,  despite the early hour.</span></p> <p><span>Polls of New Hampshire residents show McCain and Bush neck-and-neck.
